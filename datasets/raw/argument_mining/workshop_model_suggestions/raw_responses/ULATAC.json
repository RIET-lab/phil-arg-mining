The premises should logically entail the conclusion.\n2. **Claim**: A proposition that asserts something to be true or false, typically requiring justification or evidence.\n3. **Premise**: A proposition that provides evidence, justification, or logical support for a claim or conclusion.\n\n## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS\n1. **VERBATIM EXTRACTION ONLY**: Each ADU text must be copied EXACTLY from the paper with no modifications, paraphrasing, or combining of separate sentences.\n2. **NO HALLUCINATION**: Do not create, modify, or invent text that does not appear exactly in the source.\n3. **EXACT MATCHING**: Every word, punctuation mark, and spacing must match the original precisely.\n\n## DIRECTIONS\n1. **Identify Argumentative Discourse Units (ADUs)**  \n   - ADU = any contiguous text span functioning as a claim or a premise in the reasoning structure.\n   - **BE HIGHLY SELECTIVE**: Only include ADUs that are crucial to the overarching argument structure.\n   - Focus on significant claims and premises that contribute meaningfully to the argumentative flow.\n   - **AVOID NOISE**: Skip ADUs that are merely descriptive, tangential, or do not substantially advance the argument.\n   - Prioritize quality over quantity - fewer accurate, important ADUs are better than many insignificant ones.\n   - **EXTRACT ONLY**: Copy text spans exactly as they appear, without any modifications.\n2. **Classify each ADU**  \n   - Label = either `\"claim\"` or `\"premise\"`.  \n3. **Detect directed relations**  \n   - Relation = `\"support\"` or `\"attack\"`, from one ADU (source) to another (target).\n   - Map how ADUs connect to form reasoning chains.\n   - Focus on relationships between the most significant ADUs.\n   - Include relationships between premises that strengthen or weaken each other.\n4. **Verbatim spans**  \n   - Each `\"text\"` value must be copied EXACTLY from the paper with zero modifications.\n   - Do not paraphrase, summarize, or combine separate sentences.\n   - Do not add, remove, or change any words, punctuation, or spacing.\n   - If unsure about exact wording, skip that ADU rather than guess.\n\n## WHAT TO CAPTURE\n**INCLUDE ONLY:**\n- Main argumentative threads that are central to the paper's contribution\n- Core claims that represent the paper's primary arguments or findings\n- Key premises that provide essential support for major claims\n- Critical counterarguments and their refutations\n- Reasoning chains that demonstrate how main conclusions are derived\n\n**EXCLUDE (AVOID NOISE):**\n- Minor details, examples, or descriptive content that don't advance the argument\n- Tangential points or side discussions\n- Pure background information or literature review content\n- Methodological details unless they constitute argumentative claims\n- Obvious statements or commonly accepted facts\n- Redundant or repetitive argumentative content\n\n**GUIDING PRINCIPLE**: If removing an ADU would not significantly impact understanding of the paper's argumentative structure, it should be excluded.\n\n## QUALITY CONTROL\n- Before finalizing each ADU, verify the text exists exactly in the source\n- Prefer fewer, accurate ADUs over many potentially modified ones\n- When in doubt about exact wording, omit the ADU\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\nReturn **only** a single valid JSON object matching this schema.  \nDo **not** output any extra text, markdown, or explanations.\nDo **not** add comments.\n**RESPOND WITH ONLY**:\n```json\n{\n  \"ADUs\": {\n    \"<ADU_ID>\": {\n      \"text\": \"<exact span from paper>\",\n      \"label\": \"claim\" | \"premise\"\n    }\n    ...\n  },\n  \"relations\": [\n    {\n      \"source\": \"<ADU_ID>\",\n      \"target\": \"<ADU_ID>\",\n      \"type\": \"support\" | \"attack\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Call this idealist dominance of discussions on truth *Hegelianism* . American Hegelianism was divided into two schools: the *St. Louis Hegelians* whose views aligned with theses in social responsibility and social reform and the *New England Transcendentalists* whose interests revolved around literature and theology. British Hegelianism focused on metaphysics and ontology. Hegelianism appears to have waned after a fondness for scientific conclusions emerged, which was piqued by the promise of the natural and physical sciences.\n\nNowhere else was this naturalisation of truth more apparent than in an editorial published in an 1873 issue of the *Scientific American* .  The editorial, “Knowledge of the Truth,” was not an explicit indictment of idealism but it compelled readers to shed “imaginary cosmologies” for a return to the “greatest boon which man can ever possibly obtain: The Knowledge of the Truth” through observations of a mind-independent world.  The editorial marked the start of a three-pronged attack against Hegelianism.\n\nThe end of Hegelianism and the rise of contemporary discussions on truth was the result of the confluence of three sources: two infamous and a third all but overlooked.  First, the infamous death knell against Hegelianism was sounded by G.E. Moore and Bertrand Russell in 1902 and 1903, respectively.  Both favoured a correspondence theory of truth, and both found Hegelianism metaphysically and epistemologically repugnant.\n\nThe second source of contemporary discussion on truth was the pragmatists, especially William James, John Dewey, and Charles Sanders Peirce.  None of the theories on offer by any one of them necessarily has overlapping similarities with any of the other in the triumverate.  So, if we think of *the* pragmatist conception of truth, we’re likely making an error.  It is best to think of *a* pragmatist conception of truth.\n\nThird and finally, the overlooked but highly influential reason for the demise of Hegelianism and the rise of contemporary work on truth may be traced to the rise of realism.  In the United States, the “American Six” published a manifesto in 1910 that established the doctrinal priorities for philosophical thought in the twentieth century—including the investigation of “relational” accounts of truth.\n\nBeyond these few philosophers, work on truth in the early analytic period is largely unknown.  This is quite surprising given that publishing costs lowered dramatically, given that journals and other scholarly periodicals were popular, and given how many articles were written on truth.  This bibliography wishes to give a list of these other contributors’ works.\n\n*Note on Curation.* The content of the bibliography has been curated using two sources *JSTOR* and *PhilPapers* and search terms associated with truth-theories (e.g., “truth,” “fact,” “correspondence,” “coherence,” “pragmatism,” and “theory of truth”).  My focus has been articles published in peer-reviewed journals and monographs.  Hopefully, this list will be a helpful resource for those who work on the nature of truth (and the truth-criterion) in the early analytic period.\n\n1870s (6 works)\n\n- “The Knowledge of the Truth,” ( *Scientific American* [Mar 15, 1873] 28.11, pp. 160-161)\n- *Essays on Certain Logical Questions* , Richard Shute (Parker London.1874)\n    - Part I.
