Introduction\n\nThis  paper  examines  one  aspect  of Leibniz's philosophy of time  which, despite its rich  historical  lineage,  has been  somewhat  underplayed in recent  treatments  of his  metaphysics and  philosophy of science.  In  a  number of works explicating  his mature  metaphysics of space  and time,  Leibniz  emphasizes the distinction  between  space  and  time,  on the  one  hand  -  where\n\n\"space is  only the order of existing  for possibles existing simultaneously, just as time is  the order of existing for possibles that exist successively\"  -  and extension and duration,  on the other -  where \"extension is the extension of something,  just  as we say a multitude  or duration  is  a multitude  of something or a duration of something.\"!\n\nI will first consider  the  origins  of this  distinction in sources  important  to Leibniz.  I will next  attempt  to isolate  the  most  important aspects  of the  distinction. Leibniz,  perhaps  more  than  any  other  early  modem  metaphysician,  tended  to analyze  space  and time  analogously while  giving  the  lion's  share  of attention to  the  former.  I will  attempt  to  show  that  this  methodology, however  fruitful in  the  abstract  realm  of space  and  time,  is  more  problematic in  the  concrete realm of extension  and  duration.\n\n## 2.  Historical Background\n\nIt is  worth reviewing  briefly  the origin  of the time/duration  distinction  in sources Leibniz knew and drew upon.  In scholastic  thought,  duration  is a generic  notion coi:nmon to God and created  beings  in  so  far  as they  persist  in being.  Aquinas wntes  that whereas  God's  eternal  duration  lacks  any  succession or  'before and after'  created things  endure  successively: \"the  divine  Being  is simultaneously\n\n'TD ed. 0 by ~~;Ider  June 30,  1704;  Gottfried Wilhelm  Leibniz: Philosophical  Papers and Letters, R.  Ariew a~;~emker, Dordrecht 1989,  p. 536 (further as L);  Id.: Philosophical Essays, ed.  by á   Garber,  Indianapolis  1989,  p.  179 (further as AG).\n\nwithout succession; but with the world it is otherwise. \" 2 Created beings are in \"time itself, which is successive.\" Somewhat more systematically, Suarez explains,\n\n\"Duration can be divided first of all between permanent and successive. Permanent duration is said to be wholly simultaneous without successive parts;  successive duration is not permanent but rather one part always succeeds another.\" 4\n\nFor both Aquinas and Suarez, successive duration is closely associated with motion, in line with the canonical Aristotelian formula:  \"time is the measure of motion with respect to before and after'\" (although  Suarez and other late scholastics admit an  'imaginary  time'  with  successive structure prior to the creation of the world).\n\nWhile retaining the duration/time distinction, Descartes transforms it in two important respects. First, he makes all duration intrinsically successive, even the duration of God and of  rest:\n\n\"the duration which we find to be involved  in movement is certainly no different from the duration involved  in things which do not move.\" 6\n\nAfter cornrnenting to Burman that \"we can divide his duration into an infinite number of parts, even though God himself is not therefore divisible\" Burman objected that God's  \"eternity is all at once and once and for all.\" 7 Descartes' reply is curt: \"that is inconceivable.\" 8 But although he extends successive  duration to all things, Descartes does not separate it from things themselves, as Newton would later do. Rather,\n\n2  St. Thomas Aquinas: Summa Theologica, in: Great Books of the Western World, vols. 19 ~nd 20, transl.  by Fathers of the English  Dominican Province  Chicago,  Encyclopedia Britanruca 1952,  1,  46, 2 (further ST).\n\nB 4 Francisco Suarez: Disputationes Metaphysicae (1866), in: Opera Omnia, ed.  by Carolo erton, Paris, 50, 5,  I  (further MD). .\n\n3ST1,10,l.\n\n1  373 5 220a24;  Aristotle: Complete  Works, 2.  vols., ed. by Jonathan Barnes, Pnnceton 1971, (further ACM). l  T ery.\n\n6 Rene Descartes: Oeuvres De Descartes, 11 vols., edited by Charles Adam and Pau a~ated Paris  1983,  8A 27 (further AT); Id.: The  Philosophical  Writings Of  De~cartes, 2 vol;j~a(f~rther by John Cottingham/Robert  Stoothoff and Dugald Murdoch,  Cambndge  1988, 1 CSM).\n\n- 7 simul  et semel.

Second,  Descartes reserve  the  label  'time'  for  conventional measure  of duration  (clock  time). In order to measure  this  duration  common  to  all things,\n\n\"we  compare their  duration with  the  greatest and  most  regular motions, which give  rise  to years  and  days,  and  call  this  duration 'time'  .\" 11\n\nBut we must  not  conflate  duration itself,  which  is  intrinsic  to  all  things,  with its  temporal  measure,  which  is an intellectual abstraction:\n\n\"when  time  is distinguished from  duration  taken  in the  general  sense  ( duratione generaliter) and  called the measure of  movement, it  is  simply a  mode of thought.\" 12\n\nSo duration  is real,  successive and  intrinsic  to substance;  time  is ideal,  abstract and dependent  on the  human  intellect. 13\n\nThe young  Spinoza  follows  Descartes  closely  in his  conception oftime. In the  1663 Cogitata Metaphysica he defines  duration  as\n\n\"the  attribute  under  which  we  conceive the  existence of created things insofar as they  persevere in their  actuality.\" 14\n\nSo  conceived,  he notes, duration  is\n\n- :0AT 8A 39; CSM  I  214.\n- II AT 5  343;  CSMK  3  373.\n\nAT 8A 27; CSM  1  212.\n\n~;g3e Geoffrey  Gorham: \"Descartes on Time  and  Duration\",  in: Early Science and Medicine 12 14 7),  pp. 28-54.\n\n12 Ibid.\n\ntr  B~ch de  Spinoza:\n\nThe Principles of Cartesian Philosophy and  Metaphysical  Thoughts,\n\nS)'~sd ..  by S.

Leibniz on Space/Time vs. Extension/Duration\n\nFrom Leibniz's brief  comments  scattered  across  a number  of late  works,  a few salient features  of the  Space/Time  vs. Extension/Duration distinction  emerge:29\n\n## 3.1 Extension and Duration Fill Space and Time:\n\n## In the New Essays (1704),  Leibniz  comments on Locke's claim\n\n\"by this idea of solidity, the extension of body is distinguished from the extension of space.\"30\n\n23 Thomas Hobbes: Elementorum Philosophiae, Sectio Prima: De Corpore, ed. by K.

H. Nidditch,  Oxford 'II,  iv,  5:  126,  (further Essay).\n\nLeibniz insists \"there is no need to postulate two extensions, one abstract (for space) and the other concrete (for body).'?'  He compares this to number:  to conceive of three apples is not to conceive of the three-ness of the apples as distinct from the number. But neither are the apples nothing but their number ' nor a body nothing but its extension as the Cartesians hold.  Body is rather the concrete instantiation of  abstract space. He further observes that the \"concrete one is as it is only by virtue of the abstract one.\"32  His point is not that space somehow produces extension but that a body has motion or situation in relation to the abstract orderings of space and time.  We can even speak of a body filling a vacuum just as a couple might anticipate  a third child though they only have two.\n\nBut how do concrete bodies \"fill\" abstract space and time?33  For Cartesians,  the  questions  is  trivial:  corporeal  extension  fills  space because  it is space.  Similarly, duration is a universal attribute, not really or modally distinct from  things  themselves  as  noted  above.  Similarly,  a  substance  fills  time simply by persisting:  \"we should regard the duration of a thing as simply a mode under which we conceive the thing insofar as it continues to exist.\"34 But although Richard Arthur is surely right to note the Cartesian source of the Leibnizian distinction between concrete duration and abstract time,35  the Cartesian theories of extension and duration are ill-suited to Leibniz's  late metaphysics of body. This comes out clearly in Leibniz'  rejection of the Cartesian theory of extension and duration as attributes. Although he explicitly designates  extension  and  duration as \"attributes  of things\",36 Leibniz rejects the Cartesian conception of attributes, as he explains to De Volder:\n\n\"I do not at all approve of  the doctrine of attributes which people are formulating today:  as if  one  simple absolute predicate,  which they  call and  attribute, constituted a substance.\"37\n\n31\n\nGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz:\n\nNew Essays on the Human Understanding, ed.by  P.

But  given  his strong extension/duration parallelism -\n\n\"duration,  time and the enduring thing are in relation to one another in proportional to  \"the relations among extension, place and the placed thing';38 - he must  also  reject  the  Cartesian account  of duration  as  simple  persistence of substance.\n\nAlthough  I cannot  go  into  this  complex  issue  in detail,  it  is worth  considering  whether  Leibniz's alternative speculations about  the nature  and origin of extension  can  be  applied  easily  to  duration.  In the  1702  anti-Cartesian tract On Body and Force, Leibniz  explains  that  extension  is a \"simultaneous repetition\" or,  more  specifically,  the \"extension ofresistance, diffused  through  body\" while duration  is a \"successive repetition\" of some  sort. 39 He  does  not  explain more fully  how  resistance is diffused  nor how  succession  constitutes duration, since  his  main  concern is  to  confute the  Cartesian doctrine  that  extension is the whole  essence  of body.  And  in  the  1712/15 dialogue  between Philarete and Ariste  he stresses  that  duration  and  extension  do not \"stand  alone\"  but are rather  the  durations/extensions of something,  just  as  \"in  milk  there  is  an  extension  or diffusion  of whiteness.t'\"  He tells  us that  extension is the  diffusion of antitype41  but  neglects  to  explain  what  sort  of diffusion  duration is,  though he is  clear  that  it  is the  concrete,  temporal analogue  of extension: \"extension is to space  as  duration  is to time.\"?\n\nThis  alternative  to the  Cartesian picture  of extension  is developed  more fully in the long  exchange  with  De  Voider.  On De Voider's theory  of 'mathematical body'  -  basically  Cartesian res extensa Leibniz  comments:\n\n\"If you regard this mathematical body as space, it must be  correlated with time; if as extension, it must be correlated with duration\".  But \"as the physical body is to space so the status or series of things is to time\";  he says both \"add  to\" space and time.  ,,43\n\n38\n\nJ\n\n39\n\nune 23,  1699;  L 519.\n\nAG 251.\n\n41 A G 262á L 622 á\n\n40 Ibid.\n\n- 42 ' 43  AG 261;  L 621.\n- June 30,  1704;  L 536.\n\n## What  extension adds  is a\n\n\"simultaneous repetition  or  diffusion  of  some  particular  nature  or, what amounts to the same thing, a multitude of  things of this same nature which exist together with some order between them.?\"\n\nThis  multitude of things  are  the  simple  substances: \"extended things  involve a plurality of things  with  position, but  things  which  are  simple.\"45 The  correlated  notion  of duration  arises  from\n\n\"the law of the series\" which \"involves  all of the future states of that which we conceive to be the same - that is the very fact I say which constitutes the enduring substance. \"46\n\nWhile  there  is  much  obscurity  in this  account,  it  seems  to  apply  equally  well (  or ill)  to extension  and duration.  The  extension  of corporeal  substance  derives from  the  simultaneous order  of simple  substances manifesting the  force  of resistance and  its  duration derives from  the  successive states of  simple substances  following the  law  of the  series.\n\nIn the exchange  with Des Bosses,  Leibniz  introduces  a new,  controversial tool  to explain  corporeal  substance.  He  conceives  of extension  in a fairly  traditional  way:  \"the  extension  of a body  seems  to  be  nothing  but  the  continuation of matter  through  parts  external  to  each  other (partes extra partes), or  diffusion.?\"  But  since  it is fair to ask  about  the  simple  substances  or monads:\n\n\"by what compact can they make an extended being when they are  not themselves  extended?\" He says it \"seems further necessary to resort to something unifying which can be called absolute accidental  extension.\" 48\n\n## Without  this viniculum substaniale\n\n\"all  bodies  along with  all their  qualities  would  be  nothing  but well-founded phenomena, like the rainbow or an image in a mirror.\"49\n\n44 Ibid.\n\n- 45 June 20,  1703;  L 531.\n\n46 L 535.\n\n- 47 February 5,  1712;  L 600;  see also L 601.\n\n48\n\nL 602. . .

This  is unsurprising since  it is designed specifically to account  for the unity  of corporeal substance; still,  it is hard  to  see how  such a unity  characterizes duration and  succession. Perhaps a  substantial bond  is needed  to  account  for  the  unity  of my  body  at this  time;  but  how  does  it help to  account  for the  successive duration of my  body?  We  could,  of course,  call on  the  appetitions of monads, combined with  their  mutual perceptions and harmony  -  and  indeed  Leibniz assures us  that  the  substantial chain  \"corresponds  accurately in the  course  of nature  to  the  affections of the  monads,  that is,  to  their  perceptions and  appetite'f\"  -  but  then  we  will  have  abandoned a strictly  symmetrical treatment of extension and  duration.\n\n## 3.2  Space and Time are ideal; Extension and Duration are real\n\nI am sympathetic  with the view  that  space and time  are ideal, above  all, in virtue of being abstract,\" On this view,  we  should  expect  that extension  and  duration are real, above  all,  in virtue  of being concrete. This  is what  Leibniz  tells  Clarke:\n\n\"The parts  of time  and space  considered  in themselves,  are  ideal things  and therefore they perfectly resemble one another,  like two abstract units.  But it is not so with two concrete ones, or two real times, or two spaces filled up,  that is, truly actual.  \"52\n\nTo say that  extension  and  motion  are  concrete,  and  hence  real,  simply  means they inhere  in actually  existing  bodies,  whereas  space  and  time  are  merely  the possible  orders  of co-existence and  succession among  bodies.  Thus,  Leibniz has Philarete  observe  on his behalf:\n\n\"extension is to space as duration is to time. Duration and extension are attributes of things (attributs des choses), but time and space are taken to be outside of things (hors des choses) and serve to measure them.\"53\n\nAnd because  extension  and  duration  are  inherent,  but  space  and  time  are not:\n\nso  L 608.\n\nLetter  5, 27á AG 334á L 700 53AG261. ' ' .\n\n51 Art 52 hur: \"Leibniz's Theory of Time\".\n\n.\n\n\"Things keep their extension but they do not keep their space. Everything has its own extension, its own duration,  but it has not its own time and does not keep its.own  space.\"54\n\nThe space-time parallelism evinced in this passage is typical ofLeibniz.55 But even within the Clarke correspondence he also declares: \"From extension to duration, non valet  consequentiair'\" Leibniz  might  have  more  carefully heeded his own warning. Presumably, things keep their extension but give up their space when they move. But things do not 'move'  in time by transferring their duration out of temporal place. Although my very same extension can fill distinct spaces, my very same duration occupies only a single time (  even if I  time  travel).  Still, there  is a  sense  in which  even my  concrete duration could have filled a different time. Leibniz concedes this about the duration of the universe  as a whole: \"absolutely  speaking, one can conceive that a universe began earlier than it did.?\"  He says\n\n\"one might conceive something added to the beginning, so one might also suppose something taken off towards the end.\"58\n\nI can conceive that I was born a week earlier, and will die a year earlier, and in this sense my counterpart has the same duration but a different time. If we stick to this world, however, the duration and time of something do not come apart in the ways its extension and space routinely do. As Leibniz says,\n\n\"God created things at what time he pleased, for this depends on the things he resolved to create. But things being once resolves, together with their relations, there no longer remains any choice.\"59\n\nIt is worth noting one other asymmetry regarding the reality of extension and duration.  Against Clarke's  assertion of the eternity of time, Leibniz observes\n\n54 Letter 5  46; AG 337; L 703. . id l 55  \"the analogy between time and space will easily make it appear that the one is as merely 1 ea as the other\" (Letter 5, 49;  AG 340).\n\n56 Letter 5,  74:  AG 54;  L 711.\n\n57 Letter 5, 56; AG 342; L 707  .\n\n58  Ibid.\n\n59 Letter 5,  56;  AG 342; L 708.\n\n.55  But ion  to\n\ná efully\n\n1veup erring\n\nn  can\n\n(even ration\n\nonof t  uni-\n\n,  and f we\n\n.ome and\n\nves deal\n\n\"whatever exists of time and duration, being successive,  perishes continually and how can a thing exist eternally which (to speak exactly)  does not exist at all?\"60\n\nHe draws the conclusion  that time  \"can  only  be an ideal thing\"  and furthermore \"the  analogy .between  time  and  space  will  easily  make  it evident  that  one  is as merely  ideal  as the  other.\"?'  Richard  Arthur  rightly  points  out  that  the  fleeting nature  of duration  clearly  does  not  extend  to  extension.62 A more  problematic implication  of the  argument  is that  time  and  duration  are  equally  ideal,  undercutting  the  supposed  reality  of the  latter.  However,  Leibniz  makes  it clear  that his concern  about  time  is not  so much  the that  it is fleeting  but that  it is reduces to points  or instants: \"nothing  of time  does ever  exist but instants,  and an instant is not even  itself  a part  of time. \"63  He  does  not  allege  this  about  duration  or the time  'filled'  by  an enduring  thing:  on the contrary  he says:\n\n\"if  in saying that a thing is eternal is meant only that the thing endures eternally, I have no objection.\" 64\n\nSo on this  point,  space  and  time  are  asymmetrical, but  the  crucial  symmetry between  real  extension  and  duration  is maintained.\n\n- 3.3  Space and Time are Homogeneous and Infinitely Divisible; Extension and  Duration are Heterogeneous and Reducible to Parts\n\n## Leibniz holds  that\n\n\"space is something absolutely uniform and without the things placed in it,  one point in  space absolutely  does  not  differ  in  anything  from  another  point  in space\" and \"the case is the same with respect to time.\"65\n\n## And we have  already  noted  his  observation that\n\n\"the parts of time and space considered in themselves, are ideal things and therefore  they perfectly  resemble one another, like two abstract units.  But it is not so\n\n60 Letter  5  49á  L 705 ' ' á\n\n- 62 Art 63 hur:  \"Leibniz's  Theory of Time\", p. 282f.\n- 61 Ibid.\n- Letter  5  49á  L 705 64  Ibid. , , .\n\nss  L etter  3,  5f; AG 325;  L 682f.\n\nwith  two  concrete ones.\"66 So \"I  deny  that  there  are  any  two  parts  of water  perfectly  alike,  or  any  two  other  bodies  perfectly indiscernible from  one  another.\"?\n\nAnd he tells De Voider that, unlike the parts of space abstractly considered e.g.  geometrical objects, \"in  nature there cannot be two bodies  at the  same time perfectly similar and equal.?\"  Later in this careful exchange Leibniz insists that whereas \"continuous quantity is something ideal\", pertaining strictly to possibles, \"in actual things nothing is indefinite\" [ ... ] they are \"composed as a number is composed of  unities.  \"69  The continuity of space/time  vs. the aggregate structure of extension/duration  is also noted in letter to Princess Sophie:\n\n\"although matter consists of a numberless collection of simple  substances, and although duration along  with  motion  likewise consists in  a mass  of momentary instants, it  must  nevertheless be  said  that  space  is  not  at  all  composed of points not  time  of mstants.\"?\"\n\nAlthough  it is plausible that the parts of concrete extension or matter satisfy the principle of the identity of indiscemibles, thus distinguishing concrete extension from ideal space, it is far from clear that the principle extends to the parts of duration.  In his concise but path-breaking treatment of time and duration, Descartes does not go so far as to postulate duration independent of substance; like Leibniz, he rejected empty time as much as empty space.  How-  . ever, he insisted in opposition to the long Aristotelian tradition that made time the number of motion that\n\n\"the  duration which  we  find  to be  involved in  movement is  certainly no  different  from  the  duration involved in  things  which  do not  move.\"?'\n\nLeibniz seems to be with Aristotle in ruling out changeless duration. But, for the sorts of reasons  given by Descartes -  we do not reckon the duration of something strictly by the changes it undergoes - it is implausible to deny concrete duration to unchanging things. Leibniz insists that, unlike the parts of abstract time and space,  the parts of concrete duration and extension do not\n\n66 Letter  5, 27:  AG  334.\n\n67 Letter  5, 25; AG  334; Cf.,  Letter 5, 2lf.\n\n68 June  20  1703; AG  175.\n\n69  January 19,  1706; AG  185.\n\n70 1705; GP  VII,  562.\n\n71 AT  SA 27;  CSM  1  212.\n\nt,\n\ne\n\nv\n\ns\n\n\"perfectly  resemble  one another.?\" Similarly,  he tells De Volder  that \"nothing is permanent in things  except  the  law  itself  which  involves  a continuous suecession.\"73 But the insistence  that  all duration  in bodies  involves  change  seems to be motivated only by  a dogmatic attachment to the  analogy  between  extension  and  duration.\n\nIn the  exchange  with  Clarke  he  insists  that  the  same  arguments which rule out an extramundane spatial  vacuum  also  exclude  a local  or intramundane vacuum:  \"for  they  differ  only  as  greater  or  less.\"74 But  it  is  not  clear  that  the corresponding temporal  vacua  differ  only  in this  way.  An  extramundane temporal  vacuum  is an abstract  time  before  the  world  began  (  or between  worlds), which Leibniz confutes repeatedly in  the exchange with Clarke. An  intradmundane temporal  void  is the  cessation of change  of the  world  for  some finite  duration, like  the  \"freezer world\"  of Sidney  Shoemaker's thought experiment.\" Certain of Leibniz' arguments against  extramundane time  might be as effective  against  mere  freezes,  for example,  there  would  be no sufficient reason  or  even  distinction among  freezes of  different lengths.76 But  others seem not to apply.  Thus,  Leibniz  says\n\n\"extension  must be the affection of something extended.  But if that space is empty, it will be an attribute without a subject, an extension without something extended.t\"?\n\nBut  a  frozen  world, unlike  time  before creation, does  not  posit  an  enduring nothing.78\n\n72 Letter 5,  27;  AG 334.\n\n73 January 21,  1704;  L 534.\n\n74 Letter  4,  7:  AG 328; see also Letter 5,  33.\n\n- 75 Sidney Shoemaker: \"Time Without Change\",  in: Journal of Philosophy 66 (1969),  pp.  363381.\n- 76 Letter 5,  55;  AG 341.\n\n78 So I think Futch rightly emphasizes the importance of such considerations in Leibniz's case for reductionism about space and time.  Michael  Futch: Leibniz's  Metaphysics of Time and Space, New York 2008, p.  43f. I  do not agree they extend as forcefully to concrete duration. Futch  emphasizes  Leibniz' remark that \"if space is an affection or property of the things which ism space, the space will sometimes be the affection of one body,  sometimes of another body ~  ...  ]  buUhis is a strange property or affection which passes from one subject to another.\" (L 5, 9) This does not apply to duration or extension since,  as we have noted, \"Things keep their ebxte.nsion but they do not keep their space.  Everything has its own extension, its own duration, ut it h á as not its own time and does not keep its own space.\" (Letter 5, 46;  AG 337).\n\n77 Letter  4,  9; AG 328.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNothing that Leibniz maintains that any vacuum violate the principle of sufficient reason, since there would be no reason to prefer one ratio of matter to void than another, 79 Michael Futch has suggested in passing that the same applies to local temporal vacuum:  \"one would be unable to provide sufficient reason for one particular ration of change to empty time.\"80  I'm not sure the case is parallel,  especially  if we  allow the world to  endure through a local freeze, since it seems God might have reason to prefer a 'day  ofrest'  for the world vs. a week ofrest. In any case, the application of Leibniz'  argument to time would seem to entail that there is never any rest or stasis, but only maximal change, in the material world. 81\n\nThere is a final  asymmetry between local spatial vs.  temporal vacua ' which Leibniz himself notices in another context. But this asymmetry favors intramundane spatial voids as compared with freezer-worlds. In the New  Essays he notes this difference: \"If there were a local vacuum within extension we could \"determinate its size\" by the surrounding bodies.\n\n\"But if there were a vacuum in time,  i.e. a duration without a change,  it would be impossible to determine its length.\"82\n\nSince it is one-dimensional, a limited changeless duration is less 'accessible' empirically than a local void;83 but it is more intelligible ontologically since it . does not lack a subject. 84\n\n## 4.  Conclusion\n\nLeibniz'  commitment to parallelism in the abstract realm of space and time falters in the concrete realm of extension and duration.\n\n79 Letter 4,  46;  AG 332.\n\n8 ¡ Futch: Leibniz's  Metaphysics, p.  51.\n\n81 I'm  not  sure whether  this  is  a principle  Leibniz  can live  with.  He  does  say  that \"exactly speaking there is not any one body that is perfectly and entirely at rest.\" (Letter 5,  53;  AG 341) But the target here is absolute rest.\n\n82 Letter 4,  46; AG 332. á T 83  Futch makes a similar point about this passage in his  compelling case against  the possibi ity ofLeibnizian  vacuums,  in: Leibniz's  Metaphysics, p. 49. . f\n\n84  Clarke pressed Leibniz that mere order or succession does not seem to determine quanu~ i time (Clarke letter 4,  41; L 695). Leibniz responded that in \"if the time is greater there ~1 ilar more successive and similar states interposed there will be fewer\" (L 5  105;  L 7151 A~t:~bsuggestion is made in the lnitia Rerum around the same time (L 666f.). But as Art f :ntity. served this account is sketchy and far less detailed than the parallel  account of spatra qu Richard Arthur: Leibniz, Cambridge UK 2014, p. 164.",
