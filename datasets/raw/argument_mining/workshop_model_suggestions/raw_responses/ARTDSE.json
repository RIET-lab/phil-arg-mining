Please cite the published version  https://doi.org/10.1007/s11229-022-04003-3*\n\n**1. \tIntroduction**\n\nA long-standing philosophical tradition has vindicated the epistemically privileged status that mechanically produced images (e.g., photographs, videos) bear, in certain respects, over other hand-made pictorial types such as paintings and drawings. According to the most traditional view, the paradigm cases of photographs (and, by extension, other mechanically-produced images such as videos), given the automated, purely causal, mind-independent way in which they are produced, are bearers of Gricean *natural meaning* (Walton 1984; Currie 1999; Hopkins 2010). In the same way as when you see smoke you can infer there is fire, when you see a scene in a paradigm photograph, you can infer that such scene existed in the world very much in the way it is presented in the picture. Paradigm photographs, according to this line of thought, let us see the objects they depict (Walton 1984), are traces of their subject matter (Currie 1999) and convey factive pictorial experiences (Hopkins 2010). Furthermore, viewers’ knowledge of photographs’ ‘objective character’ warrants their acceptance of perceptual beliefs they form as a result of these experiences (Walden 2008). For some, photographs are sources of perceptual knowledge (Cavedon-Taylor 2013), for others, photographs are *spatially agnostic* sources of information (Cohen and Meskin 2004), and yet, for others, photographs are a reliable means to convey considerable amounts of depictively encoded information (Abell 2010).\n\nWhile these views have always been confronted with the challenge posed by the existence of manipulated images, the recent proliferation of deepfakes and other digitally produced deceptive representations has revived the debate on the epistemic robustness of photography and other mechanically produced images (Rini 2020; Harris 2021; Fallis 2021; Chalmers 2022). Rini (2020) has recently argued that the proliferation of deepfakes threatens to jeopardize the epistemic credentials of images by undermining their role as epistemic backstop, i.e., as mechanisms that contribute to regulate and sustain our testimonial knowledge. Along similar lines, Fallis claims that the existence of deepfakes pose a *serious threat* to the reliability and the epistemic value of videos. Fallis adopts a Skyrmsian account of how signals carry information (Skyrms, 2010) to argue that the existence of deepfakes significantly reduces the information that images carry about the world, which undermines their reliability as a source of evidence. Thus, he suggests that “as a result of deepfakes, videos [and by extension photographs, as a type] now carry less information about the events that they depict\" (Fallis 2021, 627).\n\nIn this paper, we will focus on Fallis’ version of the challenge, but our results can be generalized to address similar pessimistic views such as Rini’s. More generally, our aim is to offer an account of the epistemic robustness of photography and videos that allows us to understand these systems of representation as continuous with other means of information transmission we find in nature. The idea is not to explain the epistemic advantages that photographs, and other mechanically produced images have over other pictorial types; in this sense, we will not discuss the virtues and problems of other proposals available in the literature. Yet, our account captures and builds on central intuitions of various theories of photography as well as on skeptical views triggered by them. This account will then give us the necessary tools to put Fallis’ claims into perspective.\n\nUsing a richer approach to animal signaling based on *the signaling model of communication* (Maynard-Smith and Harper 2003) *,* we will claim that, while it might be true that deepfake technology increases the probability of obtaining false positives, the dimension of the epistemic threat involved might still be negligible. This is because, according to this model, the reliability of a signaling system crucially depends on the existence of a series of mechanisms enforced by the system to maintain its stability. In section 2 we describe how these mechanisms work in the natural world, and in section 3, we show that this model also applies to cultural artifacts such as videos and photographs. In section 4 we analyze Fallis’ view in more detail, and we argue that, although some of these mechanisms might be losing efficacy, deepfakes and other misleading representations are far from being a *serious threat.* There are good reasons to believe that the signaling systems in question—photography and video—are still epistemically reliable and robust indicators of the existence of objects or states of affairs with the appearance displayed by the image and that they will probably continue to be reliable in the future. In section 5 we indicate the scope of our view and, finally, in section 6 we compare our view with other accounts of the epistemic value of photographs as well as with other less pessimistic views on the effect of deepfakes.\n\n**2 \tAnimal Signals**\n\nPhotographs and videos are technologies that allow us to communicate information. As such, it is reasonable to conceive of them as being continuous with other means of transmission of information or communication that can be found in nature and, hence, to be explained, at least partially, by general theories of communication. As we said before, our aim is to account for the epistemic robustness of photography as reliable means of information transmission and, to do this, we will rely on the *signaling model of communication* : a comprehensive and inclusive idea of communication frequently used in evolutionary biology. In this section we will present central ideas of this model and in the following section we’ll apply them to the case of photography and videos.\n\nAccording to the signaling model of communication a *signal* is a feature or behavior of an entity that was designed for its ability to successfully convey the information that it does—where the design in question should be understood as being the product of natural, technological, or cultural selection. The fact that design is involved differentiates signals from *cues* , which are other features or behaviors that may convey information but that were *not* designed for that reason. For example, our veins may visibly pop up when we are angry, but this feature—vascular dilatation—did not evolve or was not designed to express anger (Green 2007, 5; Maynard-Smith and Harper 2003, 4). By contrast, some facial expressions and muscles do indeed appear to have evolved to express and communicate basic emotions (Rinn 1984)—indeed, some of them can be *involuntarily* triggered when humans and even primates feel these emotions (Ekman 1997). Similarly, in many birds, reptiles and fish bright colors indicate health to potential mates.\n\nPartly because they have been designed to convey certain information, signals robustly correlate with, and are thereby reliable indicators of, certain states of affairs. For example, if the body of a snake displays characteristically bright colors, we can normally infer just by looking at it that the snake is venomous. Yet signals can also convey misinformation; sometimes this is due to simple error, e.g., a vervet monkey that performs an eagle-alarm-call when seeing a plane produces a false representation by mistake. In other cases, however, signals are purposely made to carry misinformation. For example, some non-venomous milk snakes ( *Lampropeltis triangulum* ) mimic the red-black-yellow stripes of venomous coral snakes. By doing this, they succeed in deceiving their predators, who are used to associating this appearance with toxicity, and ultimately avoid being attacked (Greene and McDiarmid, 1981). The phenomenon of mimicry is a paradigmatic example of designed misinformation: looking like something else to lead the observer to error.\n\nNow, it is central to the stability of the signaling system that it is reliable—if non-venomous milk snakes become too frequent, for instance, the once efficient signaling system of venomous snakes would lose its efficacy and would eventually lose its role as a signal. For this reason, different mechanisms safeguard the reliability and veracity of the signals. Some prominent ways of doing so are (i) existence of common interest (ii) developing signals that can only be faked with great difficulty as a result of limitations on the structure or design of the organism ( *indices* ); (iii) making the signal somehow costly to produce ( *handicaps* ) and (iv) punishing cheaters. Before establishing the parallelism with photography and video, let us briefly illustrate each of these mechanisms.\n\nAccording to the first proposed mechanism, signals tend to be reliable when sender and receiver have common interest. ‘Common interest’ is a technical concept that can be understood in various ways, but some paradigmatic examples should suffice to illustrate the category: bees in a colony have a shared interest in the maintenance of the nest, and parent birds and nestlings are interested in the survival of nestlings. In biology, a standard reason the interests of sender and receiver are aligned is genetic relatedness, but there can be common interest as well between individuals that don’t share their genes; for instance, between symbionts or between mating pairs that need the survival of the other individual for health or reproduction purposes. As the famous Sir Philip Sidney game illustrates, if the interests of sender and receiver are aligned, signals tend to be honest (Maynard-Smith, 1991; 1994). A classic example is begging behavior: ‘begging’ refers to a series of behaviors that nestlings perform when a parent bird arrives at the nest which typically involves raising the head, opening the mouth, and performing some characteristic sounds. Begging is usually understood as a signal of hunger; since both parents and offspring are interested in nestlings being fed when needed, the signal tends to be honest (Searcy and Nowicki, 2005, ch. 2). To the extent that both sender and receiver have common interest, neither has an incentive to deceive the other, so the reliability of the signal tends to be maintained.\n\nThe second mechanism involves *indices* . The idea of an index can be illustrated by the ‘vibrating game’ of funnel-web spiders ( *Agelenopsis aperta* ). These spiders compete against each other over webs, and their respective weight plays a crucial role in determining the winner. According to Susan Riechert (1978), if one of the spiders outweighs the other by 10% or more, the lighter spider retreats, avoids the fight, and thereby loses. The spiders ‘know’ which of the two is heavier or lighter because they signal their weight by vibrating the web—a signal that the other spider senses and interprets. Now, given that the vibration depends on the weight, and the weight is a given feature of the structure or body of the spider, the signal (vibration) that the spider sends is constrained by its actual weight. For this reason, the signal is an index: given the limitations of the spider’s own body, the vibration reliably indicates information about its weight. The perceived vibration of the web would be different had the weight of the spider been higher or lower, but given the limitations and constraints imposed by the spider’s actual body weight, there is not much it can do to *seem* heavier. Of course, there are ways to fake the signal or send misleading information: an external agent—for example, the scientist in Riechert’s case—can *tweak* the system by adding a weight to the lighter spider's back. In this case, the signal will send misleading information to the contender and will thereby turn the *cheating* spider into a winner (Green 2007, 50–1; Maynard-Smith and Harper 2003, 4; Riechert 1978). But only in this complicated way would it be possible to overcome the limitations imposed by the spider’s body structure.\n\nIn addition to developing signals that are indices, signals can also safeguard their reliability by being *handicaps* . According to the original conception of this term, a handicap is a signal that is difficult to fake because its signaler has to be able to afford a high *strategic cost* involved in the production of the signal (Zahavi and Zahavi 1997; Maynard-Smith and Harper 2003). As a result, the reliability of the signal is secured because the cost imposed by the production of the signal is associated with sender quality. In the case of mating signals, for instance, low quality males are unable to produce the signal or produce it less efficiently than high quality males. A classic example of a handicap is the ostentatious tail of peacocks. Developing such tails is costly to peacocks because it involves a substantial amount of energy to grow the feathers, and displaying the tail makes them less agile and more prone to be captured by predators. However, precisely because it is costly to develop, their flashy tails give male peacocks a sexual advantage, not only because it is visually attractive, but because it signals the fitness and resources of the animal. Displaying flamboyant tails then signals, shows, or provides direct evidence of peacocks’ physical power.\n\nNow, handicaps need not always involve a high cost for the signaler. Fake signals can also be prevented as long as the cost of cheating–however minimal it may be–is still higher than the cost of sending an honest signal (Hurd 1995). For example, carotenoids are pigments used by many organisms to produce a yellow-orange-red coloration, but also play an important role in certain physiological processes, such as regulating the immune and antioxidant systems (Svensson and Wong, 2011). Thus, there is a trade-off between using them in ornamental displays and in these physiological processes; only organisms that already possess a strong immune and antioxidant systems can invest a significant amount of carotenoids in coloration. In contrast, individuals who need to use carotenoids for crucial physiological processes produce darker colorations or no coloration at all (Alonso-Álvarez et al. 2004). As a result, for an individual with weak immunological and detoxification systems, the cost of devoting carotenoids to coloration is higher than for individuals that already have strong systems, because this choice will put the life of the former into serious danger. In sum, the fact that a signal is costly to produce or more costly to fake than keeping it honest contributes to safeguarding the reliability of the signaling system and keeping cheaters at bay.\n\nYet another mechanism to vouchsafe the reliability of signaling systems relies on punishing cheaters. Organisms that cheat or fake a signal might have to assume the cost of being punished in the event of being caught. An example of this social or punishment cost is the case of rhesus monkeys ( *Macaca mulatta* ) that are harassed if they fail to give a call when they find a food source (Hauser 1992).\n\nThese four mechanisms, among others, contribute to keeping the signaling system reliable enough for communication to persist. Ultimately, whether it pays off senders and receivers to keep sending and responding to signals will also depend on other aspects, such as the costs and benefits of true and false signals. As models in *signal detection theory* suggest, a signal system can only be stable if receiver response is adaptive on average (Wiley, 1994). For instance, one of the main functions of a flower’s shape and color is to signal pollen availability to pollinators. Now, suppose a population of honest signalers is invaded by a certain amount of flower mimics that lack pollen and pollinators are unable to distinguish them. If responding to a fake flower is very costly (e.g., because it is a carnivorous flower), then few of them could be enough for pollinators to stop responding to the signal. More generally, if at some point the costs of responding to false signals outweigh the benefits of correct signals, receivers will stop reacting to them and the whole signaling system will collapse. In contrast, if visiting a fake flower is not very costly for pollinators (e.g. because they don’t risk any significant danger), while missing an honest signaler full of pollen is very costly, it might pay off pollinators to keep responding to the signal even if fake flowers are much more common than honest ones (Godfrey-Smith, 1996; Searcy and Nowicki, 2005).\n\nA consequence of this reasoning is that the overall stability and reliability of the signaling system matters not only to honest signalers, but also to mimics and other organisms producing fake signals, even when they pose, in principle, a potential threat. If signals stop being trustworthy, then receivers might start ignoring them, which would cause senders to stop sending signals. If this point is reached, fakers cannot benefit anymore from copying the signal. Therefore, both honest and dishonest signalers need signals to be reliable to some extent. This idea will provide a powerful basis for building an argument against Fallis’ challenge.\n\nWrapping up, according to the signaling model of communication signals are designed to convey specific information and, as such, they typically and reliably do so. Certainly, signals are frequently faked or mimicked. Yet different mechanisms sustain the reliability of genuine signals and, in most cases, avoid the collapse of the signaling system. Of course, the list of mechanisms we provided is not exhaustive, but it highlights some of the main processes that generally sustain the reliability of communication. The key question, of course, is whether these mechanisms can also be identified in the context of photographs and other mechanically produced images. In the remainder we will defend a positive answer.\n\n**3.     Photography (&amp; video) as signaling systems**\n\nWe propose to follow this model when thinking about photographs and videos.  In the same way that signaling models have been successfully applied to economics (Spence 1973, 2002), anthropology (Bird and Smith, 2005) or management (Connelly, 2011), we think they can also illuminate certain aspects of photography. First, it is plausible to conceive of photographs as signals in the sense mentioned above: artifacts that are designed to convey the information that they do. Like other natural signals, photographs are the product of a mechanism or a series of mechanisms that are themselves the product of selection; although, in this case, the relevant selection is cultural and technological. As historians and theorists of photography frequently point out, the photographic mechanism was the culmination of a series of technological refinements to record actual scenes of the world with sufficient precision in a way that did not necessarily require artistic competence. During the 18th Century, many artists and scientists used the *camera obscura* —a close ancestor of the modern photographic system—to obtain lifelike, accurate representations by copying the projected image of an actual, real-world scene. At first, these cameras did require some technical and artistic expertise, but popular demand encouraged the production of different machines inspired by the same principles that were portable and easy to use by amateurs (Davenport 1999). If one follows the later development of the photographic mechanisms from the Daguerreotype to the now omnipresent smartphone cameras, there is evidence that this desire of capturing lifelike appearances of real objects and scenes of the world, in such a way that does not require much technical or artistic competence, has driven the design of probably the majority of the photographic mechanisms that are involved in the photographic process up to this date. And as it turned out, the goal of capturing real scenes and objects with a reasonably high degree of accuracy and the aim of making photographic mechanisms easy to use by amateurs, frequently led to a common solution: making the process as automatic as possible. On the one hand, automatism – together with the development of precise lenses and other technologies – guarantees, to some extent, that the relevant information is preserved from the original scene, minimizing the loss. On the other hand, it makes the photographic mechanism easy to use by unskilled enthusiasts. As many theories of photography have emphasized, the photographic mechanism has developed in such a way as to *standardly* provide a robust causal and counterfactual correlation between the photographic images and the visual appearance of real existent objects of the world that does not essentially depend on the mental states or intentions of the agent taking the picture (Walton 1984, Currie 1999). This, in turn, facilitates the preservation of information from the moment of the shot until the last stage of the photographic process in a way that does not require much or any technical skill.\n\nAs a result of this cultural and technological pressure and selection, photographs have become signals that typically show or provide evidence of the appearance of real existing objects or scenes. Nonetheless, like other natural signals, photographs can carry misinformation and indeed they do so very often to different degrees. Again, as it is the case with animal signals, this is sometimes due to error—a cracked lens, for instance, might produce photographs that falsely represent the real world—or because the image has been purposely made to carry misinformation either for expressive or deceptive purposes. A photograph can be manipulated to deceive the viewer—as many infamous pictures produced by Stalin’s propaganda machine or recent deepfake images exploited for political interests. But they can also be purposely manipulated to achieve aesthetic goals–like Jeff Wall’s *A Sudden Gust of Wind (after Hokusai).* These manipulations do not necessarily prevent these pictures from being photographic images (Atencia-Linares 2012); not any more, at least, than a fake smile or an intentional frown cease to be a smile or a frown (Grice 1989, 216). But, as it is the case with other signaling systems, even when token signals can carry misinformation (purposely or not) the technological and cultural development of photographic processes has generated mechanisms to vouchsafe the overall reliability, veracity and life-likeliness of photographic images, so that, even if mimics and *non-honest* signals proliferate, they remain relatively low compared, in proportion, to honest signals.\n\nWe argued above that one of the mechanisms that accounts for the stability of signaling systems in the natural world is common interest between sender and receiver. Common interest has been a significant driving force in the history of photography, but it is still the case today: in a wide-range of social practices, from family albums to art-illustration books, from personal Instagram accounts and commercial websites such as Airbnb or Ebay to amateur and professional photojournalism, photographs are used for illustrative and informative purposes. In all these cases, both senders and receivers demand a form of transmission of accurate information about the world, and this structure of interests pushes photographs in the direction of really capturing the appearance of objects and events. It seems reasonable to claim that, for as long as there is social interest on both sides in obtaining images that capture the appearance of things very much in the way they look in real life, there will be social pressure to keep producing these representations.\n\nCommon interest is not the only mechanism sustaining the stability of the system. A second mechanism is to produce indices, i.e., signals that are difficult to manipulate due to limitations on the structure of the organism (remember the ‘vibrating game’ of spiders). We also think that photographs (at least a limited number of them) are *indices* in this sense: the very structure of some photographic mechanisms imposes limitations and constraints that make it difficult for certain photographic images to be faked or manipulated, e.g., to produce photographic images that depict non-existent objects or events or that severely distort or misrepresent the appearance of the relevant scene. Paradigmatic examples of this category are photographic devices that are either irreproducible or direct-positives, e.g., daguerreotypes, pannotypes, polaroids, and diapositives. These devices do not completely avoid manipulation but restrict at least one major technique used for creating non-realistic or fictional scenes in analogue photography, namely, composition printing. As in the case of the spider who cannot do much to alter its weight, there is not much that can be done in these devices to alter the signal given the constraints of the design.\n\nMore generally, there is a more pervasive and serious constraint motivating the use of the category of *index* in the context of photography: automatism. As is frequently mentioned in the literature on photography, many—and nowadays probably the majority—of photographic systems are in some way automatized. The fact that the system as a whole, or parts of thereof, are automatic limits to some extent the intervention of agents. In this way, the mechanism itself guarantees to a certain degree that the information is preserved without intentional alteration throughout the production of the image. For this reason, it can be claimed that, at least to the extent that some photographs are the product of direct-positive, automatic, or semi-automatic mechanisms, these photographs are *indices* in the way described: they are signals that, due to the limitations of the mechanism that produces them, make it difficult to obtain images of non-existent objects or very inaccurate images of real objects or scenes *.*\n\nThis way of vouchsafing the reliability and veracity of the signaling system is clearly limited to photographs which are the product of very specific mechanisms. Another more widespread way to make it difficult to obtain non-veridical photographic images is by making them *costly to produce* – or given the same resources available, much more costly to produce than the honest signal. In other words, following the notion we explained above, we can also conceive of photographs as *handicaps* .\n\nAlthough manipulated photographic images are abundant in the history of photography, they are normally more costly to produce than images that reliably depict the appearance of whatever was in front of the camera at the moment of the shot— where the cost here can be measured in terms of the level of technical skills, amount of technical resources, cognitive effort (creativity) or time spent on the process. In the early days of photography, the cost of producing any photograph was already high and required a minimum level of training and investing in technology. In this context, producing doctored photographs was not only virtually impossible for most people, but also more costly for skilled photographers. Daguerreotypes were not impossible to manipulate but, since composition printing was not available, photographers had to find ingenious, frequently complicated, and time-consuming ways to mask parts of the scene and play with exposition times. But even when composition printing and negative/positive processing became an option, and photographic technology became much more accessible, photographic manipulation still required access to technical devices and a substantive amount of technical and artistic skill. For example, pictures such as H.P. Robinson’s *Fading Away* , Wanda Wulz’s *Io Gatto* or Jerry Uelsmann’s *Untitled, 1984* require various technical resources (e.g., up to twelve enlargers, in Uelsmann’s case), impressive technical expertise in controlling the light, and substantial investment of time and cognitive effort in planning and imagining the final picture. There is nothing in the nature of the medium that prevents photographs from representing fictional entities and scenes (Atencia-Linares 2012). However, it seems reasonable to think that any of these photographs involves significantly more costs than what it would have taken to produce a photograph of an existing scene using standard photographic mechanisms and procedures. Indeed, this is part of the reason why we value some of these images highly as photographs.\n\nNow, the reader can think that this might be the case with analogue photography, but surely things are easier with digital technologies. This is not entirely obvious. It is true that these technologies are widespread and provide sophisticated ways to retouch and manipulate images. Nonetheless, we think it is still the case that, *overall* , manipulation with digital technologies is also costly compared to the cost involved in taking an honest photograph with similar technologies. Even a child can take a photograph with a smartphone, but one still needs a certain degree of technical skill to competently use Photoshop or any alternative software in a way that produces an image that successfully and convincingly achieves the look of a photograph, especially if it involves a complex composition;also, Photoshop and similar technologies are an extra step (i.e. extra cost) that one needs to add to the process of production. Things are even more complicated in the case of deepfakes. Deepfakes are widespread nowadays, but producing a relatively simple convincing deepfake that is hard to detect is far from easy. It is true that software for creating deepfakes is generally free and open source. However, one still requires a graphics processing unit (GPU), significant graphics-editing and audio-dubbing skills, considerable time and a relatively large amount of high-quality video and audio files both of the source and the target person (both of which should look relatively similar). If this is so, to the extent that obtaining images that accurately depict the appearance of real existing objects is typically less costly than producing an unreliable or non-veridical image, photographs are also *handicaps* in the sense explained above.\n\nOf course, as it is the case with indices, the reliability of handicaps as a way of vouchsafing the honesty of the signal is limited in scope. There might be images that are not particularly costly to produce—or not more costly than an honest signal—but that still inaccurately depict the relevant scene or object. There are *apps* available that transform faces just with a click (e.g., AgingBooth or FaceApp). Maybe in cases like these, one could say that the cost involved in obtaining an unreliable image is not higher than the cost that would have been invested in producing an honest photograph. However, there are two things to consider here. First, most common photographic errors, as well as some camera filters that can be used in smartphones, do not completely distort a photographic image, and render it utterly misleading and inaccurate. And, while some easy-to-use digital *apps* such as AgingBooth or FaceApp do so, they typically target specific objects—i.e., faces in close-up—so they cannot be used to distort all sorts of scenes and their scope of action is limited. Secondly, even if not all photographs are handicaps, that only shows that this mechanism is, like others, limited in scope, but that does not mean that the mechanism is not efficient in partially protecting the stability of the signaling system.\n\nA fourth mechanism that is present in the natural world that we can also find to some extent in photography is some forms of punishment of cheaters. Unlike some of the other mechanisms mentioned above, punishment of cheaters operates mostly at the level of certain social practices where photographs are used (see Harris, 2021; Chalmers, 2022). Epistemic practices, such as photojournalism, and scientific publications, for instance, establish severe measures against practitioners who incur in photographic manipulation. And even in less regulated practices such as fashion photography and social media, there is an increasing social pressure to diminish extensive retouching on pain of being publicly shamed.\n\nOverall, all these mechanisms are limited in scope, but their joint effect is far from negligible. As with other natural signals, the efficacy of the signaling system does not depend on the existence of cheaters or lack thereof, but on whether these mechanisms are robust enough to maintain their reliability.\n\nOther aspects, such as the adaptive character of receivers’ response and the cost of responding to false signals are also relevant for the stability of the signaling system. Again, manipulated photographic images are, and have been, pervasive throughout history. However, in many cases, viewers have learned how to detect them easily, so they are not deceived by them: almost any contemporary viewer is now able to detect most tampered photographs of the early days, and few are misled by some of those which proliferate these days–take the case of the deepfake video falsely depicting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky ordering troops to surrender; most viewers quickly identified the hoax. Even when manipulations are convincing, they are sometimes completely harmless. Very much like the case of the fake flowers mentioned above, the cost of believing the content, or responding to ordinary manipulated photographs where certain objects have been removed for composition purposes, is frequently very low. As others have pointed out (e.g., Harris, 2021), deepfake as well as photographic and video technology, in general, is mostly employed to create harmless images (rather than, say, political scandals), and in many cases, these are so obviously faked that their cost in terms of trust or reliability are almost negligible. And here is where it is relevant to go back to Fallis’ point and put his claims into perspective.\n\n**4. Reconsidering the threat of Deepfakes.**\n\nDon Fallis has claimed that deepfakes and digital technologies of image manipulation are a *serious threat* because they increase the probability of obtaining false positives. In other words, his position is that the efficacy of the signal (videos and photographs) is under serious threat because it is more likely that the proportion of cheaters is, or can be, significantly higher relative to honest signals. Let us look at Fallis’ view in more detail.\n\nFallis’ argument relies on game-theoretic measures of information, and this framework is also standardly used in the context of animal communication, so we think our approach is especially suited to address his view. Yet, to explain his proposal we need some stage-setting. Relying on Skyrms (2010), Fallis assumes a specific way of measuring information: a signal R carries the information that S if and only if the probability of R being the case given S is greater than the probability of R given that S *not* being the case, i. e. P(R|S) &gt; P(R|not-S).\n\nFour features of this analysis are worth stressing. First, information can be false: a state (token) carries ‘misinformation’ iff it carries information about S and S is not the case. Secondly, information comes in degrees; more precisely, a signal R carries more information than a signal Q about S iff the information that R carries about S is greater than the information that Q carries about S, i. e. P(R|S) / P (R|not-S) &gt; P(Q |S) / P(Q | not-S). In connection to this idea, note that the amount of information that a signal carries about a state can change over time. Thirdly, although the information carried by a signal is an objective matter, it depends on the cognitive abilities of the receiver: for instance, from the point of view of a receiver that cannot tell apart signal P from Q, both signals must carry the same amount of information. Finally, Fallis assumes the following epistemological connection between information and evidence: the amount of information carried by a signal R about S corresponds to the *reliability of the evidence* that R carries about S. In other words, the more information a signal carries about a state, the more reliable it is about it.\n\nWith these technical tools, Fallis goes on to argue that the existence of deepfakes jeopardizes the reliability of photographs and videos. To understand his argument, it might be useful to consider a biological analog. Suppose a population of organisms (say, coral snakes), develops a specific signal (e.g., bright colored pigmentation) to signal a specific feature that is relevant to receivers (e.g., venom). This signal carries a great amount of information about the relevant feature and, as a result, it is a reliable source of evidence about danger. Now, suppose that at some point a mimic (say, a milk snake) develops an appearance which closely resembles the signal of the original organism to cause predators to avoid it. If, as a matter of fact, receivers are unable to distinguish the original from the copy (coral from milk snakes), then bright stripes will carry less information about danger than before and, as a result, will be a less reliable indicator. Thus, the introduction of milk snakes decreases the information that bright stripes carry about danger. Even if coral snakes don’t change at all, their appearance becomes less reliable as a signal.\n\nIn a nutshell, Fallis’ argument is that deepfakes might generate a similar kind of process.  Suppose that, before the development of deepfakes, watching a video of a politician committing a crime had a probability of 0.9 of being true. Once deepfakes are around, the very same video has a lower probability of being true, say 0.5. That means that the very same pictorial representation becomes much less reliable when a sufficient number of mimics exist. Videos and photographs have a lower epistemic value, then, because deepfakes increase the probability of cheaters relative to honest signals. Thus, Fallis claims that digital technologies of manipulation (including deepfakes) are a serious threat to the epistemic value of in photographs and videos.\n\nWe agree that the existence of deepfakes reduces the information carried by photographs and videos in the sense explained. To the extent that they do so, they reduce the reliability of videos and photographs and cause some epistemic harm. The question is whether this involves a serious threat, as he affirms, to their epistemic value as a signaling system. We think this is not the case. There are various reasons for resisting this conclusion.\n\nAmong other things, assessing the relevance of the threat of deepfakes depends on how efficient the mechanisms enforced by the system are when it comes to preventing this from happening. In previous sections we applied the tools of animal communication theory to argue that different mechanisms (common interest, handicaps, etc.) sustain the reliability of photographs very much in the same way as they do in the natural world. Our claim is that, in both photography and video, there are sufficiently robust mechanisms which prevent the proliferation of non-veridical, inaccurate, or manipulated images and vouchsafe the reliability of the signaling system. In other words: given the main drive and the general common interest motivating the technological evolution and design of different devices involved in the photographic process—the aim of obtaining images that accurately present the appearance of a real existent objects—and the mechanisms that vouchsafe the reliability of the signal, it is more likely that a photograph produced via this process turns out to be veridical and accurate rather than misleading or inaccurate. Thus, the existence of deepfakes fails to undermine the support that these mechanisms provide to their reliability.\n\nMoreover, even in the unlikely scenario that deepfakes come to equal or outnumber honest images, it might still pay off to trust photographs and videos; if, on average, the cost of believing a deepfake is much lower than the cost of disbelieving an honest image, the rational decision might well be to trust them anyway. For instance, suppose we reach a point at which there are more deepfakes than accurate images, but most fakes are cat-videos depicting cats in funny situations. The rational choice will be to keep trusting photographs and video, even if we end up believing some false claims about cats.  As a result, photographs might still be ‘reliable’ in a broader sense of the term.\n\nTo clarify the argument, note that ‘reliability’ can be understood in different ways. According to a narrow understanding (such as Fallis’), the reliability of R as an indicator of S depends on whether the probability of R given S is greater than the probability of R given that S is not the case. Our first argument is intended to show that Fallis’ challenge fails to show photographs may cease to be reliable in this sense.  However, there is a second, broader interpretation of what it is for a signaling system to be reliable: a signal is reliable if, on average, taking the signal to be true is more beneficial for the receiver than ignoring it. When that happens, the mechanism is reliable enough for the whole signaling system to persist and for receivers to rely on signals. Our second argument shows that, even if deepfakes are very frequent in proportion to honest signals, the signaling system might still be reliable (in this second sense), if the costs of false positives and negatives are taken into account.\n\nTo better illustrate these ideas, Figure 1 represents some of our key arguments. Let’s suppose that (a) captures the current situation, in which some problematic deepfakes are circulating. Assuming that deepfakes proliferate, we can consider three broad kinds of scenarios, (b)-(d). Note that, in all of them, there is a proliferation of false positives and a decrease in the information that images carry about the world, so they all meet Fallis’ conditions. Still, all this is compatible with having various non-threatening scenarios, i.e., scenarios in which the signaling system is robustly reliable. In (c) all the mechanisms we have described (handicaps, common interest, etc.) work well and prevent the massive proliferation of deepfakes. In (d) these mechanisms are not so efficient but responding to deepfakes has a negligible cost. Only a situation like (b) might entail a serious threat to the reliability and the epistemic value of photographs and videos. Whether we are or will be in scenarios (b), (c) or (d) is an empirical question and, since all of them involve information loss, Fallis owes us an argument to convince us that (b) is the scenario we are facing rather than (c) or (d). Indeed, relying on the rich framework of animal communication theory, we provided some positive reasons for thinking that this scenario is unlikely. Consequently, we don’t think deepfakes are a serious threat to the reliability of images.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n*FIG 1*\n\nFinally, we think the comparison with animal communication suggests a different reason to resist Fallis’ pessimistic conclusion. Note that the effectiveness of deepfakes utterly *depends* on the robust reliability of photographs and videos as signaling systems. Deepfakes *parasitize* photographs and videos: if one day photographs stopped being used to indicate the existence of objects and scenes and their overall appearance, because they are not reliable anymore, deepfakes would also vanish. Again, thinking in terms of mimicry might be useful: the milk snake’s red-black-yellow stripes are only useful as long as coral snake’s stripes keep being reliable enough about danger. Mimics cannot be too frequent or too onerous since they are effective only because models are reliable. As a matter of fact, in most cases, evolutionary dynamics will tend to bring the proportion of honest signals and fake ones to a stable equilibrium, in which both coexist with some relative frequency. Thus, although deepfakes might reduce the reliability of photographs, we think it is very unlikely that they will utterly jeopardize their epistemic value. After all, the success of deepfakes depends on this epistemic mark of photographs and videos.\n\n## 5.     Scope of the view\n\nIt is important to note that the scope of our view is limited in three ways. First, as we mentioned before, the mechanisms that vouchsafe the reliability of the signal are limited: they prevent the proliferation of non-veridical photographic images, but they do not guarantee their veridicality. Secondly, the reliability of photographs is a contingent matter both in traditional and in digital photography. The social, cultural, or technological driving forces motivating the design of the mechanisms involved in the photographic process could have been different. But also, they are subject to change in the future. It is possible that the demand for images that capture a life-like and accurate appearance of existing objects ceases to be pressing or is better satisfied by a different technology not continuous with photography or videos. Perhaps the social value of accurate images will stop being a central motivating force for designing photographic devices. It is also possible that the signal ends up losing its efficacy, say, because the technology develops in such a way that it becomes equally easy to produce honest and non-honest signals, so viewers end up reacting to photographs and videos differently. That happens sometimes in the natural world: when mimics proliferate or the signal becomes *too cheap* to fake by other specimens and the rest of mechanisms (common interest, punishing cheaters, etc.) are too weak or nonexistent, then the signal eventually loses its efficacy and receivers learn to ignore it.\n\nHowever, judging from the way photographic technologies are evolving and the persistent social interest in preserving honest signals, there is no reason to believe that these signaling systems are under *any serious threat* even with the existence and proliferation of deepfakes and other digital technologies *.* We already argued that Fallis’ argument that deepfakes reduce the amount of information that videos carry is certainly true but does not do sufficient work to show that the previous claim is false. Our view also puts into question Rini’s pessimistic view. To the extent that the described mechanisms are in place, the existence and limited proliferation of deepfakes need not undermine the epistemic role of photographs. This being so, photographs and videos can still be considered robustly reliable signals of the existence and appearance of objects and scenes of the world, and only a profound change in the mechanisms and social values that sustain this reliability can lead to a pessimistic view. This is an epistemic mark they (contingently, but robustly) still have.\n\n**Of course, deepfakes and deceptive images can be a serious threat for other reasons. Even if the proportion of deepfakes is still negligible compared to honest signals, a single deepfake can be very harmful if, say, it helps to change the opinion of voters in an election or if it seriously harms the reputation of a person or a group of people. Similarly, as Harris (2021) points out, deepfakes might cause certain worrisome associations between cognitive representations. Our account does nothing to argue against these problems; it only works to block specific pessimistic views such as Fallis’ or Rini’s based on the potential loss of epistemic value of images (this is the third limitation of our view).**\n\n**5. Comparison to other views**\n\nSo far, we have provided an account of the epistemic robustness of photography and similar mechanically produced images that (i) construes these systems of information transmission as continuous with other systems found in nature and (ii) allows us to block some skeptical views on the purported threat that deepfakes pose for the epistemic value of photographs and videos. Although our aim is different from other theories which argue for the epistemic value of photographs compared to other pictorial types, some of our arguments incorporate ideas and intuitions that are present in some of these views. To conclude, we will briefly indicate how our view differs from others.\n\nWe’ve claimed that photographs are signals that *typically* and reliably indicate the existence and looks of the depicted objects and scenes, because they are designed to do so, and because there are mechanisms in place that contribute to this being so. The explanation of these mechanisms made partial reference to the mind-independent and automatic processes that photographs very frequently follow. However, unlike traditional causal theories of photography which also appeal to these ideas, we do not claim that an image that is not the product of a purely causal, non-intentional and mind-independent, process is not a (pure or ideal) photograph, nor do we claim that either an image *indicates* the existence of an object, or it is not *really* a (pure/ideal) photograph. In other words, we do not identify the epistemic mark that photographs typically display with a necessary feature that defines the nature of this type of image.\n\nVery much like we do, Robert Hopkins appeals to the design of the photographic mechanism as a guarantee of the accuracy of photographs. However, his view is much stronger than ours. Hopkins claims that in *traditional* photography, when the photographic system follows the norms of proper functioning guiding the design of the mechanism, the resulting photographs are factive or sustain factive pictorial experiences *as a matter of necessity* (Hopkins 2010). We do not think that this is so. On the one hand, it is unclear that non-factive pictures are always the product of a faulty working of the mechanism. Many non-factive photographs are produced using the technique of composition printing but considering this technique a deviation of the rule of proper functioning seems wrong, if only because basic instruction manuals of photography include sections on how to *correctly* perform these techniques, among others, for expressive purposes.\n\nOn the other hand, although it is right to claim that the *overall* goal guiding the design of the photographic mechanism is to obtain accurate appearances of real objects and events, certain elements that can be part of the photographic system are designed with other purposes (see fn.12). In 1927 H.G. Pointing patented a lens attachment that he called ‘variable controllable distortograph’ (Fineman 2012, 105). When used attached to a correctly functioning camera, the proper working of this lens attachment is precisely to deliver distorted photographs. In this case, it seems that everything in the system is working properly and yet, we do not obtain factive seeing-in.\n\nThis points to a more general problem. As we have mentioned, Hopkins claims that when everything works correctly, *traditional* photography *necessarily* delivers factive pictorial experience. With digital photography, he suggests, things might be different partly because we do not know how the mechanism will evolve (Hopkins 2010, 16). But this division between traditional and digital photography with respect to factivity does not seem to be justified. As we mentioned in section 4, we do not know whether in the future there are going to be technologies that alter the current mechanism of analogue or traditional photography as well. As Catharine Abell correctly notes, “the nature of camera designers’ intentions is an empirical matter, not one that can be determined a priori” (2010, 93). The fact that we are now in the era of digital photography does not mean that there cannot be a *revival* of analogue photography that motivates the development of different devices that, by design, prevent photographs from supporting factive pictorial experiences. If this is a possibility, we cannot say that traditional or analogue photography *necessarily* delivers factive pictorial experience. In this sense, we agree with Abell that the epistemic value is a contingent feature of photographs. In fact, the claims we’ve made in this paper are in line and consistent with her view (Abell 2010).\n\nNow, even if our account is weaker than some views, it is also stronger than others. Dominic Lopes, for instance, has claimed that photographs don’t have any special epistemic value as a type of images; the widespread idea that photographs have a distinctive epistemic value, according to him, ultimately relies on the contingent fact that they have been standardly used in knowledge-oriented practices, and the epistemic rules and norms that govern these practices have been imposed on the photographic mechanisms they use (Lopes 2016, 109-111). Moreover, for contingent historical reasons, we have come to associate photography–as a class of images–with a restricted subset of them; therefore, we extrapolate the epistemic value that only a subset of images has over all photographs.\n\nLopes’ view is a reaction against traditional theories of photography which have neglected non-epistemic, artistic, uses of photography and have built “photography’s epistemic power into its very nature” (Lopes 2016, 110) with the ensuing consequence of considering non-veridical photographs (artistic or expressive among them) less pure or non-photographic. This is certainly a mistake, but in reacting against these views, Lopes seems to have thrown the baby out with the bathwater. If traditional theories exaggerate the difference between photographs and other pictorial types, Lopes and his radical version of the *New Theory of Photography* exaggerates the difference between different types of photography.\n\nFirst, artistic, and non-epistemic practices do not use utterly different photographic mechanisms designed following different and less stringent, non-epistemic norms. The design of the photographic mechanism used by practitioners in epistemic and non-epistemic practices alike, *overall* , has responded to a general demand and social pressure to obtain sufficiently accurate, life-like images of real objects or scenes. This doesn’t mean that photographic devices can or should only be used for this purpose. As we’ve claimed, they are not, and this doesn’t necessarily make the resulting images non-photographic. Also, that doesn’t mean either that this general demand and the resulting mechanisms derived from it are necessarily at odds with artistic and expressive practices which should develop different technologies or equipment to serve their needs. Occasionally, this has been the case (remember the *distortograph* ), but artistic and other non-epistemic practices such as family photography, Instagram posting and commercial photography have all exploited, and benefited from, the possibilities, as well as the flexibility, that the standard photographic mechanism affords.\n\nSecondly, it’s not a coincidence that people tend to “treat photographs as having an epistemic virtue” (Lopes 2016, 106). This is not an irrational tendency or an unfounded representativeness heuristic. As we’ve argued, given the drive motivating the technological evolution of the photographic process and the mechanisms that vouchsafe the reliability of the signal, it is (still) more likely that an image produced via this process turns out to be veridical rather than misleading. As contingent as it may be, this is an epistemic feature that characterizes the photographic mechanism itself, and that is precisely why photographs have been standardly used in epistemic practices in the first place, even when other pictorial types can also serve epistemic purposes. Indeed, that is why photographs are instinctively used by amateur reporters when they witness momentous events, and why mobile-phone photographs were so essential to reporting, say, the 2009 Iran elections, the 2011 Japanese Tsunami, and the Arab Spring uprisings (Palmer 2014).\n\nWe agree with Lopes that social norms that are external to the photographic mechanism and that operate in epistemic practices where photographs are used, also contribute to ensure the epistemic stability of the signaling system–indeed, we have considered these norms as part of the mechanism of punishment of cheaters. However, as we have argued, the epistemic robustness of photography is sustained by additional mechanisms that are indeed part and parcel of the photographic mechanism itself.\n\nThis point also shows how our perspective differs from other recent approaches that also resist a pessimistic stance regarding the threat that deepfakes pose to the reliability of certain images. In particular, those who reject a pessimistic stance, tend to base their views on the existence of social norms (prestige, authentication, etc.) which vouchsafe the reliability of images (Harris, 2021; Chalmers, 2022). Unlike these approaches, our focus lies on the technology that underlies the production of photographic images. Our point is that important features involved in the design of these technologies are central to understanding the epistemic robustness of photographs and videos and thereby to rejecting a pessimistic attitude towards the reliability of these images. Even though one of the postulated mechanisms (punishment of cheaters) works most clearly at the social level, the overall reliability of photographic images is sustained by features that are characteristic of the technologies that produce them.\n\n**Bibliography**\n\nAbell, Catharine.
