    "user_content": "## SPENSER'S  POETIC  PHENOMENOLOGY: HUMANISM  AND  THE  RECOVERY  OF  PLACE\n\nThe present paper defends  the thesis  that  Spenser's recovery  of place, as  enacted in The  Faerie  Queene, Book VI,  can  be  linked in  a direct way  to  his  use  of a poetic  phenomenology  which  informs  and  clarifies his  work as  an  epic  writer.  Traditional  humanism is  sometimes  defined as  an  attempt  to  appropriate  the  meaning  of classical  art  and  literature in  terms  of \"timeless\"  philosophical  truths.  Spenser's  originality  as  a Renaissance poet, however, has much to do with his use of literary pro› cedures  that express  but  also  complicate  his  relationship  to  traditional humanism.  While the  heart of Spenser's  \"Book of Courtesy\" enacts  a Neo-Platonic movement from the lower levels of temporal  existence to an  exalted  vision  of spiritual  perfection,  this  same  section  can  be  read along  phenomenological  lines  as  a mysterious  adventure  that embraces self and  other,  personality  and  community,  aesthetics  and  ethics,  in  a sequence of images that opens up a new interpretation of imaginative ful› fillment. 1  The burden of this paper,  therefore,  is  largely concerned with demonstrating how this  poetic sequence instates the  \"truth\" of place in a way  that is  inseparable from  the  meaning of Spenser's humanism. 2\n\nSpenser's celebration of Courtesy  as  a  virtue  involves  an  apprecia› tion  of social  values  as  well  as  a commitment to  transcendent notions of Good.  This peculiar combination cannot be understood apart from  a dialectical appraisal of Spenser's view of nature. This view embraces two extremes. On the one hand, Spenser identifies nature with the principle of  fecundity and abundance. According to this view, which mainly derives from Aristotle, nature is a visible source of human values. In the Garden of Adonis,  for  instance,  nature  emerges  as  a  productive  force  and  a spectacular point of origin (III.vi.42).  On  the  other hand,  Spenser also maintains that nature can function as the invisible source of moral virtue. This more Platonic conception informs his representation of major char› acters, and also influences his critical attitude toward pagan mythology.3\n\nThe difference between these two conceptions of nature can be under› stood  in  terms  of the  tension  that  governs The  Faerie  Queene as a whole. The Aristotelian conception is more closely related to traditional conceptions  of political  authority.  At the  beginning  of Book VI,  for\n\n35\n\nA-T.  Tymieniecka  (ed.),  Analecta Husserliana  XLIV,  35-44. ' 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.\n\ninstance,  courtesy  as  a  virtue  is  associated  with  the  reign  of Queen Elizabeth (Vl.proem 6, line 4). Thus Spenser seems to associate courtesy as  a  virtue  with  the  legitimate  rule  of a contemporary  monarch.  At the end of Book VI,  however,  the idea of pastoral  as  a place of magic  and innocence  reinforces  the  Platonic  conception  of nature,  and  suggests that Spenser does  not wish to  derive  virtue from  either a limited expe› rience of nature or from  basically political  arrangements.\n\nThe idea that virtue can be institutional as well as basic to human com› munities underlines Spenser's epic narrative as a recovery of place which happens in language and ultimately concerns the  movement of the soul toward imaginative fulfillment. 4  In  the introductory  stanzas of his  epic, Spenser  wishes  to  establish  the  connection  between  courtesy  and everyday concerns.  While  courtesy  as  a  virtue  belongs  in  the  hall  of princes,  it is  also  said  to  be  \"the ground, lAnd root  of ciuill  conuersa› tion\"  (VI.i.1,  lines  1-6).  Spenser  indicates  in  this  way  that  courtesy goes beyond specific political interests and penetrates the very language of civilized life.\n\nAn  early  allusion  to  the  meaning  of courtesy  invokes  the  figure  of Calidore, whose \"gracious speach, did steale men's hearts away\" (VI.i.2, line 6). However, Spenser also refers to \"the triall of true curtesie\" where an  ecclesiastical  court  must  pass  sentence  on  a  loveless  Mirabella (Vl.proem.5,  lines  1-2).  The  illusions  of the  world  are  often  mistaken for  ideal  beauty:  \"But vertues  seat is  deepe  within  the  mynd, lAnd not in  outward shows, but inward thoughts defynd\" (Vl.poem.5, lines 8-9). Hence Spenser rejects a narrowly political conception of virtue in order to affirm the importance of subjectivity to moral understanding. Primarily for  this  reason,  I  wish  to contend that the  figure  of Calidore takes  part in  a phenomenological movement toward spiritual insight. s\n\nWhile functioning as  a counter to pure nature and its attendant virtue, Calidore must discover the relationship between the wisdom of humanity and the demands of political life.  Near the beginning of his  adventures, we learn  about the \"innate gifts\"  of Calidore:  his  honesty  and  love  of truth  are  commended (VI.i.3,  line  9).  The  philosophical  basis  for  this combination of talents can be found in Castiglione's Book of  the Courtier. Here Gasparo explains to Ottaviano that certain important virtues cannot be learned: \"but I think that to those who have them they have been given by  nature  and  by  God.,,6  Calidore's  moral  education  within  the  epic context takes  the  form  of a  \"recollection\" of virtue that  allows  him  to partially  overcome the difference between nature  and politics.\n\nUnlike other heroes  in  Spenser's epic,  Calidore is  absent  from  the center of his own text: Calidore disappears at the end of canto ii and does not re-appear prior to  canto  ix. It would  seem that Calepine in  some way  substitutes  for  him  during  the  interim.  As  a  much  less  skillful Calidore,  Calepine tries  to  perform the  function  of the  traditional  hero. However, his presence never ceases to remind us  of Calidore's absence. Because he lacks the manifest qualities of the traditional hero, Calidore's virtue is  credible  and  unobtrusive.\n\nCalidore helps us  see that \"courtesy\" is probably the Spenserian form of Aristotle's  \"near-friendliness\":  it,  too,  properly  belongs  to  the  man who  is  neither  subservient  nor  disagreeable. 7 Occupying  the  mean between two extremes, courtesy thus defined is  a kind of goodwill that enables  us  to  relate  to  everyone in  a like manner:  \"Eunoia or goodwill bears  some  resemblance to  friendship,  but is  not in  fact  friendship,  for we may feel  goodwill towards strangers and persons who are not aware of our feeling  a thing  impossible  between  friends.\"s  However,  while it draws  strangers into its warm embrace, courtesy also might be a pre› condition  for  the  emergence  of more  exalted  forms  of  experience. Aristotle clearly understood the possible connection between the expe› rience of beauty  and  the  attainment of spiritual truth:  \"Nobody falls  in love  who  has  not  been  first  delighted  by  the  sight of beauty,  although it does not follow that a man who is delighted by the beauty of a person is  in  love.,,9\n\nAt the  beginning of Book VI,  we retreat from  the plains,  mountains and rocky coast and enter the wood of Faerie land. The scene of courtesy is  a  pastoral  countryside.  Violence  and  sadness  pervade  this  world  of archaic values:  \"There is  an  older tradition of 'gentilesse'  derived from Provence  and  France,  running  through  medieval  romance  literature, which  had  its  rules  and  casuistry  too,  but expressed  itself chiefly  in actual  example  and  a  pervading  chivalrous  tone.,,10  The  tradition  of courtesy, however, can involve the sudden appearance of various truths. Harry  Berger contends that the repetition  of specific  motifs  structures Book VI as  a whole:  \"The most frequently  repeated  motif is,  signifi› cantly enough, that of a character surprised in a moment of diversion.,,11 All  such  moments  must  be  understood  within  a  moral  context.  For instance,  the  motif of the  interrupted couple occurs twice  (VI.ii.16-17; VI.iii.20-23).  Each  time,  the  discovery  of love  moves  us  closer to  the vision of Mount Acidale. Many scenes of recognition must precede the great unveiling near the end of the Book of Courtesy (VI.x.27-28).\n\nThe  trial  of Mirabella  establishes  the  low  point  in  the  history  of courtesy. It precedes  the  slow  ascent  from  a  discourteous  world.  This entire  movement takes  place in  three  episodes  that  are  represented  by three  different  women:  \"Mirabella projects  the  germinal  form  of frus› tration,  Serena and her Cannibals the germinal form of desire, Pastorella and  her swains the germinal form  of poetic recreation,  all  of which  are infolded and transfigured by  Colin's vision.,,12  The extreme discourtesy of Mirabella results in an ecclesiastical court summons. The glorification of Serena among cannibals is the parody of a religious ceremony. Finally, the  capture  of Pastorella by  Calidore  is  the  prelude  to  the  final  vision of love on Mount Acidale. These three episodes have been said to imitate a Plotinian philosophy of love.  However, they  also might be interpreted as  constituting  a  poetic  phenomenology  whereby  courtesy  is  defined on the  basis  of three  discontinuous  moments.\n\nThe  first  episode  dramatizes  the  pitfalls  of immediate  experience. Rejecting  the  moderate  claims  of courtesy,  Mirabella  uses  her  beauty in  order to  obtain  power over men.  Mira-bella is  literally  the  \"look  of beauty\"  that  enamors  men  and  attempts  to  ruin  them.  The  jury  that presides over her trial  condemns her to  do penance:  tomorrow she must walk the earth and love as  many men as  she formerly  ruined (Vl.vii.37). Mirabella's  suitors  are  feudal  retainers  of Cupid  and  her plea of mercy is  a religious petition. Both of these facts seem to indicate that Mirabella takes  part in  an  ecclesiastical,  rather  than  a  civil,  trial. 13 This  interpre› tation supports the view that love (in the religious sense) is a central issue in  Book  VI. It also  suggests  that  lovelessness  is  the  supreme  discour› tesy  in  Spenser's  phenomenology.\n\nIn  contrast,  the  abduction  of Serena by  cannibals  leads  to  a  basic conflict in  interpretations.  On  the  one  hand,  we  condemn  the  behavior of the cannibals as completely abhorrent. The abduction of Serena is par› ticularly  shocking  insofar  as  it  places  a brutal  practice  in  an  aesthetic perspective. The cannibals who adore Serena eventually raise her \"divine\" body  upon  an  altar of sacrifice  (Vl.viii.42-45).  We  instinctively  reject any  figurative  analogy  between  a  savage  practice  and  civilized  modes of worship.\n\nThis response,  however, could prevent us from coming to terms with the  full  meaning of the episode  as  an  adventure in  Renaissance anthro› pology.  Before  the  festivities  begin,  the  cannibals  must  be  restrained by  a  spiritual  superior:  it  seems  that  \"religion  held  even  theiues  in measure\"  (Vl.viii.43,  line  9).  Spenser's  humanistic  perspective  allows\n\nhim to  imagine  genuine order in  a primitive context.  By  directing  his people  to  the  altar,  this  figure  seems  to  organize  these  forms  into  a social whole. Compared to this event, the love of Mirabella is regressive: her beauty does not \"rise\" but actually \"descends\" into a physical world: \"Spenser's  transition  to  the  cannibal  ring  logically  reduces  the  sophis› ticated evil  to  its  confused origin  and,  in  effect,  allows  him  to  begin all  over again.,,14\n\nIt is  probable  that  Spenser knew  of Montaigne's  famous  essay  on cannibals:  his  anthropological  imagination  seems  to  owe  a great  deal to it.  After discussing the habits of cannibals at  some length, Montaigne integrates  relativism  into  an  argument  against  his  would-be  detractors: \"I  am  not  so  anxious  that  we  should  note  the  horrible  savagery  of these  acts  as  concerned  that,  whilst judging  their  faults  correctly,  we should be so  blind to  our own.,,15  Like Montaigne,  Spenser attempts  to link  anthropological  awareness  to  the  potential  enhancement of moral sensitivity.\n\nHence the \"raising up\"  of Calidore's  Pastorella both  glorifies  nature and  prefigures  its  transformation (Vl.ix.8).  There is  an  irony  in  this  act that becomes evident in retrospect: \"In naming her, the swains reduce her from  an  aristocrat  to  a  shepherdess;  in  worshipping  her,  they  exalt her from  an  aristocrat to  a goddess,  identifying the  symbol  with  the  reality to  which it refers.,,16  Later on,  we  will  discover that this  child of nature is  really  a  high-born  daughter (Vl.xii.20). If the  cannibal  ring  repre› sents  the  lowest  starting-point of human  culture,  then  the  pastoral  ring represents  the  beginning  of an  aesthetic  departure.  The  poetic  qualities of the ring prepare us for the reduced geometry of intellectual beauty and a less  ambiguous  symbolism.\n\nA further  contrast is  implied  in  the  encounter between  Calidore  and Pastorella's protector, old Meliboe. After chasing the Blatant Beast from court  to  country,  Calidore  returns  at  the  beginning  of canto  ix.  His absence from the center of the poem has not gone unobserved. It created a  moral  vacuum  that  his  return  promises  to  fill.  In  his  encounter  with Meliboe,  however,  Calidore  merge  as  the  typical  heroic  protagonist. While  visiting  Meliboe's  peasant lodging,  Calidore  expresses  envy  for the life of rural simplicity (Vl.ix.19). An \"entraunced\" Calidore momen› tarily  rejects  his  political  vocation  as  he  speaks  to  the  wise  recluse (Vl.ix.27-28).  But Meliboe  will  have none  of this,  and  refuses  to  view political  life  as  an  external  achievement: \"It is  the  mynd,  that  maketh good or ill,\" he tells Calidore (Vl.ix.30, line 1). Spenser presents Meliboe\n\nas  a  relative  contrast to  the  more  worldly  Calidore:  \"Boethian  stoicism was not Spenser's whole card; but neither was there any reason to doubt that  he  meant  Meliboe's'  'sensible  words'  (Vl.ix.26)  as  the  expression of one facet  of an  acceptable  attitude.,,17\n\nPrior to  the  vision  on  Mount  Acidale,  Calidore  fails  to  understand the unity of real  and ideal worlds. 18  Traditionally, the figure of Calidore is  associated with the name of Sir Philip Sidney. This identification lies at the basis of our optimism with respect to Calidore's future.  Calidore is  a man of the world whose natural gifts lift him above common ambi› tions.  As  the  exemplar  of courtesy,  he  must  mingle  with  others  and advance  the  cause  of virtue.  But  his  idealism  derives  from  an  ideal court,  rather  than  from  a  purely  political  one:  \"In  Book  VI  diplomacy is  less  a technique than a symbol, and Spenser does not show Calidore's exquisite  tact  simply  in  order  to  make  him  more  convincing  as  a Renaissance  courtier.,,19  Hence  the  \"fulfillment\"  of political  service requires  a  poetic  vision  of the  supernatural.  Nature  is  less  resourceful than  the  most  truthful  poets:  \"Her world  is  brazen,  the  poets  deliver  a golden.\"zo\n\nIn  Spenser's  epic,  therefore,  the  return  to  pastoral  culminates  in  the overcoming of nature as an external obstacle. Our first glimpse of Venus is  significant  in  this  respect:  her  place  appears  to  exclude  nature  in  its grosser aspects (Vl.x.7, lines  1-5). It is  here that Calidore has his  vision of the hundred dancing maidens (Vl.x.ll, lines 6-9). Three Graces appear in  the  center of a ring  and  circle  a  solitary  figure,  who  wears  a  rose garland. Because her beauty surpasses that of all the others,  she is  \"that faire  one/ That in  the  midst was  placed parauaunt\" (Vl.x.15,  lines 6-7). We  learn  from  the  narrator that  this  mysterious  figure  is  Colin  Clout's lost love: \"Thy loue is there aduaunst to be another Grace\" (Vl.x.16, lines 8-9). In  a  moment,  this  whole apparition  suddenly  vanishes.\n\nThe  rough  shepherd  who  has  played his  pipe  in  a  fit  of anger  then proceeds to offer his intruder an  interpretation of the vision  as  a whole. It is  what  we  learn  about  the  central  figure  that  primarily  interests  us. At first  glance,  she  is  \"but a countrey  lasse, /Yet  she  all  other countrey lasses farre  did  pass\"  (Vl.x.25,  lines  8-9).  Her  pre-eminent beauty  dis› tinguishes her from all other women. From another standpoint, however, she  seems  to  condense  or  contain  the  qualities  of  her  companions (Vl.x.27,  lines  1-3).  No  longer  a country  maiden,  she  finally  becomes \"Great Gloriana, greatest maiesry\" (Vl.x.28, line 3). Reconciled in spirit to  the  virtue  of  his  Queen,  Calidore  can  now  return  to  his  beloved\n\nPastorella.  The  thrust of what he  sees  points  toward  a  vast  firmament: \"For a  moment the beloved is  poised  alone  in  a  visionary  splendor;  in the next moment she recedes to make room for Gloriana though, with the words,  'Sunne of the world,'  the two Ideas make brief contact.,,21\n\nThe  vision  on  Mount  Acidale  reveals  Spenser's  indebtedness  to traditional  iconography.  Although  he  may  not have  actually  known  of Botticelli's  \"Primavera,\" Spenser works  with  the  same  principles  that govern this composition. For instance, the painting shows Venus standing between  two  groups  of maidens:  one group  produces  an  earthly  Flora; but  the  other  group  contains  a  lovely  Castitas,  who  turns  toward  a heavenly  Mercury.  Taken  as  a  whole,  this  entire  sequence  (or  action) reproduces  the  basic  structure of Plotinian  spirituality.22  The  separate moments of this sequence only become \"simultaneous\" within the sphere of the canvas.\n\nAs  a  poet,  Spenser  reproduces  the  same  movement  by  means  of language. In the uncertain identity of  the central figure on Mount Acidale, we discern the flickering visage of an earthly maiden or a celestial Queen. The rhythm of the poem intensifies from one stanza to the next:  beauty that  can  only  exist in  time haunts  us  as  it turns  into  silence.  Calidore patiently  listens,  but  he  cannot  separate himself from  what he  hears: his chivalrous mission may have led him to discover an  actual Gloriana, but it  also  suggests  that ideal  beauty  must transcend the  limitations  of space  and time.  Unlike the piping  shepherd,  Colin Clout,  with  whom the identity of the poet at last ceases to be confused, Calidore must live in the tension between ideals and their fulfillment. This tension commits him,  in  advance,  to  a  future  life of concrete  acts  and  the  company  of historical  persons.  As  he leaves  his  pastoral  setting,  Calidore prepares to  perform his  remaining duties.\n\nI  would  like  to  conclude  this  discussion  by  restating  my  position concerning the relevance of phenomenology to Spenser's work as an epic poet.  On  the  one hand,  what I  have  chosen  to  call  Spenser's  \"poetic phenomenology\"  at least suggests  that the traditional  interpretation of this philosophical sources might be considered from a phenomenological standpoint.  At the  beginning of this  paper,  I  alluded  to  the  role  that both Aristotle and Plato might have had in developing Spenser's concept of virtue.  Within  the  course  of the  paper,  however,  I  presented  the goal of the Book of Courtesy in  terms  of a poetic  phenomenology that helps  situate  the  recovery  of place  within  a  narrative  context.  This goal  is  inseparable  from  the  mission  of Calidore himself as  a  typical\n\nrepresentative  of Renaissance  conceptions  of virtue  and  political  edu› cation.  At  the  same  time,  it  cannot  be  identified  too  closely  with Calidore's  personal  function  in  the  epic  narrative.\n\nThe  recovery  of  place  involves  a  slow  spiritual  awakening  that embraces  the  lowest  levels  of erotic  awareness  as  well  as  the  highest reaches  of \"ideal\" experience.  While  this  phenomenological  progres› sion requires  social interaction, it also assumes the form of a subjective adventure that does not completely coincide with the actions of any single character.  At the end of Spenser's epic, therefore,  the  recovery of place becomes a sublime metaphor whose deeper meaning is corroborated by tradition  and  phenomenology alike:  \"But what do  I bid you  love in  the soul? the  beauty  of the  soul.  The  beauty  of bodies  is  a  visible  light, the  beauty  of the  soul  is  an  invisible  light;  the  light  of the  soul  is truth.'023\n\n## NOTES\n\n- 1 In  this  paper,  I  do  not  limit  the  meaning  of phenomenology  to  the  work  of  its founder,  or  to  any  single  phase  of its  long  development.  Nevertheless,  I  derive  the concept of \"imaginative fulfillment\"  from  Husserl's  attempt to  describe the  experience of truth  on  a  phenomenological  basis.  I  believe  that this  concept  can  be  related  to  a broad range of human activities.\n- 2 While  the  sense  of place  that relates  to  poetry  may  not coincide  with  truth,  it  opens up  a world in  which truth can occur. In Being and Time, Heidegger explores the concept of world  as  a  phenomenological  alternative  to  Cartesian  dualism.  His  late  writings on  art  and  language  demonstrate how this  concept can  be  linked  to  place  as  a  poetic concern.\n- 3 For instance,  while FQ II.xii  abounds  in  classical references,  Spenser inverts  a facile naturalism in  his  use  of ancient sources.  Guyon  resembles  Odysseus  in  his  voyage  into the Bower of Bliss, but he also shows  how  the rejection of artifice can parallel the affir› mation of natural  abundance as  an  ethically  mediated  value.\n- 4 By emphasizing the role of language in the recovery  of place,  I  leave open  the  issue of whether or not interpretation  must be onto  logically  grounded.  On  the  other hand,  I contend  that imaginative  fulfillment  is  already  a  \"linguistic\"  phenomenon on  the  most primordial  level.  Hence  my  use of phenomenology  is  especially  suited for  the examina› tion of literature.\n- S The claim that Calidore takes part in a phenomenological movement toward truth should not be confused with the identification of Calidore with an imputed narrative subject. While subjectivity  plays  a crucial role in  Spenser's  epic  as  a  whole,  Calidore  himself is  by  no means the  narrative \"center\" of Courtesy.\n- 6 Baldesar Castiglione, The  Book of the  Courtier, Book IV,  sec.
