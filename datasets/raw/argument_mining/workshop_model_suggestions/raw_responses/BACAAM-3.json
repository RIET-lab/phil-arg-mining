Kant's Taxonomy of the Principles of Morality\n\nThe idea of autonomy of the will emerges in Kant's moral philosophy as the solution to a crucial issue that Kant considers unsolved by previous moral philosophers: the question of the status and the foundations of moral obligation (cf. 2:298). The account first presented in  the Groundwork must  be  interpreted  with  regard  to  Kant's  diagnosis  of  the  state  of  the discussion to which he aimed to contribute. His examination of the previous views does not provide a mere background, but instead represents a momentous aspect of the development of Kant's own account. A close connection between Kant's thesis of the autonomy of the will and  the  assessment  of  the  previous  accounts  of  morality  is  clearly  suggested  both  in  the Groundwork and the second Critique , where critical remarks on previous views immediately follow the presentation of the idea of autonomy. Kant's notion of autonomy provides a new vantage  point  from  which  the  shortcomings  of  the  previous  views  are  better  seen.  Kant accordingly rejects all previous views on the charge of heteronomy (cf. GMS 4:441, KpV 5:33, 29:629).\n\nKant's remarks in the Groundwork and the second Critique on previous moral principles derive from the thorough appraisal that can be followed in earlier unpublished texts. Many of Kant's private notes and, more extensively, each version of his lectures on ethics discuss the  relevant  viewpoints  on  the  foundations  of  morals.  While  the  terminological  contrast between autonomy and heteronomy is still absent from the notes and the lectures prior to\n\nthe Groundwork and  emerges  only  later,  in  the  Mrongovius  II  notes  (cf.  29:629),   Kant's 1 criticisms  prior  to  1785,  show  how  that  contrast  emerged.  Before  Kant  put  the  previous views together as heteronomous views, he addressed them with specific criticisms, which, unlike the all-inclusive heteronomy objection, reveal specific weaknesses of each view and, more importantly, how those views include insights that proved helpful in the development of  Kant's  mature  conception.  His  discussion  of  the  previous  views  is  extraordinarily valuable  for  understanding  the  idea  of  autonomy  not  only  because  it  sheds  light  on  his desiderata for a solution to the central issue of moral philosophy, but also because it clarifies how Kant's idea of autonomy relates to earlier views. As I shall argue, Kant's examination of rationalist views directly contributes to the development of his view of the autonomy of the will.\n\nBefore addressing this issue, however, the general character of Kant's critical remarks on the previous views must be briefly explained. In the lectures, Kant's examination of the previous accounts mainly occurs in the section 'On the Supreme Principle of Morality', and, occasionally, in the section 'On Law'.  Remarkably, those discussions belong to the very few 2 parts  of  the  lectures  that  do  not  directly  correspond  to  Baumgarten's  textbooks  Kant comments on. The whole section 'On the Supreme Principle of Morality', which prima facie appears an unexpected duplication of the previous section 'On the Principle of Morality', is an addition of Kant's to Baumgarten's order, which Kant closely follows in the rest of the lectures.  The insertion of a specific section in the schedule of the lectures, however, must not 3 have been primarily motivated by the aim of supplementing the textbook with a historical summary.   While  Kant's  logic  and  metaphysics  lectures  have  sections  dedicated  to  fairly 4\n\n1  On the special significance of the Mrongovius II notes see Timmermann 2015.\n\n2   Cf.  27:9f;  27:135-7;  27:274-8;  Kaehler 55-73; 29:620f. I shall mainly focus on the lecture notes up to 1785, relevant to the development of the idea of autonomy. The later Vigilantius notes briefly rehearse the same arguments as the earlier lectures (27:497-9).\n\n3  See Reich 2001, 387. As Reich observes, the title 'Of the supreme principle of morality' anticipates Kant's phrasing of the aim of the Groundwork :  'the  identification and corroboration of the supreme principle of morality' (4:392). On the relation between Kant's ethics lectures to Baumgarten's works see Bacin 2015.\n\n4   Wood 2015: 124, stresses that Kant's remarks on previous moral theories sketch a brief 'history of ethics', though 'not in the narrative-chronological sense, but in the taxonomical sense'.\n\ncomprehensive historical sketches, the remarks on previous moral theories are particularly selective.  Kant  only  mentions  a  few  selected  views,  often  without  even  naming  their advocates, and does not present them as stages of a continuous development. Instead, his critical remarks concentrate on the modern views, which propose solutions to the question of moral obligation. While Kant's comments did provide his students with some background on the history of the discipline, their main aim was to map the relevant conceptions of the principle  of  morality.  This  purpose  explains  why  analogous  remarks  on  heteronomous theories  occur  in  the Groundwork and  the  second Critique ,  where  a  genuinely  historical summary of the conceptions of morality would have been out of place.  Thus, the evidence 5 suggests that the discussion of the previous principles is directly significant for how Kant develops his own position.\n\nKant  organizes  his  examination  according  to  a  taxonomy  that,  remarkably,  did  not change significantly through the decades. Kant first separates ancient views, which he takes to be focused on determining the contents of virtue and the highest good, and then modern views, which he presents as primarily concerned with the principle of morality, or what he calls  the  'sources  and  principles  of  moral  evaluation'  (27:106;  cf.  e.g.  Refl.  6760,  19:151). 6 Focusing on modern views, he then distinguishes between empirical and rationalist views: the  former  propose  principles  that  can  only  be  cognized  empirically,  while  the  latter  put forward principles that require rational cognition. This distinction may appear in contrast with the heteronomy objection presented in the works of the 1780s, since all heteronomous principles ultimately are empirically conditioned, as they presuppose a contingent interest in some object (see e.g. Cohen 2014: 163). The charge of heteronomy, however, does not revoke the difference between empirical and rational principles, which Kant notably still used after introducing the heteronomy objection (see 5:41). The merely descriptive distinction between empiricist and rationalist views points at a fundamental difference in moral epistemology and ontology without anticipating any objection. The views that Kant calls rationalist remain so, even if the heteronomy objection applies to them, as long as they maintain that the moral\n\n5   On  the  various  'histories  of  morality'  in  Germany  prior  to  Kant  see  Hochstrasser  2004  (where, unfortunately, the remarks on Kant's own approach are insufficient; see Hochstrasser 2004: 201f).\n\n6  The distinction is put in stronger terms in the Mrongovius II notes, where the key issue of modern views is: 'On what, then, does morality rest?' (29:620). Cf. Kaehler 20.\n\nstandard builds on something  that cannot be cognized  within experience, such as metaphysical perfection or the perfect will.\n\nMy examination shall focus on Kant's comments on the views that he calls 'rationalist', which prove to be closely connected with the development of the idea of autonomy.  Kant's 7 treatment of the rationalist views is especially worth examining also because in the earlier published writings, such as the Distinctness essay of 1762/64, his remarks seem to privilege the  sentimentalist  views,  apparently  neglecting  the  'rationalists'.  Disregarding  the  role  of Kant's discussion with the 'rationalists', however, amounts to ignoring a crucial aspect of the emergence of the idea of autonomy. The lecture notes, along with Kant's private notes, thus provide a highly valuable supplement to the published writings also in this regard.\n\nBefore  examining  Kant's  criticisms  of  rationalist  accounts  a  last  clarification  on  his taxonomy  is  needed.  Kant  applies  a  further  distinction  between  'external'  and  'internal' principles  to  both  empiricist  and  rationalist  views.  This  difference  does  not  concern  the subject  and  its  relation  to  the  action,  as  is  generally  assumed.   What  is  at  issue,  is  not 8 whether the ground of moral demands is internal to moral subjects, but what is a proper account  of  the  principle  that  determines  the  moral  worth  of  actions.  In  fact,  Kant  here distinguishes between opposing conceptions of the moral quality of actions, which can be understood as internal or external to the action itself (see e.g. 27:109, 27:120). Kant draws on the distinction between moralitas objectiva sive interna and subjectiva sive externa .  The former designates the inner worth of an action, understood as an intrinsic property of the action, while the latter is the worth of an action depending on a commanding subject's will.  Like 9 his  contemporaries,  Kant  distinguishes  between  views  that  centre  on  'inner  morality\n\n7  Here I cannot examine to what extent Kant adequately represents the views he discusses. For a brief overview of most of them and references to further literature, see Bacin 2017a. On Kant's remarks on the 'empiricist' views see Georg Mohr's chapter.\n\n8  See e.g. Schneewind 2009: 145; Kerstein 2002: 142. According to Wood 2015: 124, 'inner' here means 'arising from our own will', which cannot apply to the perfectionist view as Kant construes it. Wood accordingly understands the principle of education as inner, while Kant considers it as external (see Wood 2015: 124 and 29:621).\n\n9  See Baumgarten 1760: § 36 and 82; Meier 1764: § 51, 103f: 'Internal morality has its sufficient ground primarily in the very quality of the action itself and in the nature of that person who performs it. […] External morality of a free action is that which has its sufficient ground primarily in the free will of a person'. Cf. Wolff 1733: § 137, 392f and the definitions in Meissner 1737: 388.\n\n[arising] from the nature of the action' and views that argue for 'external [morality], from duty towards commands' (Refl. 6480, 19:21). A principle is external if it construes morality as having its ground 'outside the nature of action, lying in the will of another' (Refl. 6754, 19:149).  On  the  other  hand,  an  internal  principle  construes  morality  as  belonging  to  the action, without depending on the imposition of any will. Thus, in the rationalist camp, the perfectionist  view  chiefly  represented  by  Wolff  (cf.  29:626)  is  not  described  as  internal because it would maintain that the source of morality is internal to the agent, as it might seem. This reading would not even match Wolff's position, which does not make morality depend on any function of the subjects. Kant regards the principle of perfection as 'internal', instead, because it holds that the moral quality of actions is objective and intrinsically bound to essential features of the actions themselves.  Analogously, the theological view championed  by  Crusius  is  construed  as  'external'  (cf.  29:627)  because  it  claims  that  the moral  worth  of  actions  depends  on  an  external  act  of  God's  will.  Therefore  Kant  gives  a rather traditional description, which arguably means to be uncontroversial.\n\nKant's distinction between  empiricist and rationalist views thus include in 'rationalism' principles that we would now call voluntaristic, as opposed to rationalist, as is still apparent in the Groundwork (4:443) and the second Critique (5:39). 10   This is remarkable, because voluntarist and rationalist accounts of morality conflicted at least since Cudworth's criticism  of  Hobbes  (see  e.g.  Schneewind  2010).  Kant  nevertheless  presents  as  rationalist* both the perfectionist and the theological views. 11  He justifies the inclusive description of the rationalist* camp referring to the idea of perfection as a unifying feature, maintaining that all the views falling in the rationalist* camp ultimately build on some idea of perfection. While this clearly holds for the perfectionist conception, the claim that the theological principle is centered on the idea of 'a most perfect will' (29:627, cf. 5:41) entails that the divine will can be  cognized  only  through  reason,  just  like  any  notion  of  perfection.  The  theological  view belongs to the rationalist* camp because it presupposes that God's will is 'known through\n\n10  To prevent misunderstandings, I will hereafter use 'rationalism*' for what Kant calls 'rationalism' or 'intellectualism', and 'rationalism' for the current, narrower sense of the term.\n\n11   Kant  sometimes  also  mentions  a  'principle  of  truth',  which  he  rather  oddly  attributes  to Cumberland  (cf.  27:121,  29:622).  In  a  private  note  Kant  even  leaves  a  blank  for  the  name  of  its advocate: cf. Refl. 6624, 19:116, and the editors' note. Kant must have meant Wollaston's view. See also Wood 2015: 125.\n\nreason,  and  not  positively'  (27:510).  Thereby  Kant  rules  out  from  the  beginning  simpler versions of divine command  theories, which are centered on the thought of the unconditioned sovereign power of God as entailing the capacity to reward and punish here and in the afterlife. According to Kant, such accounts should not be regarded as rationalist*, since God's will would not be the object of a rational cognition, but rather of an empirical attitude  of  fear,  submission,  or  gratitude  resulting  from  a  contingent  positive  act.  Kant's selective  understanding  of  the  theological  paradigm  is  neither  artificial  nor  motivated  by mere  taxonomical  reasons.  On  the  contrary,  it  focuses  the  examination  of  the  theological account from the outset on the necessary connection of a divine command view with the intrinsic perfection of God's will, thereby highlighting what emerges as its crucial feature.\n\nWhile Kant's charts of the rationalist* accounts of morality include a voluntarist view like the theological conception, they do not mention prominent rationalist views like Samuel Clarke's or Richard Price's. While he may or may not have known of Price's views since the Review of the Principal Questions of Morals was never translated into German, French, or Latin, Kant must have known something of, or about, Clarke or Cudworth. 12  Since the aim of these remarks is not to provide an exhaustive map of the current views, however, the absence of some names does not entail that the criticisms are not meant to apply to further writers as well. Kant might arguably have understood those rationalist views as further instances of the principle of (metaphysical) perfection. 13\n\n## 2. The Arguments against the Principle of Perfection\n\nKant's remarks against the perfectionist view of morality can be summed up in two main points, which are often repeated both in the lectures and in Kant's notes.\n\nA  first criticism against the principle of perfection, which  can be called the Contingency argument, points out that because human perfection is contingent, it  cannot provide any normative self-standing criterion: 'Solely from the fact that it is in accordance\n\n12  Clarke's main works were available in German translation in Kant's times: see Clarke 1756, which includes both cycles of Boyle lectures. On Cudworth see footnote 26. Interestingly, Kant's moral view was early compared to Price's and Cudworth's: see e.g. Meiners 1801: 85-9 and Stäudlin 1822: 961.\n\n13  For a different suggestion see Wood 2015: 125.\n\nwith our nature, it is not perfection merely, for I can have a better nature, e.g. angel' (27:6; cf. 27:62). This objection is especially relevant in the first phase of Kant's moral thought, in the mid-1760s,  when  he  supposes  that  the  perfectionist  views  could  be  supplemented  with  a thorough  examination  of  human  nature:  ' Hence the  supreme  law  of  morality  is:  act according to your moral nature' (27:6). The opposition between possible perfection and real perfection  points  out  the  risk  that  ethics  be  merely  'chimerical',  that  is,  unable  to  make demands that can be enacted. This is one important reason why Kant, in the earlier phase of his practical philosophy, suspects that reason cannot be the only faculty of moral cognition since it cognizes perfections higher than what human beings can possibly achieve (cf. 27:62).\n\nKant's  second  main  criticism  against  the  principle  of  perfection  can  be  called  the Emptiness objection (cf. 27:16, 29:627; Refl. 6754, 19:149). Prescriptions like 'do good' ( fac bonum ) or 'perfect yourself' ( perfice te ), which Wolffian perfectionism presents as the highest moral rules, are nothing but tautologies expressing the prescriptive meaning of moral terms ('good',  'perfect'),  and  do  not  determine  any  specific  duties  (see  Bacin  2006:  86).  Kant's observation  concerning  ' fac  bonum '  applies  to  the  command  of  perfection  as  well:  'there ought  to  have  been  another  rule,  to  tell  us  what  moral  goodness  [or  moral  perfection] consists in' (27:264). 14   Kant argues that the notion of perfection is empty, and thus cannot have any practical significance because it merely results by abstraction from actual cases of moral pleasure: 'the general concept of perfection is not comprehensible through itself, and from it no practical judgments can be supplied; rather it is itself more a derived concept in which that which occurs in particular cases is given the general name 'perfect'' (Refl. 6624, 19:116;  cf.  Refl.  6634,  19:120).  This  objection  is  sometimes  connected  with  the  hint  at  a positive project, which follows from the thought that the notion of perfection can determine a  proper  moral  principle  once  it  is  made  more  specific.  Therefore,  Kant  proposes  a distinction between moral and pragmatic perfection (cf. 27:130). If the former is construed as the perfection of the will, then 'perfice te' can indeed be considered as a moral principle, as he once suggests, anticipating the Doctrine of Virtue . 15\n\n14  Guyer 2007: 306, argues that the many pages that Wolff devotes to the duties to oneself in his ethical works belie Kant's charge of tautology. Those detailed remarks, however, show not that commanding perfection can determine the contents of moral demands, but only that a number of moral demands can be presented as instances of the general demand of greater perfection.\n\n15  Cf. 27:265. Guyer 2011 has pressed this point.\n\nWith regard to the philosophical debates of Kant's times, he notably never embraces more  malicious  criticisms  like  Johann  Joachim  Lange's  Thomasian  point  that  suggests Wolff's perfection is nothing but a metaphysical name for self-love and egoism. In fact, Kant already presupposes Baumgarten's distinction between perfection as a means and perfection as an end, meant as a response to that objection (see Schwaiger 2011: 135). When Kant comes closest to such an objection, is when he observes, not that the Wolffian principle is inherently non-moral, but that because of its vagueness it fails to determine a moral criterion, which amounts to the charge of emptiness. 16\n\n## 3. The Arguments against the Theological View\n\nKant's  criticisms  of  the  theological  view  are  more  extensive  and  differentiated  than those  directed  against  the  principle  of  perfection.  They  narrow  down  to  four  main objections.\n\nFirst, Kant argues that a theological account of morality inevitably leads to Arbitrariness  and  Contingency. According  to  this  objection,  if  we  understand  morality  as issued  by  God's  will,  as  the  theological  accounts  maintain,  we  thereby  make  morality contingent, which it cannot be. On this view, the moral laws become ' statuta ', i.e. positive laws (e.g. 29:627). On the contrary, Kant holds that it is an essential feature of moral norms to have the validity of 'natural laws', as opposed to positive laws. For him, the advocate of a theological view 'regards natural laws as statuta of the divine will, but they are norms that lie  from  eternity  in  the  nature  of  the  thing'  (27:173;  cf.  27:546).  The  standard  of  morality cannot  be  freely  determined  by  an  author  of  the  law,  contrarily  to  what  a  theological voluntarism would entail (cf. 27:136, 29:633f). Kant repeats this argument often, mostly in\n\nCf. 27:264: 'the statement Fac bonum et omitte malum can be no moral principle for obligation, for the 16 good  can  be  good  in  a  variety  of  ways  for  any  given  purpose,  since  it  is  a  principle  of  skill  and prudence;  only  if  it  is  good  for  moral  actions  would  it  then  be  a  moral  principle.  It  is  therefore  a principium vagum '. The same point is still made in the later Vigilantius notes: cf. 27:517.\n\nconnection with the distinction between author of the law and author of the obligation, i.e. legislator. 17\n\nThe Contingency argument, however, is not an original criticism. Leibniz, for instance, had made the same point against Pufendorf, arguing that 'no one will maintain that justice and goodness originate in the divine will, without maintaining that truth originates in it as well:  an  unheard-of  paradox'.  On  the  contrary,  Leibniz  maintained  that  'justice  follows certain  rules  of  equality  and  of  proportion  no  less  founded  in  the  immutable  nature  of things, and in the divine ideas, than are the principles of arithmetic and of geometry'. 18  But Cudworth had also criticized voluntarism along the same lines (see Cudworth 1731: § II.1-2, 16f). The Contingency objection thus appears to be the most straightforward for Kant, since it follows from the assumption that moral norms must be necessary rather than contingent and are to be understood as 'natural laws', i.e. as non-positive normative principles. Yet, this  is  remarkably  the  only  objection  against  the  theological  principle  that  Kant  does  not mention in the Groundwork .\n\nSecondly, Kant claims that the theological principle needs to presuppose the validity of moral standards prior to God's lawgiving (Goodness and Divine Goodness). However, if a notion of goodness is necessary to acknowledge God's act as good, that notion cannot derive from  God's  act  itself.  Already  the  Herder  notes  report  Kant  wondering:  'Can  we,  even without presupposing God's existence and His arbitrium , derive all obligations from within? Responsio : not merely in the affirmative, for this, rather, is ex natura rei , and we conclude from this  to  God's  choice'  (27:9).  If  that  necessary  assumption  is  not  made,  it  is  impossible  to recognize  the  perfection  of  God's  will  (cf.  19:35:  'If  one  wants  to  cognize  God  prior  to morality, one ascribes to him no moral perfections'). This suggests that we can know God's will  only  through  the  moral  laws  (27:135f),  or  'from  the  nature  of  good  actions'  (27:109). This objection corresponds to the first remark on the theological account in the Groundwork\n\n17  See 19:131; 19:156; 27:247, 283; 27:1433; 27:544f; Kaehler, 79. On the distinction see Kain 2004, Reath 2013b: 37-40.\n\n18  Leibniz 1706: 71; cf. Leibniz 1710: 34f, 398f. Remarkably, Kant never directly discusses the possible reply that addresses the assumption that God's commands are arbitrary. Kant seems never to dispute that 'the faculty of choice does not  determine  [ constituiret ] anything  but what  is in itself contingent' (27:147). Barbeyrac had challenged precisely this assumption to defend Pufendorf against Leibniz (cf. Barbeyrac 1735: 415).\n\n('[…]  merely  because  we  cannot  intuit  its  perfection  but  can  derive  it  from  our  concepts alone,  the  foremost  of  which  is  that  of  morality':  4:443). 19   Leibniz,  however,  had  already argued this point against Pufendorf: 'One must pay attention to this fact: that God is praised because he is just. There must be, then, a certain justice - or rather a supreme justice - in God, even though no one is superior to him' (Leibniz 1706: 71).\n\nA third remark pinpoints the epistemic uncertainty that affects the theological view, as it entails the requirement of revelation. If the 'theological moralists' do not hold that God's will can be cognized through purely rational moral notions, then they must appeal to some sort  of  revelation.  But  such  kind  of  cognition  of  the  divine  will  cannot  be  a  necessary enabling condition of complying with moral demands (cf. e.g. 20:112, 29:627). Kant thereby reverses a point of Crusius', who had claimed that referring to God's will would account for the  possibility  of  cognizing  what  morality  demands  without  presupposing  any  further knowledge. 20\n\nA  fourth  critical  remark,  closely  connected  to  the  Goodness  objection,  concerns  the justification  of  God's  moral  authority  (Unjustified Authority).  If  God's  commands  are  not grounded on any antecedent foundations, then their authority only builds on his power to impose sanctions on his subjects, just like any human sovereign. If God's authority in issuing commands is not justified, then the only ground of such commands would be power, much like  in  the  case  of  a  tyranny.  But  this  would  make  moral  demands  merely  pragmatic  (see 29:627). Since any  relevant distinction between  theological and  political variants of voluntarism  disappear,  the  same  objection  applies.  This  corresponds  to  Kant's  second remark against theological views in the Groundwork . 21  Again, Cudworth had made the same\n\n19  This objection is still present in the later Vigilantius notes: cf. 27:498.\n\nSee Crusius 1744: § 135 (trans. Schneewind): 'coming to know God and his will through proofs, and 20 judging what is told us by means of clear arguments, is for most people much too roundabout. Most scholars do not get far in doing so, and [so] how could the unlearned get things completely right? But because all men are subordinated to the divine law and will be judged by it hereafter, it is easy to infer that God would create a shorter path to knowledge of it and would make his will evident in such a way that it could come to everyone's knowledge.'\n\n21  Cf. GMS 4:443: 'but because if we do not do this [i.e., if we do not derive our conception of God's will from our moral concepts] [...], the concept of His will still left to us - taken from the attributes of desire for honor and dominion, combined with horrendous representations of power and the zeal for vengeance - would have to be the foundation for a system of morals directly opposed to morality'.\n\nobjection and Leibniz had used it against Pufendorf: 'If the source of the law is the will of a superior and, inversely, a justifying cause of law is necessary in order to have a superior, a circle is created, than which none was ever more manifest'. 22   Since the fear of punishment cannot  be  the  foundation  of  morality,  Kant  argues  that  God's  act  of  will  presupposes  an obligation that is already in place (27:9).\n\nA theological view prone to the Unjustified Authority objection, however, could hardly be regarded as rationalist* since the appeal to some perfection is here lacking. Accordingly, the cognition of moral demands cannot be considered rational. In fact, all of Kant's remarks against  the  theological  account  ultimately  press  this  very  point,  that  is,  the  necessary connection  between  the  divine  will  and  perfection,  which  is  already  emphasized  in regarding that view as rationalist*. If God's will is to be regarded as the perfect will, it must never make an arbitrary choice (objection 1) because it operates according to the criterion provided  by  an  inherent,  independent  goodness  (objection  2).  Therefore  its  workings  are fully intelligible to every rational being without any revelation (objection 3) and its authority is justified by the intrinsic connection with the perfect goodness (objection 4). All objections imply  that  the  theological  view  is  erroneous  insofar  as  it  turns  out  to  be  an  empirical account,  namely  as  it  builds  on  conditions  that,  unlike  an  idea  of  perfection,  are  only empirically cognisable. 23\n\n## 4. A Rationalist's Critique of Rationalism\n\nKant's objections against rationalism*, however, lack remarks on the conception(s) of reason  advocated  by  the  writers  considered,  or  implicit  in  their  views.  No  specific conception of reason comes into play, nor are the features of the reason that Kant is talking about in labelling these principles 'rational' ever discussed. 24  This does not appear to be the\n\n22  Leibniz 1706: 73 (cf. 73-5). Cf. Cudworth 1731: § II.3, 19.\n\n23  See the later Vigilantius notes: 'if the ground of duty is posited in the divine will, it is either drawn from metaphysics, namely [from the] theologia naturalis ,  insofar as the divine will is known through reason, or else derived from theologia revelata , and in that case it is empirical' (27:538).\n\n24  See e.g. Guyer 2007 and 2011, where he argues that Kant's new notion of reason is the key difference between him and Wolff, especially in moral philosophy.\n\nmain issue, for Kant, or at least not the right way to frame it. Kant's arguments are likely meant to hold independently from a specific notion of reason, as they merely presuppose a comparatively  uncontroversial  conception  of  the  faculty  of  the  mind  enabling  to  cognize non-empirical  truths.  Furthermore,  if  Kant  maintains  that  pure  practical  reason  has  a lawgiving  role,  this  claim  is  part  of  his  solution  to  the  issue  of  the  bindingness  of  moral demands. He does not directly object to rationalists* that their understanding of the power of reason is crucially limited, (a) because providing an accurate account of reason is not the aim of their moral views, and (b) because such argument would in fact presuppose Kant's own view.\n\nNotably,  Kant's  critical  remarks  display  no  substantial  changes  through  the  various versions of the lectures. Most, if not all, objections are already present in the Herder notes and other texts of the 1760s. Furthermore, Kant mostly draws on objections previously put forward by Leibniz and other writers. If Kant's criticisms of the previous principles were meant as a step towards a more satisfying solution to the issue of the 'supreme principle of morality', as I have suggested, then how do they contribute to the development of the idea of autonomy?\n\nA way of understanding Kant's critical remarks could be to construe them as an 'only survivor' argument: ''All the other available views have fatal flaws', this kind of argument goes,  'and  mine  alone  survives  all  the  criticisms;  so  mine  is  the  best''  (Schneewind 2009: 141). Something of the kind does surface in Kant's notes:\n\n'I.  The principium of  morality  is  not  sensual,  neither directe or  pathological, lying  neither  in  the  physical  (doctrine  of  skill)  nor  the  moral  sense  (the  latter  is impossible,  because  no  sense  intrudes  on  the  intellectual);  nor indirecte sensual  or pragmatic  (doctrine  of  prudence):  considered  according  to  your  true  happiness (Epicureanism). There reason serves only as the means to determine how the greatest sum  of  inclinations  can  be  satisfied,  and  the  means  for  this.  The principium of morality  is  thus  intellectual  (pure),  but  not  tautological  ( perfice  te , medium tene ).  II. The principium is  not  external,  outside  the  nature  of  action,  lying  in  the  will  of another.' (Refl. 6754, 19:149)\n\nPassages like this, however, do not provide compelling evidence that Kant thought of his  criticisms  as  a  single  argument  by  elimination  for  the  principle  of  autonomy.  Similar\n\npassages are arguably ex post attempts to organize the presentation of the previous views in a critical summary like those given in the Groundwork and the second Critique . But this does entail that the function of Kant's criticisms is to highlight the only possible solution only by opposition.  More  importantly,  however,  interpreting  those  criticisms  as  an  argument  by elimination  obscures  two  decisive,  closely  connected  elements.  First,  Kant's  stance  to  the previous principles is not as homogeneous as the 'only survivor' reading implies, since he does  regard  some  principles  as  closer  to  the  truth  than  others.  Second,  Kant  tries  to incorporate aspects of other positions in his account (see also Bartuschat 2004). I shall clarify these points in turn.\n\nThe  two  aspects  are  closely  connected  because  a  first  intermediate  result  of  Kant's scrutiny is that empiricist principles are inadequate for explaining the bindingness of moral laws,  while  the  rationalist*  accounts  are  more  promising  (see  also  Wood  2015:  124). Therefore, a new account of the principle of morality should attempt a combination of the two rationalist* views. From very early on, Kant sees them as a more promising attempt at an  adequate  account  of  morality.  His  understanding  of  the  advantage  of  rationalist* conceptions  is  especially  clear  when  he  presents  the  empirical  principles  as  based  on 'contingent  grounds',  while  the  goal  is  to  explain  morality  'from  the  nature  of  free actions' (27:106). This is precisely what rationalist* views try to do, especially the internal view (cf. 29:622). More exactly, Kant holds that only a rationalist* view can account for what he considers as an essential feature of morality, that is, its necessity:\n\n'The  empiricism  of  morality  proves  only that no one approves of a lie ; rationalism, however, that no one can approve it , and indeed for itself alone; hence only in  the  latter  case  are  moral  imperatives  apodictic.  The  cause  is:  because  a  freedom without rule taken as universal authorization contradicts itself. The system is thus a rational system of freedom in universal consensus with itself' (Refl. 7217, 19:288).\n\nFor Kant, here lies the general difference between empiricism and rationalism. As he puts it in the second Critique , 'empiricism is based on a necessity felt, but rationalism on a necessity  seen  [ eingesehen ]'  (5:13).  Only  rationalist*  views  maintain  the  necessity  and objectivity of morality (see especially Kaehler 26, 27:254, 27:120). 25  This divide is so clear, for Kant,  that  the  view  that  he  is  searching  to  articulate  is  often  just  listed  as  one  of  the\n\n25  On this assumption in pre-Kantian rationalists: see Gill 1998.\n\nrationalist*  accounts. 26   Kant  holds  that,  since  the  available  rationalist*  views  are  not successful, a novel rationalist account of morality is needed.\n\nThus,  Kant's  critical  remarks  on  the  rationalist*  views  do  not  constitute  part  of  a continuous argument, but instead examine unsatisfactory answers to the question at issue that  are,  however,  instructive  in  important  respects.  An  'only  survivor'  argument  would entail that, one after another, all examined options are fully discarded. But understanding Kant's search in those terms obscures the fact that his new solution, centered on the idea of autonomy, is not only growing out of the rationalist* camp, but is also tied to both rationalist* views.  To  properly  understand  Kant's  stance,  it  is  necessary  to  look  into  his  view  of  the relationship between the two main variants, the perfectionist and the theological.\n\n## 5. Rationalism and the Law-Giving Will\n\nKant  does  not  discuss  the  perfectionist  view  very  extensively,  and  gives  greater prominence to the arguments against the theological account. This happens for two reasons: first,  the  importance  of  theological  accounts  in  the  moral  philosophy  of  his  times,  and second, the highly significant 'grain of truth' contained in the theological views.\n\nKant regards the theological principle as the most fashionable position of his time. His special attention to it seems in fact to be at least partially motivated by a worry regarding its success. In the Mrongovius II notes, he remarks that, while 'the principle of morality from external  empirical  grounds  has  but  few  adherents'  and  'the  metaphysical  principles [namely, of perfection and truth] are nowadays largely abandoned', 'a majority has fallen back on the theological principle,  because  the  metaphysical  one  lacks  force'  (29:622).  The\n\n26   See Kaehler 27 (cf. 27:255): 'what this inner intellectual principle consists in, it will be our aim in morals  to  determine,  though  it  can  only  be  extracted  gradually,  over  time.'  Note  that  the  label 'systema intellectuale' that Kant often uses for the rationalist* views might suggest a connection with Cudworth. Cudworth's main works were available in Samuel Mosheim's Latin translation under the general  title Systema  intellectuale  hujus  Universi (Jena  1733;  reprint  Leiden  1773),  which  includes, besides  the True  Intellectual  System ,  the Treatise  Concerning  Eternal  and  Immutable  Morality ,  in  which Cudworth states many of the arguments Kant deploys against the theological view. Kant must have been acquainted with Cudworth's works, since he owned Mosheim's edition (see Warda 1922: 47; also Tonelli 1967: 117 n. 29; Kuehn 2001: 470 n. 19).\n\nmention of Crusius along with 'other theological moralists' in the second Critique (5:40) also suggests  that  Kant's  worry  does  not  just  concern  a  few  writers,  but  is  a  more  general criticism. Besides Crusius himself and his followers, a theological view along similar lines had been defended also in Königsberg in the very years when Kant begun to work on these matters.  Daniel  Weymann,  Kant's  nemesis  in  the  early  years  of  his  career,  as  it  were, published in 1762 (roughly at the time when Kant was working out his first thoughts on the foundations of morals) a brief dissertation De vero stabiliendo juris naturae et gentium principio ( On Establishing the True Principle of Law of Nature and Nations ), which, under a Pufendorfian sounding title, argued for a broadly Crusian view of morality. 27  A theological conception was brought once more to the forefront by Barbeyrac, whose French translations of Pufendorf's main  works  provided  an  influential  support  to  the  divine  command  view,  along  with responses to earlier criticisms (see Schneewind 1996 and Korkman 2003). Finally, Kant also included in the theological camp the very authors he lectured on. Not only did Achenwall hold  such  a  view,  as  Kant  remarks  (cf.  27:1334),  but  Baumgarten  also  (and  his  follower Meier) had a similar position. While Wolff put greater emphasis on the naturalistic elements of  his  view,  Baumgarten's  account  had  a  distinctive  theological  turn,  which  entails  some quasi-voluntarist features:\n\n'the author of the obligation announced by the law is said to declare that law, and he who has the right to declare the laws is said, in an extended sense, to be a legislator  [...].  Now  God  is  the  author  of  the  whole  nature,  and  of  all  realities  that come to pass, and moreover all natural obligations are something real and positive, and have sufficient  reason  in  the  same. Therefore  God  is  the  author  of  obligation,  and thence also of the natural law ' (Baumgarten 1760: § 100).\n\nKant stresses this aspect of Baumgarten's position, expressing his disagreement in the clearest terms: 'Our author says: moral laws can be viewed as positive divine laws, but that is  wrong'  (29:635).  He  even  points  out  that,  in  this  respect,  Baumgarten's  and  Crusius'\n\nSee Schwaiger 2011: 146. On Kant's relationship to Weymann, see Kuehn 2001: 122-4. 27\n\npositions  are  indeed  not  far  apart. 28   In  fact,  in  his  lectures  Kant  introduces  the  important distinction between the author of the law and the legislator as author of the obligation of the law precisely to rectify this point of Baumgarten's (see Bacin 2013: 57).\n\nThe theological principle thus appeared to be the most prominent competitor in the discussion  on  the  foundations  of  morals.  In  spite  of  fundamental  mistakes,  however,  the theological principle provides a momentous clue that demands careful appreciation. On the one  hand,  Kant  declares  that  the  principle  of  perfection,  with  all  its  shortcomings,  is undoubtedly  superior  to  the  theological  principle  (cf.  4:443). 29   Similarly  to  Leibniz,  who regarded  it  as  a  'repugnant'  and  morally  dangerous  conception  (Leibniz  1706:  72),  Kant once even calls the theological view 'altogether wrong and false and deleterious' (27:135). On  the  other  hand,  though,  for  him  the  principle  of  perfection  does  not  provide  much material for further elaboration. Perfectionism merely states, in regrettably vague terms, one central requirement. Kant thus observes that it is 'not at odds with morality, but it cannot contribute anything to it either' (29:626). For this reason, it does not require a very extensive examination, since the Emptiness (or Vagueness) objection settles the question.\n\nAs  perfectionist  rationalism  rightly  acknowledges,  the  status  of  moral  laws  cannot allow for an author that ex  nihilo determines their normative content. This, however, does not  settle  the  question  of  obligation,  since  it  lacks  an  explanation  for  the  bindingness  of moral laws. For this, they need the lawgiving act of the author of their obligation. In the perfectionist  view,  Kant  implies,  there  is  no  conceptual  space  to  argue  for  that.  This  is possible,  however,  if  the  explanation  focuses  on  the  lawgiving  act  of  a  rational  will.  This claim is the distinctive grain of truth contained in theological accounts, which made them worthy of special attention for Kant. While he adopts the arguments of previous critics of theological voluntarism like Leibniz, he never concludes from the rejection of the theological\n\n28  See 27:510: 'Although the obligation is established by reason, it is nevertheless assumed that in the performance of our duty we have to regard ourselves as passive beings, and that another person must be  present,  who  necessitates  us  to  duty.  Crusius  found  this  necessitating  person  in  God, and Baumgarten  likewise  in  the  divine  will ,  albeit  known  through  reason,  and  not  positively,  and  on  this principle  a  particular  moral  system  has  been  erected.'  On  Kant's  contrast  to  Baumgarten  on  this matter, see Bacin 2015: 24-9.\n\nStern 2012: 57 (and passim )  greatly  stresses  this  point,  interpreting  theological  voluntarism  as the 29 main target of Kant's objections. On my reading, this is only one side of the coin.\n\nview that morality does not essentially need prescriptions and that commands are only a sort of backup, since the rational agent does not will according to rules. 30  Other rationalists had  explained  moral  obligation  by  arguing  that  the  intrinsic  'fitness'  of  some  actions directly  imposes  an  obligation,  without  requiring  any  act  of  will. 31   On  the  contrary,  Kant implies that such attempts collide with the conceptual impossibility of a genuine obligation for finite beings without reference to any will.\n\nIn  Kant's  eyes,  the  theological  view  oscillates  between  the  errors  that  make  it equivalent to an empirical account and the grain of truth that makes it a more complex case of  a  perfection-centered  view.  In  the  latter  case,  the  grain  of  truth  prevails,  but  the theological  element  ultimately  dissolves,  since  the  decisive  factor  lies  in  the  connection between  the  rational  will  as  such  and  the  idea  of  a  necessary  moral  law,  and  such  a connection  can  also  be  argued  for  with  regard  to  finite  rational  beings.  While  Barbeyrac insisted that God's lawgiving cannot be regarded as arbitrary, as it is bound to the criteria of rationality (see fn. 17 above), Kant presses the same point with regard to every reason. As a telling passage in the Powalski notes puts it, advocates of a theological account derive moral perfection 'either from experience or a priori'. Only in the latter case does the theological view properly belong to rationalism*. In order for the appeal to God's will to make sense, the  'theological  moralists'  must  refer  to  an  independently  valid  standard:  'They  must derive morality and the divine will from the inner quality of actions'. However, the moral worth of actions can be cognized by reason as such ('understanding can derive the good and bad from morality'). Therefore, it is ultimately not necessary to refer to the divine will: 'Since  the  understanding  is  the principium of  morality,  the  theological  principle  drops out' (27:121). The best version of the theological account would thus no longer require God's will as its foundation, since it revolves around the capacity of a rational will that, as such, draws  on  a  necessary  moral  standard  generating  binding  demands  through  universal volitions.\n\n30   See  e.g.  Leibniz  1706:  72:  'Whoever  does  good  out  of  love  for  God  or  for  his  neighbor,  takes pleasure  precisely  in  the  action  itself  (such  being  the  nature  of  love)  and  does  not  need  any  other incitement, or the command of a superior; for that man the saying that the law is not made for the just is valid'.\n\n31  See e.g. Clarke 1706: 626f. Wolff's notion of natural obligation is much along similar lines. See Wolff 1720: § 9 (trans. Schneewind).\n\nReworking this thought with respect to every rational will is a decisive step in Kant's development of his conception of the autonomy of the will. One remarkable passage in the Mrongovius  II  notes  suggests  that,  in  spite  of  the  weaknesses,  the  theological  principle points  out  the  necessity  of  a  reference  to  a  will  in  explaining  moral  obligation.  After presenting the objections that I have examined above, Kant there remarks:\n\n'It seems as if duty had as its foundation the will of a legislator, not something one does according to one's own will but according to the will of another. But the will of another is not the will of another being; but rather our own will, in so far we make  it  universal and  consider  it  as  a  universal  rule.  Such  a  will  proceeds  as  a universal , not as a private will' (29:627, my emphasis).\n\nKant's  dissatisfaction  with  the  inability  of  perfectionist  rationalism  to  account  for moral  obligation  remarkably  matches  the  critical  comment  on  Wolff's  universal  practical philosophy  in  the Groundwork (4:390;  cf.  29:598) . Universal  practical  philosophy  can  be regarded,  from  Kant's  standpoint,  as  the  most  detailed  attempt  to  include  in  practical philosophy  a  investigation  into  the  will. 32   Such  an  attempt  cannot  but  miss  the  point, though, if it does not explore the intrinsic connection between will and obligation. In Kant's view,  universal  practical  philosophy  only  considered  a  generic  will  as  the addressee of obligations,  that  is,  according  to  Wolff's  view  of  obligation,  a  capacity  to  act  according  to motives. Therefore he missed the crucial link between obligation and will, namely its active 33 side, because he did not consider under which conditions, on which principles, and thanks to which capacities, a will can issue a valid moral obligation. The theological view provides an insight that allows to fill this lacuna. The underlying thought in Kant's incorporation of the substance of the theological view, thus, is not to substitute the divine sovereign will with a God-like 'transcendental subject' who declares the unconstrained legislative power of his will, as has often been objected. On Kant's view, the theological view is significant, instead, because it gives prominence to the role of a will as author of moral obligation, pointing at a\n\n32  Note that Kant's criticism also applies to empiricist versions of universal practical philosophy like Johann Georg Heinrich Feder's. See Bacin 2017b.\n\n33   Wolff  understands  obligation  as  the  connection  of  an  action  with  a  motive.  See  Wolff  1720:  §  8, (trans.  Schneewind): 'To obligate someone to do or omit something is only to connect a motive of willing or not willing to it'.\n\nrational will that operates under the constraint of an independent standard of morality in universal volitions. 34   While Kant follows the rationalist tradition in embracing the Pauline thought  of  'being  a  law  unto  oneself',  he  construes  it  differently  than  Clarke,  Price  and Wolff,  and  suggests  that  that  thought  conveys  the  decisive  property  of  the  lawgiving will (see GMS 4:440, 29:628). 35\n\nKant's  remarks  on  the  two  main  rationalist*  principles,  thus,  ultimately  suggest  a combination of them as the adequate solution of the issue of moral obligation. Different, yet apparently  complementary  advantages  of  the  two  rationalist*  principles  already  surfaced when  Kant  was  strongly  interested  in  sentimentalist  views.  In  the Distinctness essay  of 1762/64 he observed that the general rule 'do the most perfect thing', which corresponds to the perfectionist standard of morality, provides the formal principle of morality. However, no  specific  obligations  derive  from  it.  For  this,  'indemonstrable  material  principles'  are needed (2:299). Kant's only example of such a principle is none other than the theological principle: 'do what is in accordance with the will of God' (2:300). The early essay did not articulate  how  the  suggestion  should  be  worked  out.  In  fact,  a  longer  process  was  still required to formulate Kant's own solution. Nevertheless, the early remarks show that Kant considers the two rationalist* views as compatible. He implies that they must be integrated, in order to properly explain both the universal form of moral obligation and the bindingness of  specific  demands. All  this  suggests  that,  at  least  since  the  early  1760s,  one  of  the  main goals of Kant's work in moral philosophy was to find the right way to combine the insights of  the  two  rationalist*  principles.  Looking  for  the  appropriate  combination  represents  a seminal thread in his development of the idea of autonomy.\n\n## 6. Conclusion\n\nIn  the Groundwork and  the  second Critique the  previous  views  of  morality  are  only discussed with regard to the general charge of heteronomy, which, derived by contrast from\n\n34   Kant's  conception  could  arguably  draw  as  much  on  Malebranche's  theory  of  God's  general volitions as on Rousseau's volonté generale , as is mostly assumed. See Riley 1986.\n\n35   See Andy Reath's chapter in this volume. On the difference of Kant's use of the Pauline thought from Butler's, Price's, and Wolff's see Bacin 2013.\n\nthe new idea of autonomy (see 29:629), points out that all previous accounts miss that crucial thought.  Before  1785,  when  the  heteronomy  objection  is  absent,  Kant  sketches  a  more differentiated  assessment,  providing  significant  insights  in  the  development  of  his  own conception.\n\nThe idea of autonomy introduced in 1785, in the Groundwork and in the contemporary lectures on natural law and moral philosophy, represents the outcome of a process in which the assessment of previous views has an essential part. Rationalist* conception, in particular, provided  Kant  with  decisive  conceptual  elements  to  work  out.  When  Kant  puts  forward autonomy as the supreme principle of morality (GMS 4:440; cf. KpV 5:33, 27:1326, 29:626), he presents  a  feature  of  the  rational  will  -  that  is,  its  being  'a  law  unto  itself'  -  as  the foundation of moral obligation. This solution, unthinkable for traditional rationalists, grows out of the suggestion that the advantages of the two rationalist* conceptions are complementary and must be integrated.\n\nKant's project emerges from the failures of previous rationalist attempts and sets as its goal  to  work  out  a  rationalist  view  that,  by  integrating  insights  from  the  theological conception, can account for the bindingness of moral demands. The new idea of autonomy emerges, in this respect, from the spirit of rationalism. Kant's criticisms of rationalist* views thus  do  not  merely  assess  the  state  of  the  art,  but  prepare  the  stage  for  a  new  position. Examining  these  accounts,  he  makes  it  clear  that  only  a  rationalist  view  can  provide  a satisfactory account of the necessity and categoricity of moral demands, since only reason can  cognize  necessary  a  priori  concepts. At  the  same  time,  he  highlights  that  the  binding force of morality requires the act of a will. A combination of perfectionism and theological views thus provides the basic outline of the idea of autonomy of the will. Kant's criticisms of the two rationalist* views thus leads to autonomy being construed as a two-tiered notion, which  emphasizes  both  rationalist and  voluntarist elements. Kant's assessment of 36\n\n36  On Kant's idea of autonomy as a two-tiered notion combining rationalist and voluntarist elements see Bacin 2013 and Bacin 2017c.\n\nrationalist*  views  recommends  an  account  of  autonomy  that  accommodates  both  the lawgiving function of a rational will and the legislation of a non-positive, necessary law. 37\n\n## References\n\nBacin, Stefano 2006.
