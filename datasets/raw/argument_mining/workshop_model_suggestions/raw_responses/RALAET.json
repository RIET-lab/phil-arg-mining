Based on the metaphor of bringing light to the Dark Age, the Age  of  the  Enlightenment  ( Siècle  des  lumières in  French  and Aufklärung in German) shifted allegiances away from absolute authority, whether religious or  political,  to  more  skeptical  and  optimistic  attitudes  about  human  nature, religion and politics.  In the American context, thinkers such as Thomas Paine, James  Madison,  Thomas  Jefferson,  John  Adams  and  Benjamin  Franklin invented and adopted revolutionary ideas about scientific rationality, religious toleration and experimental political organization-ideas that would have farreaching  effects  on  the  development  of  the  fledgling  nation.   Some  coupled science and religion in the notion of deism; others asserted the natural rights of man in the anti-authoritarian doctrine of liberalism; and still others touted the importance of cultivating virtue, enlightened leadership and community in early  forms  of  republican  thinking. At  least  six  ideas  came  to  punctuate American Enlightenment thinking: deism, liberalism, republicanism, conservatism,  toleration  and  scientific  progress.  Many  of  these  were  shared with European Enlightenment thinkers, but in some instances took a uniquely American form.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n1. Enlightenment Age Thinking\n1.

Enlightenment Age Thinking\n\nThe pre- and post-revolutionary era in American history generated propitious conditions  for  Enlightenment  thought  to  thrive  on  an  order  comparable  to that  witnessed  in  the  European  Enlightenments.    In  the  pre-revolutionary years, Americans reacted to the misrule of King George III, the unfairness of Parliament ('taxation without representation') and exploitative treatment at the  hands  of  a  colonial  power:  the  English  Empire.   The  Englishman-cumrevolutionary  Thomas  Paine  wrote  the  famous  pamphlet The  Rights  of  Man , decrying the abuses of the  North  American  colonies by their English masters.   In  the  post-revolutionary  years,  a  whole  generation  of  American thinkers would found a new system of government on liberal and republican principles, articulating their enduring ideas in documents such as the Declaration of Independence , the Federalist Papers and the United States Constitution .\n\nAlthough  distinctive features arose in the eighteenth-century  American context,  much  of  the  American  Enlightenment  was  continuous  with  parallel experiences  in  British  and  French  society.   Four  themes  recur  in  both\n\nEuropean  and  American  Enlightenment  texts:  modernization,  skepticism, reason  and  liberty.  Modernization  means  that  beliefs  and  institutions  based on absolute moral, religious and political authority (such as the divine right of kings and the Ancien Régime ) will become increasingly eclipsed by those based on science, rationality and religious pluralism. Many Enlightenment thinkers-especially  the  French philosophes ,  such  as  Voltaire,  Rousseau  and Diderot-subscribed to some form of skepticism, doubting appeals to miraculous,  transcendent  and  supernatural  forces  that  potentially  limit  the scope of individual choice and reason.  Reason that is universally shared and definitive of the human nature also became a dominant theme in Enlightenment  thinkers'  writings,  particularly  Immanuel  Kant's  'What  is Enlightenment?' and his Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals .   The  fourth theme,  liberty  and  rights  assumed  a  central  place  in  theories  of  political association, specifically as limits state authority originating prior to the advent of  states  (that  is,  in  a  state  of  nature)  and  manifesting  in social  contracts , especially  in  John  Locke's Second  Treatise  on  Civil  Government and  Thomas Jefferson's drafts of the Declaration of Independence .\n\n## a. Moderate and Radical\n\nBesides identifying dominant themes running throughout the Enlightenment period, some historians, such as Henry May and Jonathan Israel, understand Enlightenment thought as divisible into two broad categories, each reflecting the  content  and  intensity  of  ideas  prevalent  at  the  time.   The  moderate Enlightenment signifies commitments  to economic liberalism, religious toleration and constitutional politics.   In contrast to its moderate incarnation, the radical Enlightenment conceives enlightened thought through the prism of revolutionary  rhetoric  and  classical  Republicanism.   Some  commentators argue  that  the  British  Enlightenment  (especially  figures  such  as  James Hutton, Adam Ferguson and Adam Smith) was essentially moderate, while the French (represented by Denis Diderot, Claude Adrien Helvétius and François Marie Arouet) was decidedly more radical.  Influenced as it was by the British and French, American Enlightenment thought integrates both moderate and radical elements.\n\n## b. Chronology\n\nAmerican Enlightenment thought can also be appreciated chronologically, or in  terms  of  three  temporal  stages  in  the  development  of  Enlightenment  Age thinking.  The early stage stretches from the time of the Glorious Revolution of 1688  to  1750,  when  members  of  Europe's  middle  class  began  to  break  free from  the  monarchical  and  aristocratic  regimes-whether  through  scientific discovery,  social  and  political  change  or  emigration  outside  of  Europe, including  America.   The  middle  stage  extends  from  1751  to  just  a  few  years after  the  start  of  the  American  Revolution  in  1779.  It  is  characterized  by  an exploding  fascination  with  science,  religious  revivalism  and  experimental forms of government, especially in the United States.  The late stage begins in 1780 and ends with the rise of Napoléon Bonaparte, as the French Revolution comes to a close in 1815-a period in which the European Enlightenment was in decline, while the American Enlightenment reclaimed and institutionalized many of its seminal ideas.  However, American Enlightenment thinkers were not always of a single mind with their European counterparts.  For instance, several  American  Enlightenment  thinkers-particularly  James  Madison  and John Adams, though not Benjamin Franklin-judged the French philosophes to be morally degenerate intellectuals of the era.\n\n## c. Democracy and the Social Contract\n\nMany  European and American Enlightenment figures were critical of democracy.  Skepticism about the value of democratic institutions was likely a legacy of Plato's belief that democracy led to tyranny and Aristotle's view that democracy was the best of the worst forms of government.  John Adams and James Madison perpetuated the elitist and anti-democratic idea that to invest too much political power in the hands of uneducated and property-less people was to put society at constant risk of social and political upheaval.  Although several  of  America's  Enlightenment  thinkers  condemned  democracy,  others were  more  receptive  to  the  idea  of  popular  rule  as  expressed  in  European social  contract  theories.   Thomas  Jefferson  was  strongly  influenced  by John Locke's  social  contract  theory ,  while  Thomas  Paine  found  inspiration  in  JeanJacques  Rousseau's.   In  the Two  Treatises  on  Government (1689  and  1690),\n\nLocke  argued  against  the  divine  right  of  kings  and  in  favor  of  government grounded on the consent of the governed; so long as people would have agreed to hand over some of their liberties enjoyed in a pre-political society or state of nature  in  exchange  for  the  protection  of  basic  rights  to  life,  liberty  and property.   However,  if  the  state  reneged  on  the  social  contract  by  failing  to protect those natural rights, then the people had a right to revolt and form a new government. Perhaps more of a democrat than Locke, Rousseau insisted in The  Social  Contract (1762)  that  citizens  have  a  right  of  self-government, choosing the rules by which they live and the judges who shall enforce those rules. If the relationship between the will of the state and the will of the people (the  'general  will')  is  to  be  democratic,  it  should  be  mediated  by  as  few institutions as possible.\n\n## 2. Six Key Ideas\n\nAt least six ideas came to punctuate American Enlightenment thinking: deism, liberalism,  republicanism,  conservatism,  toleration  and  scientific  progress. Many  of  these  were  shared  with  European  Enlightenment  thinkers,  but  in some instances took a uniquely American form.\n\n## a. Deism\n\nEuropean Enlightenment thinkers conceived tradition, custom and prejudice ( Vorurteil )  as  barriers  to  gaining  true  knowledge  of  the  universal  laws  of nature.  The solution was deism or understanding God's existence as divorced from holy books, divine providence, revealed religion, prophecy and miracles; instead  basing  religious  belief  on  reason  and  observation  of  the  natural world. Deists appreciated  God  as  a  reasonable  Deity.   A  reasonable  God endowed humans with rationality in order that they might discover the moral instructions of the universe in the natural law.  God created the universal laws that govern nature, and afterwards humans realize God's will through sound judgment and wise action. Deists were typically (though not always) Protestants, sharing a disdain for the religious dogmatism  and blind obedience to tradition exemplified by the Catholic Church.  Rather than fight members  of  the  Catholic  faith  with  violence  and  intolerance,  most  deists resorted to the use of tamer weapons such as humor and mockery.\n\nBoth moderate and radical American Enlightenment thinkers, such as James Madison, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, John Adams and George Washington, were deists.   Some struggled with the tensions between Calvinist orthodoxy and deist beliefs, while other subscribed to the populist version of deism  advanced  by  Thomas  Paine  in The Age of  Reason . Franklin  was remembered  for  stating  in  the  Constitutional  Convention  that  'the  longer  I live,  the  more  convincing  proof  I  see  of  this  truth-that  God  governs  in  the affairs of men.' In what would become known as the Jefferson Bible (originally The  Life  and  Morals  of  Jesus  of  Nazareth ),  Jefferson  chronicles the  life  and  times  of  Jesus  Christ  from  a  deist  perspective,  eliminating  all mention of miracles or divine intervention.  God for deists such as Jefferson never  loomed  large  in  humans'  day-to-day  life  beyond  offering  a  moral  or humanistic outlook and the resource of reason to discover the content of God's laws.  Despite the near absence of God in human life, American deists did not deny His existence, largely because the majority of the populace still remained strongly  religious,  traditionally  pious  and  supportive  of  the  good  works  (for example monasteries, religious schools and community service) that the clergy did.\n\n## b. Liberalism\n\nAnother idea central to American Enlightenment thinking is liberalism, that is, the notion that humans have natural rights and that government authority is  not  absolute,  but  based  on  the  will  and  consent  of  the  governed.   Rather than a radical or revolutionary doctrine, liberalism was  rooted  in the commercial harmony and tolerant Protestantism embraced by merchants in Northern  Europe,  particularly  Holland  and  England.   Liberals  favored  the interests  of  the  middle  class  over  those  of  the  high-born  aristocracy,  an outlook of tolerant pluralism that did not discriminate between consumers or citizens based on their race or creed, a legal system devoted to the protection of  private  property  rights,  and  an  ethos  of  strong  individualism  over  the passive collectivism associated with feudal arrangements. Liberals also preferred rational argumentation and free exchange of ideas to the uncritical of religious doctrine or governmental mandates.  In this way, liberal thinking was  anti-authoritarian.   Although  later  liberalism  became  associated  with grassroots  democracy  and  a  sharp  separation  of  the  public  and  private domains, early liberalism favored a parliamentarian form of government that protected  liberty  of  expression  and  movement,  the  right  to  petition  the government, separation of church and state and the confluence of public and private interests in philanthropic and entrepreneurial endeavors.\n\nThe claim that private individuals have fundamental God-given rights, such as to property, life, liberty and to pursue their conception of  good, begins with the  English  philosopher  John  Locke,  but  also  finds  expression  in  Thomas Jefferson's drafting of the Declaration of Independence .   The U.S. Bill of Rights, the  first  ten  amendments  to  the  Constitution,  guarantees  a  schedule  of individual rights based on the liberal ideal. During  the constitutional convention, James Madison responded to the anti-Federalists' demand for a bill  of  rights  as  a  condition  of  ratification  by  reviewing  over  two-hundred proposals and distilling them into an initial list of twelve suggested amendments to the Constitution, covering the rights of free speech, religious liberty, right to bear arms and habeas corpus , among others.  While ten of those suggested  were  ratified  in  1791,  one  missing  amendment  (stopping  laws created  by Congress to increase its members' salaries from taking effect until the next legislative term) would have to wait until 1992 to be ratified as the Twenty-seventh  Amendment.   Madison's  concern  that  the  Bill  of  Rights should  apply  not only  to  the  federal  government  would  eventually  be accommodated with the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment (especially its due process clause) in 1868 and a series of Supreme Court cases throughout the twentieth-century interpreting each of the ten amendments as 'incorporated' and thus protecting citizens against state governments as well.\n\n## c. Republicanism\n\nClassical republicanism is a commitment to the notion that a nation ought to be ruled as a republic, in which selection of the state's highest public official is determined by a general election, rather  than  through  a  claim  to  hereditary right.   Republican  values  include  civic  patriotism,  virtuous  citizenship  and property-based personality. Developed during late antiquity and early renaissance,  classic  republicanism  differed  from  early  liberalism  insofar  as rights were not thought to be granted by God in a pre-social state of nature, but were the products of living in political society.  On the classical republican view of liberty, citizens exercise freedom within the context of existing social relations, historical associations and traditional communities, not as autonomous individuals set apart from their social and political ties.  In this way,  liberty  for  the  classical  republican  is  positively  defined  by  the  political society  instead  of  negatively  defined  in  terms  of  the  pre-social  individual's natural rights.\n\nWhile prefigured by the European Enlightenment, the American Enlightenment also promoted the idea that a nation should be governed as a republic, whereby the state's head is popularly elected, not appointed through a  hereditary  blood-line.   As  North  American  colonists  became  increasingly convinced that British rule was corrupt and inimical to republican values, they joined militias and eventually formed the American Continental Army under George  Washington's  command.    The  Jeffersonian  ideal  of  the  yeoman farmer,  which  had  its  roots  in  the  similar  Roman  ideal,  represented  the eighteenth-century  American  as  both  a  hard-working  agrarian  and  as  a citizen-soldier devoted to the republic.  When elected to the highest office of the  land,  George  Washington famously demurred when offered a royal title, preferring  instead  the  more  republican  title  of  President.   Though  scholarly debate persists over the relative importance of liberalism and republicanism during the American Revolution and Founding (see Recent Work section), the view that republican ideas were a formative influence on American Enlightenment thinking has gained widespread acceptance.\n\n## d. Conservatism\n\nThough  the  Enlightenment  is  more  often  associated  with  liberalism  and republicanism, an undeniable strain of conservatism emerged in the last stage of  the  Enlightenment,  mainly  as  a  reaction  to  the  excesses  of  the  French\n\nRevolution.   In  1790  Edmund  Burkeanticipated  the  dissipation  of  order  and decency in French society following the revolution (often referred to as 'the Terror') in his Reflections on the Revolution in France .   Though it is argued that Burkean conservatism was a reaction to the Enlightenment (or antiEnlightenment),  conservatives  were  also  operating  within  the  framework  of Enlightenment  ideas.   Some  Enlightenment  claims  about  human  nature  are turned back upon themselves and shown to break down when applied more generally  to  human  culture.   For  instance,  Enlightenment  faith  in  universal declarations of human rights do more harm than good when they contravene the  conventions  and  traditions  of  specific  nations,  regions  and  localities. Similar  to  the  classical  republicans,  Burke  believed  that  human  personality was the product of living in a political society, not a set of natural rights that predetermined  our  social  and  political  relations.  Conservatives  attacked  the notion  of  a  social  contract  (prominent  in  the  work  of  Hobbes,  Locke  and Rousseau) as a mythical construction that overlooked the plurality of groups and  perspectives  in  society,  a  fact  which  made  brokering  compromises inevitable and  universal consent  impossible. Burke  only  insisted on  a tempered version, not a wholesale rejection of Enlightenment values.\n\nConservatism featured strongly in American Enlightenment thinking.  While Burke  was  critical  of  the  French  Revolution,  he  supported  the  American Revolution for disposing of English colonial misrule while creatively readapting British traditions and institutions to the American temperament.  American Enlightenment thinkers such as James Madison and John Adams held views that echoed and in some cases anticipated Burkean conservatism, leading them to criticize the rise of revolutionary France and the popular pro-French Jacobin clubs during and after the French Revolution.  In the  forty-ninth  Federalist  Paper,  James  Madison  deployed  a  conservative argument  against  frequent  appeals  to  democratic  publics  on  constitutional questions because  they threatened to undermine  political stability  and substitute popular passion for the 'enlightened reason' of elected representatives.  Madison's  conservative  view  was  opposed  to  Jefferson's liberal view that a constitutional convention should be convened every twenty years,  for  '[t]he  earth  belongs  to  the  living  generation,'  and  so  each  new generation should be empowered to reconsider its constitutional norms.\n\n## e. Toleration\n\nToleration  or  tolerant  pluralism  was  also  a  major  theme  in  American Enlightenment thought.  Tolerance of difference developed in parallel with the early  liberalism  prevalent  among  Northern  Europe's  merchant  class.   It reflected  their  belief  that  hatred  or  fear  of  other  races  and  creeds  interfered with economic trade, extinguished freedom of thought and expression, eroded the basis for friendship among nations and led to persecution and war. Tiring of religious wars (particularly as the 16 th  century French wars of religion and the 17 th  century Thirty Years War), European Enlightenment thinkers imagined  an  age  in  which  enlightened  reason  not  religious  dogmatism governed relations between diverse peoples with loyalties to different faiths. The  Protestant Reformation  and  the  Treaty  of Westphalia  significantly weakened the Catholic  Papacy,  empowered  secular  political  institutions  and provided the conditions for independent nation-states to flourish.\n\nAmerican  thinkers  inherited  this  principle  of  tolerant  pluralism  from  their European Enlightenment forebearers.  Inspired by the Scottish Enlightenment thinkers John Knox and George Buchanan, American Calvinists created open, friendly  and  tolerant  institutions  such  as  the  secular  public  school  and democratically organized religion (which became the Presbyterian Church). Many  American  Enlightenment  thinkers, including  Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, read and agreed with John Locke's A Letter Concerning Toleration .   In  it,  Locke  argued that government is ill-equipped to  judge  the  rightness  or  wrongness  of  opposing  religious doctrines,  faith  could  not  be  coerced  and  if  attempted  the  result  would  be greater religious and political discord.   So, civil government ought to protect liberty of conscience, the right to worship as one chooses (or not to worship at all)  and  refrain  from  establishing  an  official  state-sanctioned  church.   For America's  founders,  the  fledgling  nation  was  to  be  a  land  where  persons  of every  faith  or  no  faith  could  settle  and  thrive  peacefully  and  cooperatively without fear of persecution by government or fellow citizens.  Ben Franklin's belief that religion was an aid to cultivating virtue led him to donate funds to every  church  in  Philadelphia.   Defending  freedom  of  conscience,  James Madison would write that '[c]onscience is the most sacred of all property.'  In 1777, Thomas  Jefferson drafted a religious liberty bill for Virginia to disestablish the government-sponsored Anglican Church-often referred to as 'the  precursor  to  the  Religion  Clauses  of  the  First  Amendment'-which eventually passed with James Madison's help.\n\n## f. Scientific Progress\n\nThe Enlightenment enthusiasm for scientific discovery was directly related to the growth of deism and skepticism about received religious doctrine.  Deists engaged in scientific inquiry not only to satisfy their intellectual curiosity, but to  respond  to  a  divine  calling  to  expose  God's  natural  laws.   Advances  in scientific  knowledge-whether  the  rejection  of  the  geocentric  model  of  the universe because of Copernicus, Kepler and Galileo's work or the discovery of natural laws such as Newton's mathematical explanation of gravity-removed the  need  for  a  constantly  intervening  God.   With  the  release  of  Sir  Isaac Newton's Principia in 1660, faith in scientific progress took institutional form in the Royal Society of England, the Académie des Sciences in France and later the Academy of Sciences in Germany.  In pre-revolutionary America, scientists or  natural  philosophers  belonged  to  the  Royal  Society  until  1768,  when Benjamin Franklin helped create and then served as the first president of the American  Philosophical  Society.   Franklin  became  one  of  the  most  famous American  scientists  during  the  Enlightenment  period  because  of  his  many practical inventions and his theoretical work on the properties of electricity.\n\n## 3. Four American Enlightenment Thinkers\n\nWhat follows are brief accounts of how four significant thinkers contributed to the eighteenth-century American Enlightenment: Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison and John Adams.\n\n## a. Franklin\n\nBenjamin  Franklin,  the  author,  printer,  scientist  and  statesman  who  led America through a tumultuous period of colonial politics, a revolutionary war and  its  momentous,  though  no  less  precarious,  founding  as  a  nation.   In his Autobiography , he extolled the virtues of thrift, industry and money-making (or  acquisitiveness).   For  Franklin,  the  self-interested  pursuit  of  material wealth  is  only  virtuous  when  it  coincides  with  the  promotion  of  the  public good through philanthropy and voluntarism-what is often called 'enlightened self-interest.' He  believed that reason, free trade and a cosmopolitan  spirit  serve  as  faithful  guides  for  nation-states  to  cultivate peaceful relations. Within nation-states, Franklin thought that 'independent entrepreneurs make good citizens' because they pursue 'attainable goals' and are  'capable  of  living  a  useful  and  dignified  life.'  In  his  autobiography, Franklin  claims  that  the  way  to  'moral  perfection'  is  to  cultivate  thirteen virtues  (temperance,  silence,  order,  resolution,  frugality,  industry,  sincerity, justice, moderation, cleanliness, tranquility, chastity, and humility) as well as a healthy dose of 'cheerful prudence.'  Franklin favored voluntary associations over  governmental  institutions  as  mechanisms  to  channel  citizens'  extreme individualism  and  isolated  pursuit  of  private  ends  into  productive  social outlets.   Not  only  did  Franklin  advise  his  fellow  citizens  to  create  and  join these associations, but he also founded and participated in many himself.   Franklin  was  a  staunch  defender  of  federalism,  a  critic  of  narrow parochialism,  a  visionary  leader  in  world  politics  and  a  strong  advocate  of religious liberty.\n\n## b. Jefferson\n\nA  Virginian  statesman,  scientist  and  diplomat,  Jefferson  is  probably  best known  for  drafting  the Declaration  of  Independence .   Agreeing  with  Benjamin Franklin,  he  substituted  'pursuit  of  happiness'  for  'property'  in  Locke's schedule of natural rights, so that liberty to pursue the widest possible human ends  would  be  accommodated.   Jefferson  also  exercised  immense  influence over  the  creation  of  the  United  States'  Constitution  through  his  extended correspondence with James Madison during the 1787 Constitutional\n\nConvention (since Jefferson was absent, serving as a diplomat in Paris).  Just as  Jefferson  saw  the Declaration as  a  test  of  the  colonists'  will  to  revolt  and separate  from  Britain,  he  also  saw  the  Convention  in  Philadelphia,  almost eleven  years  later,  as  a  grand  experiment  in  creating  a  new  constitutional order.   Panel  four  of  the  Jefferson  Memorial  records  how  Thomas  Jefferson viewed constitutions: 'I am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions,  but  laws  and  institutions  must  go  hand  in  hand  with  the progress  of  the  human  mind.  As  that  becomes  more  developed,  more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths discovered and manners and  opinions  change,  with  the  change  of  circumstances,  institutions  must advance also to keep pace with the times.'  Jefferson's words capture the spirit of organic constitutionalism, the idea that constitutions are living documents that  transform  over  time  in  pace  with  popular  thought,  imagination  and opinion.\n\n## c. Madison\n\nHeralded as the 'Father of the Constitution,' James Madison was, besides one of the most influential architects of the U.S. Constitution, a man of letters, a politician, a scientist and a diplomat who left an enduring legacy on American philosophical  thought.   As  a  tireless  advocate  for  the  ratification  of  the Constitution, Madison advanced his most groundbreaking ideas in his jointly authoring The Federalist Papers with John Jay and Alexander Hamilton.  Indeed, two of his most enduring ideas-the large republic thesis and  the  argument  for  separation-of-powers  and  checks-and-balances-are contained there.  In the tenth Federalist paper, Madison explains the problem of  factions,  namely,  that  the  development  of  groups  with  shared  interests (advocates  or  interest  groups)  is  inevitable  and  dangerous  to  republican government.  If we try to vanquish factions, then we will in turn destroy the liberty  upon  which  their  existence  and  activities  are  founded.  Baron  d' Montesquieu, the seventeenth-century French philosopher, believed that the only way to have a functioning republic, one that was sufficiently democratic, was  for  it  to  be  small,  both  in  population  and  land  mass  (on  the  order  of Ancient Athens or Sparta).  He then argues that a large and diverse republic will stop the formation  of a majority faction; if small  groups  cannot communicate over long distances and coordinate effectively, the threat will be negated  and  liberty  will  be  preserved  ('you  make  it  less  probable  that  a majority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of other citizens').  When factions formed inside the government, a clever institutional design  of  checks  and  balances  (first  John  Adams's  idea,  where  each  branch would have a hand in the others' domain) would avert excessive harm, so that 'ambition must be made to counteract ambition' and, consequently, government will effectively 'control itself.'\n\n## d. Adams\n\nJohn Adams was also a founder, statesman, diplomat and eventual President who  contributed  to  American  Enlightenment  thought.   Among  his  political writings,  three  stand  out: Dissertation  on  the  Canon  and  Feudal  Law (1776), A Defense of the Constitutions of Government of the United States of America, Against the Attack of M. Turgot (1787-8), and Discourses on Davila (1791). In the Dissertation ,  Adams  faults  Great  Britain  for  deciding  to  introduce  canon and feudal law, 'the two greatest systems of tyranny,' to the North American colonies.  Once  introduced,  elections  ceased  in  the  North  American  colonies, British subjects felt enslaved and revolution became inevitable. In the Defense ,  Adams offers an uncompromising defense of republicanism.  He disputes  Turgot's  apology  for  unified  and  centralized  government,  arguing that  insurance  against  consolidated  state  power  and  support  for  individual liberty require separating government powers between branches and installing careful  checks  and  balances.   Nevertheless,  a  strong  executive  branch  is needed to defend the people against 'aristocrats' who will attempt to deprive liberty  from  the  mass  of  people.   Revealing  the  Enlightenment  theme  of conservatism, Adams criticized the notion of unrestricted popular rule or pure democracy in the Discourses .   Since humans are always desirous of increasing their personal power and reputation, all the while making invidious comparisons, government must be designed to constrain the effects of these passionate tendencies.  Adams writes: 'Consider that government is intended to set bounds to passions which nature has not limited; and to assist reason, conscience, justice, and truth in controlling interests which, without it, would be as unjust as uncontrollable.'\n\n## 4. Contemporary Work\n\nInvocations of universal freedom draw their inspiration from Enlightenment thinkers  such  as  John  Locke,  Immanuel  Kant,  and  Thomas  Jefferson,  but come into conflict with contemporary liberal appeals to multiculturalism and pluralism.   Each  of  these  Enlightenment  thinkers  sought  to  ground  the legitimacy of the state on a theory of rational-moral political order reflecting universal truths about human nature-for instance, that humans are carriers of  inalienable  rights  (Locke),  autonomous  agents  (Kant),  or  fundamentally equal creations (Jefferson). However, many  contemporary liberals-for instance, Graeme Garrard, John Gray and Richard Rorty-fault Enlightenment liberalism for its failure to acknowledge and accommodate the differences  among  citizens'  incompatible  and  equally  reasonable  religious, moral and philosophical doctrines, especially in multicultural societies.   According  to  these  critics,  Enlightenment  liberalism,  rather  than offering a neutral framework, discloses a full-blooded doctrine that competes with alternative views of truth, the good life, and human nature.  This pluralist critique  of  Enlightenment  liberalism's  universalism  makes  it  difficult  to harmonize  the  American  Founders'  appeal  to  universal  human  rights  with their insistence on religious tolerance.  However, as previously noted, evidence of Burkean conservatism offers an alternative to the strong universalism that these recent commentators criticize in American Enlightenment thought.\n\nWhat in recent times has been characterized as the 'Enlightenment project' is the  general  idea  that  human  rationality  can  and  should  be  made  to  serve ethical and humanistic ends.  If human societies are to achieve genuine moral progress, parochialism, dogma and prejudice ought to give way to science and reason  in  efforts  to  solve  pressing  problems.  The  American  Enlightenment project signifies how  America  has taken a leading role in promoting Enlightenment ideals during that period of human history commonly referred to  as  'modernity.'   Still,  there  is  no  consensus  about  the  exact  legacy  of American Enlightenment thinkers-for instance, whether republican or liberal ideas are predominant.   Until  the publication of J. G. A. Pocock's The Machiavellian  Moment (1975),  most  scholars  agreed  that  liberal  (especially\n\nLockean)  ideas  were  more  dominant  than  republican  ones.   Pockock's  work initiated  a  sea  change  towards  what  is  now  the  widely  accepted  view  that liberal and republican ideas had relatively equal sway during the eighteenthcentury  Enlightenment,  both  in  America  and  Europe.   Gordon  Wood  and Bernard  Bailyn  contend  that  republicanism  was  dominant  and  liberalism recessive  in  American  Enlightenment  thought.   Isaac  Kramnick  still  defends the orthodox position that American Enlightenment thinking was exclusively Lockean and liberal, thus explaining the strongly individualistic character of modern American culture.\n\n## 5.
