    "system_prompt": "## GOAL\nArgument‑mine the following paper to extract its comprehensive argumentative structure.\n\n## DEFINITIONS\n1. **Argument**: A set of propositions, including some number of premises and a conclusion. The premises should logically entail the conclusion.\n2. **Claim**: A proposition that asserts something to be true or false, typically requiring justification or evidence.\n3. **Premise**: A proposition that provides evidence, justification, or logical support for a claim or conclusion.\n\n## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS\n1. **VERBATIM EXTRACTION ONLY**: Each ADU text must be copied EXACTLY from the paper with no modifications, paraphrasing, or combining of separate sentences.\n2. **NO HALLUCINATION**: Do not create, modify, or invent text that does not appear exactly in the source.\n3. **EXACT MATCHING**: Every word, punctuation mark, and spacing must match the original precisely.\n\n## DIRECTIONS\n1. **Identify Argumentative Discourse Units (ADUs)**  \n   - ADU = any contiguous text span functioning as a claim or a premise in the reasoning structure.\n   - **BE HIGHLY SELECTIVE**: Only include ADUs that are crucial to the overarching argument structure.\n   - Focus on significant claims and premises that contribute meaningfully to the argumentative flow.\n   - **AVOID NOISE**: Skip ADUs that are merely descriptive, tangential, or do not substantially advance the argument.\n   - Prioritize quality over quantity - fewer accurate, important ADUs are better than many insignificant ones.\n   - **EXTRACT ONLY**: Copy text spans exactly as they appear, without any modifications.\n2. **Classify each ADU**  \n   - Label = either `\"claim\"` or `\"premise\"`.  \n3. **Detect directed relations**  \n   - Relation = `\"support\"` or `\"attack\"`, from one ADU (source) to another (target).\n   - Map how ADUs connect to form reasoning chains.\n   - Focus on relationships between the most significant ADUs.\n   - Include relationships between premises that strengthen or weaken each other.\n4. **Verbatim spans**  \n   - Each `\"text\"` value must be copied EXACTLY from the paper with zero modifications.\n   - Do not paraphrase, summarize, or combine separate sentences.\n   - Do not add, remove, or change any words, punctuation, or spacing.\n   - If unsure about exact wording, skip that ADU rather than guess.\n\n## WHAT TO CAPTURE\n**INCLUDE ONLY:**\n- Main argumentative threads that are central to the paper's contribution\n- Core claims that represent the paper's primary arguments or findings\n- Key premises that provide essential support for major claims\n- Critical counterarguments and their refutations\n- Reasoning chains that demonstrate how main conclusions are derived\n\n**EXCLUDE (AVOID NOISE):**\n- Minor details, examples, or descriptive content that don't advance the argument\n- Tangential points or side discussions\n- Pure background information or literature review content\n- Methodological details unless they constitute argumentative claims\n- Obvious statements or commonly accepted facts\n- Redundant or repetitive argumentative content\n\n**GUIDING PRINCIPLE**: If removing an ADU would not significantly impact understanding of the paper's argumentative structure, it should be excluded.\n\n## QUALITY CONTROL\n- Before finalizing each ADU, verify the text exists exactly in the source\n- Prefer fewer, accurate ADUs over many potentially modified ones\n- When in doubt about exact wording, omit the ADU\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\nReturn **only** a single valid JSON object matching this schema.  \nDo **not** output any extra text, markdown, or explanations.\nDo **not** add comments.\n**RESPOND WITH ONLY**:\n```json\n{\n  \"ADUs\": {\n    \"<ADU_ID>\": {\n      \"text\": \"<exact span from paper>\",\n      \"label\": \"claim\" | \"premise\"\n    }\n    ...\n  },\n  \"relations\": [\n    {\n      \"source\": \"<ADU_ID>\",\n      \"target\": \"<ADU_ID>\",\n      \"type\": \"support\" | \"attack\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

At first sight, the prospects of such an endeavor appear rather dim. If the numbers of the manuscripts including optical texts extant in Prague libraries are considered, Prague seems anything but a center of optical studies. Nowadays, there are only two copies of Roger Bacon's Perspectiva (MS Prague, NK ČR, VIII E 27; MS Prague, NK ČR, VIII G 19) and three copies of John Peckham's textbook Perspectiva communis (MS Prague, KMK, L 29; MS Prague, KMK, L 41; MS Prague, NK ČR, adlig. 44 E 8), i.e. rather elementary renderings of optical science; while the scientifically more rigorous Alhacen, Witelo or Euclid are entirely lacking . The 1 si  tuation was probably no better in medieval times - according to the catalogs of the late medieval libraries of Prague University colleges, recently published by F. ŠmaThe 2018 Oxfam inequality report launched for the World Economic Forum in Davos (Switzerland) highlighted the sharp increase in inequality on a global scale over the last few years. According to this report, eighty-two per cent of the wealth generated in 2017 went to the richest one per cent of the global population, while the 3.7 billion people who make up the poorest half of the world saw no increase in their wealth. 1 In the same way, authors like Branko Milanovic have pointed out that we live in the most unequal era of history, and that this is a highly globalised and interconnected phenomenon which cannot be dealt with at the national level.  The effect of the 2 world wars and the crisis of the 1920s made it possible to reduce inequality and build a social model which, at least in the developed world, allowed for the emergence of a middle class and the so-called welfare state. This model was deeply shaken first by the conservative revolution of the 1980s and, more recently, by the global crisis of 2007-2008. All of this has in turn led to the emergence of national populism, as well as an alarming increase not only in economic and geographical inequalities, but in intergenerational ones as well. For the first time in decades, today young people in\n\n3\n\n* Work on this study received financial support from the Czech Science Foundation (GA ČR) project 'Philosophy at the University of Prague around 1409: Matěj of Knín's Quodlibet as a Crossroads of European Medieval Knowledge', grant n. 19-16793S, carried out at the Institute of Philosophy of the Czech Academy of Sciences.

Further, no commentary (or even 2 glosses) to any optical text of Prague origin has been discovered to date . 3\n\nThe small number of Prague optical manuscripts is particularly notable if manuscripts  from  the  same  period  kept  in  other  Central  European  university  centers (mainly Cracow and Vienna) are considered: there are eight extant copies of Peckham's Perspectiva communis from the fourteenth to fifteenth centuries in Cracow and seven copies in Vienna . Additionally, several commentaries on Peckham originated 4 at Cracow University , and Vienna University benefited from the presence of one of 5 the most famous late medieval commentators on perspectiva , Henry of Langenstein . 6\n\nIt may seem that there is nothing to investigate in Prague, that the extant   sources are too scarce to evaluate the role of optical science at the Prague Faculty of Arts. After  all,  this  is  the  honest  surrender  taken  by  Polish  science  historian  Grażyna Rosińska in her book on optics in the fifteenth century: she admits that in the absence of manuscripts, she was not able to investigate the optical tradition at Prague University, no matter how significant it might be . 7\n\n2 See Catalogi librorum vetustissimi Universitatis Pragensis / Die ältesten Bücherkataloge der Prager Universität , eds.

I, p. 573 and Lindberg, A Catalogue , p. 31). However, this codex was most likely written in Erfurt and the question itself was disputed there around 1350 by a disciple of Themo Judaei. See J. Pinborg, 'The 14th Century schools of Erfurt. Repertorium Erfordiense', in Cahiers de l'Institut du Moyen-Âge Grec et Latin , 41 (1982), p. 186. Although the copy of Sphaera materialis included in the same codex was used by the later owner of the codex, Petrus de Dwekaczowicz called Bibat, in his lectures on the same subject in 1448 and 1450 (see Truhl/u00E1.a/u0159.a, Catalogus , vol. I, p. 573), the perspectivist quaestio , as far as I know, had no significant influence on the Prague intellectual milieu. An edition of this quaestio is  under preparation by Jean Celeyrette, see J. Celeyre/t\\_t.ae, 'Une question de perspective disputée à Erfurt partiellement copiée sur une question d'Oresme', in Noctua , 5 (2019), p. 125-179.\n\nFurther, I discovered hitherto unknown anonymous questions on perspectiva in MS Prague, KMK, M 100, fols 69rb-72rb (I am preparing a new description of the codex and edition of the questions).

H. Steneck, Science and Creation in the Middle Ages: Henry of Langenstein (d. 1397) on Genesis , Notre Dame, University of Notre Dame Press, 1976, p. 9-22, for his tenets in optics and theory of light see p. 42-52.\n\n7 Rosi/u0144.aska, Optyka w XV wieku , p. 17-18.\n\nThe main aim of the present paper is to point out that efforts to investigate perspectiva in the context of late medieval Prague University are not so vain. As counting optical manuscripts kept in a local library is now neither the only nor the best way to judge the dissemination of perspectiva in this place in the later Middle Ages, I  suggest  other  ways  to  deal  with  the  issue  and  argue  that  there  are  other  types of sources to be considered. Therefore, section I inquires into studying optics at the Prague Faculty of Arts, highlighting both the faculty statutes and students' lists of the lectures actually attended. Also, it argues for a certain knowledge of optics among a considerable number of university members at least since the 1370s, by pointing to two lectures or commentaries (a philosophical one by Jenek of Prague and a theological one by Conrad of Soltau) whose authors assumed an acquaintance with perspectiva among their listeners. Section II draws attention to a type of source which - despite its arguable fruitfulness - has been under-investigated by historians of science: Prague quodlibetal disputations (1390s - 1410s), or the handbooks prepared by masters presiding over the quodlibets ( quodlibetarii ) and the elaborated positiones of the responding masters. Even a brief look at these texts reveals the acquaintance of the participants with optical auctoritates (e.g.  the  preparation of Simon of Tišnov [Šimon z Tišnova in Czech]). Finally, section III, the most extensive, represents the core of the paper and brings a thorough analysis of the question on the mechanism of vision ( Utrum sensationes fiunt per extramissiones virtutum ab organis sensitivis ) disputed by the Bohemian master John of Borotín (Iohannes de Borotin, 1378 - after 1458) in John Hus's quodlibet in 1411. The manuscript preservation of the question and its formal structure, as well as Borotín's sources and doctrinal position, are scrutinized. Borotín's question evinces that its author mastered John Peckham's textbook Perspectiva communis and adopted Peckham's view on the mechanism of vision, proposing a position intromissionist in general but also involving a kind of extramission. The paper also has two appendices - the first provides a description of part of MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 18 preserving Borotín's question, while Appendix II is a critical edition of the question.\n\n## 1. Studying Optics at the Prague Faculty of Arts\n\nFirst, it is worth premising what medieval optics is about. A marginal gloss in one of  the  Prague  manuscripts  of  Peckham's Perspectiva  communis introduces  a  brief definition of the discipline: 'Optics is a doctrinal science about light, colors and 'aspects' .' First, 8 perspectiva is called a 'doctrinal science' . In the Middle Ages, 'doctrinal sciences' are those abstracting away from the specific physical realization of the  object  under  consideration;  roughly,  mathematical  studies  -  besides  optics, arithmetic, geometry, or astronomy - are counted among them . They investigate 9\n\n8 Iohannes Peckham, Perspectiva communis , MS Prague, KMK, L 29, fol. 21r, in mg. sup. : 'Perspectiva est lucium, colorum et aspectuum doctrinalis sciencia.'\n\n9 See, e.g., Isidorus Hispalensis, Etymologiarum sive Originum libri XX , 2 vols, ed. W. M. Lindsay, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1911, III. Prol.; sometimes, the term 'scientia disciplinalis' is used; see Domini-\n\nsome features of nature (such as the propagation of light, its reflection or refraction in optics), but only insofar as they can be described using geometry. More Aristotelian classifications subsume optics (along with astronomy and harmonics) under the so-called 'middle sciences' ( scientiae mediae ) belonging both to mathematics and natural philosophy 10 .  Second,  the  gloss  determines  the  object  of  optics  -  it studies not only light and colors but also aspectus ,  i.e.  the  appearances  of  things (hence, some optical texts and the whole science are sometimes called 'de aspectibus'). In other words, medieval optics is not only a physics of the propagation of light but also an investigation of the physiological and even psychological processes behind visual acts. Hence, the scope of medieval perspectiva is considerably larger than that of present-day optics: whereas nowadays optics is a physical science about light and its properties, medieval optics is a conglomerate of physical, geometrical, physiological and even psychological inquiries 11 .\n\nThe blossoming of the perspectiva in Latin Europe came in the thirteenth century. Then, optics was one of the new sciences and was, as Roger Bacon says, both semi  nal for a knowledge of nature and neglected by his contemporaries 12 . Indeed, a full-fledged mastering of the optical science was scarce until the mid-thirteenth century. By that time, all of the important Greek and Arabic renderings of the discipline (i.e. works by Euclid, Ptolemy, Al-Kindi and especially Ibn al-Haytham, or Alhacen) had already been translated into Latin, and the discipline was assimilated and rendered into the context of Latin learning thanks to figures such as Roger Bacon, John Peckham and Witelo, who all authored textbooks or compendia of the optical science 13 .\n\nThereafter, perspectiva was  gradually  incorporated  into  the  curriculum  of philosophy studies at the studia of  some religious orders and faculties of arts 14 .\n\ncus Gundissalinus, De divisione philosophiae , ed. L. Baur, Münster, Aschendorff, 1903, prol., p. 15. The opposite of 'doctrinal' is a 'natural science' .\n\n10  See, e.g., Benedictus Hesse de Cracovia, Quaestiones disputatae super tres libros De anima Aristotelis (written in c. 1420s), MS Cracow, BJ, 2013, fols 8v-9r, cited by M. Markowski, Burydanizm w Polsce w okresie przedkopernikańskim , Wrocław, Ossolineum, 1971, p. 86: '[…] astronomia, perspectiva, musica […] aliqualiter participant de mathematica et aliqualiter de philosophia naturali, et ergo dicuntur sciencie medie inter mathematicam et philosophiam naturalem sicud […] perspectiva considerat de linea visuali, modo linea pertinet ad mathematicam sed visus ad naturalem.' For Hesse's sophisticated division of the sciences, see Markowski, Burydanizm w Polsce w okresie przedkopernikańskim , p. 53-56.\n\n11 See A. M. Smith, 'What is the History of Medieval Optics Really About?', in Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society , 148-2 (2004), p. 180-194, who argues that whereas modern optics is 'luminocentric', the pre-modern one was rather 'oculocentric' .\n\n12 Rogerius Bacon, 'Opus tertium', in Fr. Rogeri Bacon Opera quaedam hactenus inedita ,  vol. II, ed. J. S. Brewer, London, Longman, Green, Longman, and Roberts, 1859, p. 36-38.\n\n13 On the contributions of these three authors see D. C. Lindberg, Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler , Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1976, p. 107-121 or A. M. Smith, From Sight to Light: The Passage from Ancient to Modern Optics , Chicago / London, The University of Chicago Press, 2015, p. 260-277.\n\n14 Although it is neglected in this paper, the domain of perspectiva is not restricted only to the university milieu. As early as the late thirteenth century, perspectiva became a popular source for preachers. The moral dimensions of optical science are epitomized in the famous preaching manual De oculo morali by Peter of Limoges (written around 1280). This treatise was based on a careful study of Roger Bacon's Per-\n\nInterestingly, historians of science often mention that the earliest record in any university statutes to obligatory lectures on optics is, in fact, from Prague 15 . In the dean's book ( Liber decanorum ) of the Arts faculty, there is a statute enumerating which lectures a bachelor of arts must attend to be eligible for the master's exam. Lectures on Perspectiva communis (which is the most suitable for beginners of all the perspectivist texts) are included among other works from the fields of mathematics and astronomy 16 . This prescription is often dated 1390, like the entire Liber spectiva and original deduction of moral analogies and instructions from optical issues. On the place of De oculo morali in the perspectivist tradition see R. Newhauser, 'Inter Scientiam et Populum: Roger Bacon, Pierre de Limoges and the Tractatus moralis de oculo', in J. A. Aertsen, K. Emery, A. Speer (eds.), After the Condemnation of 1277. Philosophy and Theology at the University of Paris in the Last Quarter of the Thirteenth Century , Berlin / New York, De Gruyter, 2001, p. 682-703 or D. G. Denery, Seeing and Being Seen in the Later Medieval World. Optics, Theology and Religious Life , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. 75-115.\n\nAlthough written at the University of Paris, it soon gained widespread dissemination outside universities and became a true medieval bestseller: there are more than 200 extant manuscripts of this text (Newhauser, 'Inter Scientiam et Populum', p. 688-689). It was obviously also read in the Bohemian lands. Even a quick look into the catalogs reveals a considerable number of copies of De oculo morali - e.g. in MSS Prague, NK ČR, I B 15; IV C 1; V C 10; VIII E 25; X B 24; XI C 8; XIV E 25; Prague, KMK, F 115; MSS Olomouc, Sbírka rukopisů Metropolitní kapituly u sv. Václava v Olomouci, CO 215; Olomouc, Vědecká knihovna, M II 79. There is also a copy of Bohemian origin now kept in Uppsala (MS Uppsala, Universitetsbiblioteket, C 641) which, according to its explicit, was written in Prague in the 1370s (note that the scribe was uncertain about the authorship and ascribed it to Thomas Bradwardine): 'Explicit tractatus de oculo morali a doctore profundo magistro thoma Brabd bradbardeyn ut fertur finitus prage anno domini MCCC septuagesimo 4°.' (MS Uppsala, Universitetsbiblioteket, C 641, fol. 57r, cited by M. Andersson-Schmi/t\\_t.a, H. Hallberg, M. Hedlund, Mittelalterliche Handschriften der Universitätsbibliothek Uppsala. Katalog über die C-Sammlung , 6 vols, Stockholm, Almqvist &amp; Wiksell International, 1988-1993, vol. 6, p. 192, where the codex is also described.) It is highly probable that a future edition of Prague homiletical works will uncover at least some optical hints in the sermons, likely influenced by Peter of Limoges.\n\n- 15 See Lindberg, Theories of Vision , p. 121; Smith, From Sight to Light , p. 280-281.\n- 16 Statuta et Acta rectorum Universitatis Carolinae Pragensis 1360-1614 , ed. F. Šmahel, G. Silagi, Praha, Karo  linum, 2018, p. 243 (II. 27): 'Statutum fuit […] quod nullus magistrorum de facultate nostra, qui pro examinatore magistrandorum fuerit deputatus, aliquem ad tentamen admittat, nisi complete audiverit  libros  infra  scriptos,  videlicet  omnes  libros  Maioris  physice,  logicam  Aristotelis,  Ethicorum, Politicorum, Economicorum, sex libros Euclidis, [Iohannis de Sacrobosco] Spheram, [Campani Novariensis] Theoricam [planetarum], aliquid in musica et arismetica, Perspectivam communem [Iohannis de Peckham], De sensu et sensato, De somno et vigilia.' I split the phrase 'Spheram theoricam' into the two different astronomical works. See also Statuta et Acta rectorum Universitatis Carolinae Pragensis , p. 256 (V. 29), where it is stated that the lectures on Perspectiva communis should be conducted weekly for at least three months, but no longer than 14 weeks; and Statuta et Acta rectorum Universitatis Carolinae Pragensis , p. 260 (V. 40), where Perspectiva communis is listed among books that ought not to be taught on feast days.\n\nInterestingly, the Prague statutes are much more specific regarding mathematical (or quadrivial) disciplines than, e. g., the Parisian ones. A Parisian statute from 1366 includes only a general mention that a student striving for the license is required to attend lectures on 'some mathematical books' ( Chartularium Universitatis Parisiensis , 4 vols, eds. H. Denifle, A. Chatelain, Paris, Delalain, 1889-1897, vol. III, p. 145). In an older prescription, it is given more precisely that the bachelor should have attended 'at least a hundred lectures on maths' which means, e. g., 'one entire mathematical book, such as the treatise On sphere' completed and 'another book in progress' ( Chartularium , vol. II, p. 678).\n\ndecanorum ;  however,  what  is  called Liber  decanorum today  is  actually  a  'new' book created by then dean Matthias of Legnica, who also included older materials there 17 . As F. Šmahel points out, the statute article prescribing obligatory lectures on perspectiva is actually from the earliest stratum of the Liber decanorum, and its terminus ante quem is 1366 18 .\n\nHence, perspectiva might have been taught in Prague from at least the 1360s. Does a statute as a normative statement, though, entitle us to infer anything about actual practice? Obviously, further evidence is needed. A proof that attending optical  lectures was common practice among bachelors of arts can be gained from two lists of lectures attended by Prague students in the late 1380s 19 .  According to these, both students attended lectures on Peckham's Perspectiva communis delivered by Frederick of Drosendorf. The first student attended lectures on Perspectiva concurrently with lectures on Euclid and Theorica planetarum (all  three delivered by Drosendorf) 20 . The second student first heard lectures on the 2 nd and 3 rd books of Perspectiva communis (on  seeing by reflection and refraction, mirrors, lenses and some atmospheric phenomena), and only later lectures on the 1  book (on light, st anatomy and physiology of the visual organ, visual process and its condition and illusions) 21 .  Again, Drosendorf delivered all the lectures. However, since Drosendorf earned his master's degree in 1387 (and his performance at the exams was not particularly compelling), the quality and originality of his lectures on perspectiva delivered a year or two later is doubtful at best 22 .\n\nAnother testimony to Prague lectures on perspectiva is more than a decade older (and arguably the oldest one known today) - in a manuscript once kept in Halberstadt, a copy of Peckham's Perspectiva communis was accompanied by an explicit\n\n17 See Lindberg and Smith cited above (n. 15); on replacing the oldest book by Liber decanorum see F.

Possibly, the second student wanted to combine his classes thematically - he attended lectures on Aristotle's Meteorology concurrently with the lectures on Perspectiva communis II-III (at least partially) and on Aristotle's De sensu et sensato simultaneously with the lecture on Perspectiva communis I.\n\n22 See Šmahel, Die Prager Universität im Mittelalter , p. 325; for Drosendorf in Prague see also J. T/u0159.a/u00ED.a/u0161.aka, 'Příspěvky k středověké literární universitě I [Contributions to the Medieval Literary University I]', in Acta Universitatis Carolinae - Historia Universitatis Carolinae Pragensis , 9-1 (1968), p. 21. In the 1390s, we find Drosendorf in Vienna, studying medicine and teaching mathematical disciplines at the local university. He lectured on Perspectiva communis twice and on Proportiones breves , the abbreviation of Bradwardine's De proportionibus . See S. G/u00FC.anther, Geschichte des mathematischen Unterrichts im deutschen Mittelalter bis zum Jahre 1525 , Berlin, A. Hofmann &amp; Comp., 1887, p. 198-199. Later, he gained fame as the 'astrologer of Austria' and organized a disputation upon the appearance of the comet in 1402. He died in 1404. See M. H. Shank, 'Academic Consulting in Fifteenth-Century Vienna: The Case of Astrology', in E. Sylla, M.

The codex also included an optical treatise on the rainbow, but unfortunately, it is most likely lost today 24 .\n\nAnother, more indirect proof that Prague masters (and their students) were acquainted with optics in this early period are references to perspectivist texts made by them in lectures or commentaries on other works. The assumption here is that if a master refers to a perspectivist work or doctrine, he must know it, and it is also understandable to, and easily traceable and verifiable by, his listeners (as they have access to these texts in a library or have attended lectures on the issue). Two examples of such references can be introduced here - both texts are from the 1370s, to which the earliest evidence of optical lectures can be dated.\n\nThe first example is found in the commentary on De anima by Jenek of Prague (Jenco Wenceslai de Praga), usually dated 1375 25 . The references to optics are in the exposition of a passage in De anima II where Aristotle mentions kinds of objects which do not have any specific color in light, but which still appear luminous in darkness (he gives the examples of fungi or the scales or eyes of fish) 26 . This claim, however, seems to contradict the common Aristotelian conviction that what is seen is primarily the color and not the light. Commenting on this passage, Jenko first states that the issue pertains to the practitioners of perspectiva ( ad perspectivos pertinet ). He refers to Alhacen, whose explanation is that a more intense light somehow 'covers' the less intense one. A consequence is that a remote candle or stars are not visible in the daylight, but they are easily visible at night 27 .  Jenek  here evidently\n\n23  MS  Halberstadt,  Domgymnasium,  MS  217;  the  explicit,  cited  by  the  catalog  (G.  Schmidt,  'Die Handschriften  der  Gymnasial-Bibliothek  II',  in Königliches  Dom-Gymnasium  zu  Halberstadt.  Oster-Programm 1881 , Halberstadt, 1881, p. 20), is as follows: 'Finita est hec perspectiva communis magistri Johanis de Pysa anno Domini m.xxx.lxxiiij, in die s. Frederici imperatoris in honoranda universitate Pragensi, in domo medici imperatoris, per Allexium de Wratislavia, hora quinta decima.' This explicit has already been used by Šmahel, Die Prager Universität im Mittelalter , p. 107-108, 136 as proof that the lectures of the Prague Faculty of Medicine might initially have been delivered in the houses of royal doctors.\n\n24 The likely loss of the codex was suggested by Dr. Patrizia Carmassi (Herzog August Bibliothek, Wolfenbüttel) who was responsible for new cataloging of Halberstadt manuscripts, in an e-mail conversation from April 2017.\n\n25 On Jenek see P.

The date (or, at least, a terminus ante quem ) is based on the explicit of the commentary in MS Prague, NK ČR, VIII G 30, fol. 109r.\n\n26 Aristoteles, De anima II,  7,  419a1-7,  cf.  also  Averroes, Commentarium magnum in Aristotelis de ani  ma libros , ed.

Perspectivist influences are usually concentrated in one particular place in Sentences commentaries - the thirteenth distinction of book II, devoted to the issue of creation of light. Theologians had here an opportunity to show their proficiency in optics, dealing with such issues as the nature of light, its propagation, colors and so on 30 . In his rather brief treatment of the question, Soltau refers four times to optical science or directly to Peckham's Perspectiva communis (in one case, he even makes an exact reference to a specific proposition of Peckham's) 31 .\n\nHowever, does Soltau not borrow these references from another source? After all, his commentary is significantly influenced by the corresponding work of Thom-\n\nhec in tenebris sunt visibilia alia racio est, i.e. ad perspectivos pertinet, qui dicunt, quia sunt luminosa unde generaliter vel videntur tamquam proprium sensibile a visu nisi color et lumen, de die autem non videntur, quia lumen maius occultat multa visibilia que minus lucent, oportet per Alacen. Eciam lumen minus non videtur in lumine maiori secundum perspectivos. Est causa: sicud sonus maior ocultat minorem, sic lumen maius ocultat minus. Hec eciam est causa, quare candela de nocte accensa videtur a remotis et non de die et quare stelle apparent de nocte et non de die.'\n\n28 Cf. Alhacen, 'De aspectibus, I-III', ed. A. M. Smith, in A. M. Smith, Alhacen's Theory of Visual Perception , Philadelphia, American Philosophical Society, 2001, I. 2, §4. 8 and 4. 10, p. 5-6. A similar solution was also proposed in the Buridanian tradition of De anima commentaries. See (Pseudo-)Iohannes Buridanus, 'Expositio De anima', ed. B. Patar, in B. Patar, Le Traité de l'âme de Jean Buridan [De prima lectura].

Patar, Nicolai Oresme Expositio et quaestiones in Aristotelis De anima , Louvain / Paris, Éditions Peeters, 1995, II. 4, 1, p. 42-43; however, none of them mentions perspectiva in this passage, which renders the possibility that Jenek just borrowed the reference from another commentary unlikely. Note that Buridan's authorship of the exposition of De anima edited and ascribed to him by B. Patar has recently been seriously contested - see S. W. De Boer, P. J. J. Bakker, 'Is John Buridan the Author of the Anonymous Traité de l' âme Edited by Benoît Patar?', in Bulletin de philosophie médiévale , 53 (2011), p. 283-332. I therefore refer to the text as by pseudo -Buridan.\n\n- 29 On Conrad of Soltau see T/u0159.a/u00ED.a/u0161.aka, 'Příspěvky I' , p. 14; J.

On the one hand, Conrad evidently draws his inspiration from Thomas of Strasbourg in dividing the distinction into four articuli 33 ; he also shares Thomas's stance in all four cases (in one instance with an explicit reference to him) 34 .  Nevertheless, with one exception (different from Conrad), Thomas does not refer  to  optics  or  Peckham. Even if Conrad's rendering of the question was a mere abbreviation of the one by Thomas, then, Conrad's perspectivist hints would be his own 35 .  It may thus be concluded that writing his commentary  on Sentences ,  Conrad  of  Soltau  was  equipped  with  certain  optical knowledge and might count on the same among his listeners.\n\nTo summarize, the optical texts (chiefly Peckham, but perhaps also Alhacen) were known to Prague masters and students as early as in the 1370s - lectures on optics were delivered then, and the tenets of the discipline were referred to in both philosophical and theological texts.\n\n## 2. Discussing Optics in Prague Quodlibets (c. 1394-1417)\n\nAlthough acquaintance with perspectiva among the members of Prague University is already attested in the 1370s, there is substantially richer evidence of optical knowledge in Prague from the 1390s to the beginning of the Hussite Wars - namely, Prague quodlibetal disputations that took place at the Faculty of Arts 36 . As the questions on optics-related issues are rather numerous, this section is selective 37 . It  lists  the optical questions disputed in the quodlibets, briefly summarizes their topics, and focuses on how this kind of source can be utilized as evidence for the dissemination of perspectiva in the Prague University milieu (on the example of a question included in the quodlibet by Simon of Tišnov). As the rest of the paper is devoted to the question on vision disputed by John of Borotín in the 1411 quodlibet chaired by John Hus, Hus's preparation for the disputation with Borotín is briefly considered here, and its Wycliffian source is uncovered.\n\n32 Schabel, Brinzei, Maga, 'A Golden Age of Theology at Prague', p. 32.\n\n33 Compare Conrad's text with Thomas de Argentina, Commentaria in IV libros Sententiarum , Venice, Iordanus Ziletti, 1564, II. 13, fols 155rb-156va.\n\n34 Conradus de Soltau, Sent. II. 13, MS Prague, NK ČR, I D 23, fols 72vb-73ra: 'Quantum ad 2 m articulum dicit Tomas de Argentina quod non sunt eiusdem nature lumen vel lux corporum celestium et istorum inferiorum […].'\n\n35 E.g. Conrad's solution of the 4 th article is (contrary to that of Thomas) a mere statement that the issue is already solved in perspectiva .\n\n36 The fact that perspectiva remained an obligatory part of the university curriculum even after the secession of the German masters in 1409 is attested by a brief mention made by John Hus in his Quodlibet . Hus, introducing the young master Elias de Tyn (who had earned his master's degree in 1410), stresses that Elias had devoted himself to study of perspectiva recently. See Iohannes Hus, Quodlibet ,  ed. B. Ryba, Turnhout, Brepols, 2006, q. 52, p. 240-241: '[…] Magister E&lt;lias&gt; de T&lt;yn&gt; […] illi sciencie [scil.  perspective]  hoc  anno  specialiter  in  leccione  deditus,  scolas  nostras  in  hac  materia  clarissime informabit.'\n\n37 The author of this paper is preparing another study devoted precisely to the issue of perspectiva in Prague quodlibets.\n\nFirst,  it  is  worth  emphasizing  that  the  Prague  quodlibets  differ  substantially from the traditional ones in several aspects 38 . The traditional quodlibets (from the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries) were organized at theological faculties or the studia of different religious orders. A prominent theologian (deputized by his bachelor) had to answer whatever question was put by any member of the academic community, and then face counter-arguments to his solution. After this first part of the disputation, the master reorganized the questions according to similarities in their topics, summarized the discussions and stated his position on each of the questions (this elaborated version of his positions was called the determinatio ), and introduced it to the community several days later. After that, he sometimes refined his text into a final version intended for distribution ( ordinatio ) 39 . Thus, traditional quodlibets are often original and profound texts produced by the best scholars at the peak of their careers.\n\nBy contrast, the Prague quodlibets were instead a collaborative enterprise. The quodlibets we have evidence for were held at the Faculty of Arts .  The role of the master organizing the session was radically different: he did not answer the questions, but put them. The quodlibetarius had to prepare a question for each master of the faculty (often regarding the field of expertise of the latter) and then present counter-arguments against the latter's solution. Thus, the quodlibetarius prepared a handbook of these questions, including several counter-arguments against both positive and negative solutions to each question (as he did not know which of the options the responding master would choose, the quodlibetarius had to prepare for any of them). Since positiones of the responding masters are rather rarely extant, the actual handbooks of the quodlibetarii (or  rather copies of them) are the best source we have for the study of the Prague quodlibets. Obviously, in this case, we confront a specific kind of source. These preparations often do not include any con-\n\n38 For quodlibets (both as specific disputation sessions organized at medieval universities and studia and as a special kind of written sources) in general see J.

Moreover, the quodlibetarius might help himself by copying the preparation from another kind of source (see Hus below). However, when the preparation is not copied down word for word, it may still reveal what sources the quodlibetarius had at his disposal when he was preparing for the disputation (see Simon of Tišnov below).\n\nToday, no less than fourteen quodlibetarii from the period between 1394 and 1417 are known at least by name 40 .  Further, there are extant handbooks by seven of them: Henry of Ribenice (1394?), Matthias of Legnica (1399?), John Arsen of Langenfeld (1400?), Matthias of Knín (1409), John Hus (1411), Simon of Tišnov (1416) and Prokop of Kladruby (1417). Each of their handbooks is preserved in a single manuscript, and they have not yet been edited except for the handbook by Hus edited by Bohumil Ryba.\n\nWhen the lists of questions from of all of these quodlibets are examined 41 , no less than 13 questions relating explicitly to optics may be identified. All the quodlibetarii (except Arsen) included at least one perspectivist question in their handbooks:\n\n## Henry of Ribenice (MS Leipzig, Universitätsbibliothek, Ms 1414)\n\n- (1)  q. 48: Utrum radius visualis frangatur in occursu medii rarioris seu densioris\n\n## Matthias of Legnica (MS Stralsund, Stadtarchiv, Hs 1067, fols 207r-279r)\n\n- (2)  q. 85: Utrum visio facta sub pyramide radiosa fiat extra mittendo vel recipiendo\n\n## Matthias of Knín (MS Prague, KMK, L 45)\n\n- (3)  q. 37: Utrum species qualitatum per se sensibilium existat in medio realiter et subiective\n- (4) q. 72 (73): Utrum demonstrabile est iridem tantum tricolorem peripheriam circuli apparere\n- (5)  q. 114 (116): Utrum visio facta sub pyramide radiosa fiat intus suscipiendo vel extramittendo\n- (6)  q.  137  (140): Utrum multiplicatio luminis per medium uniforme sit uniformiter difformis\n\n40 The list of all known quodlibets, extant manuscripts and literature on each of them is in Šmahel, Die Prager Universität im Mittelalter , p. 377-381. Besides the quodlibets listed by Šmahel, I found what seems to be another Prague quodlibet in two Cracow manuscripts - in MS Cracow, BJ, 649 and (slightly abbreviated) in MS Cracow, BJ, 624 (which also preserves several abbreviated questions from Ribenice's quodlibet ). Arguably, both codices are of Prague origin, include a set of questions on various topics with problemata and a discussion on the quaestio principalis . Both codices can be dated to before 1400 on the basis of watermarks. They are described in M. Kowalczyk et al., Catalogus codicum manuscriptorum medii aevi latinorum qui in Bibliotheca Jagellonica Cracoviae asservantur , 9 vols, Wrocław, Ossolineum, 1980-2008, vol. IV, p. 338-343, 398-406.\n\n41 For lists of questions see Kej/u0159.a, Kvodlibetní disputace , p. 116-169 (Knín, Hus, Tišnov, Prokop of Kladruby); J.

Two questions are dedicated to specific optical phenomena, namely the rainbow and mirror images (nos. 4 and 12). Whereas Knín prepared a question on whether there can be demonstrative science about the rainbow 42 , Prokop of Kladruby deals with the metaphysical nature of the images appearing in mirrors. Both gather arguments about the metaphysical nature of these phenomena: are they qualities existing in a full-fledged way, or mere appearances with somewhat diminished extramental existence?\n\nOther questions deal with human vision and the eyes (no. 7 and 10): Hus wanted to discuss the Aristotelian definition of vision; Tišnov prepared a fascinating question on the conditions of vision, apparently deeply influenced by perspectivist authors (see below). Finally, the mechanism of vision - i.e. whether an observer sees by intromission (receiving stimuli) or extramission (emitting something from\n\n42 Of all the questions listed above, Knín's seems to be the only one which has been studied by a modern scholar. See Koc/u00E1.anov/u00E1.a, 'The Sublunary Phaenomena' , p. 77-78.\n\nhis eyes) - figures prominently in four of these six handbooks (nos. 2, 5, 9, and 13.) The question disputed by Borotín is one of them.\n\nSome of these questions are Aristotelian both by their topic and the sources quoted in them 43 .  As for the perspectivist authors, the most quoted is, unsurprisingly, John Peckham; some quodlibetarii also refer to Alhacen. Nevertheless, in the context of tracing perspectivist influences, there is one interesting preparation with no counterpart in any known Prague quodlibet - that proposed by Simon of Tišnov (no. 10) 44 .\n\nThe question's title already reveals an apparent familiarity with perspectiva .  It asks whether there are eight conditions to be met for vision to be veridical - a standard issue in perspectivist literature 45 . When introducing these conditions, Simon of Tišnov even refers directly to Alhacen's De aspectibus and enumerates that for vision to be veridical, the object must be remote from and opposite the eyes, illuminated, and of a proper quantity and density, while the air must be transparent and the eye healthy, and a moment of time is needed 46 .\n\nFurthermore,  Tišnov's  preparation  includes  the  most  significant  number  of references to perspectivist texts of all the quodlibetal questions mentioned. I have counted 31 references in total; not only to the Peckham's textbook but also to texts known rather to specialists in optical science:\n\n| Peckham, Perspectiva communis   |   17 | Bacon, Perspectiva      |   2 |\n|---------------------------------|------|-------------------------|-----|\n| Alhacen, De aspectibus          |    8 | Euclid, De visu         |   1 |\n| Witelo, Perspectiva             |    2 | Al-Kindi, De aspectibus |   1 |\n\nReferences to Peckham 47 and Alhacen are direct - to a concrete proposition or chapter, which may indicate that Tišnov had these texts in front of his eyes. Two references to Bacon are interesting: the first is very vague (Bacon is just a name in a list of perspectivists) 48 , while the second comprises two pieces of text quoted by Tišnov and ascribed to 'someone writing about natural philosophy' ( quidam naturaliter\n\n43 As further research will probably reveal, some of them are derived from Aristotelian commentaries on, e.g., De sensu et sensato or Meteorologica .\n\n44 Simon de Tissnow, Quodlibet , MS Prague, Knihovna Národního muzea, V C 42, q. 46, fols 131v-133v.\n\n45 See Alhacen, De aspectibus III, 3, §3.1-3, p. 285; Rogerius Bacon, 'Perspectiva', in D.

Lindberg (ed.), John Pecham and the Science of Optics , Madison / Milwaukee / London, University of Wisconsin Press, 1970, I. 47 (50) - 54 (57), p. 130-134.\n\n46 Simon de Tissnow, Quodlibet ,  q.  46,  MS  Prague,  Knihovna  Národního  muzea,  V  C  42,  fol.  131v: 'Quod questio sit vera pro quesito, arguitur auctoritate Alhacen 3  libro sue o Perspective , capitulo 3 quod intitulatur 'capitulum de causis, quibus visui accidit decepcio', sic dicentis: quibus completur comprehensio visi, secundum quod est, sunt octo: remocio, opposicio, lux, quantitas, corporis densitas, dyafaneitas aeris, tempus, sanitas visus. Hiis ergo omnibus aggregatis visum comprehenditur vera visione.'\n\n47 Peckham is cited as 'Pisanus', which is a common mistake in late medieval manuscripts.\n\n48 Simon de Tissnow, Quodlibet , q. 46, MS Prague, Knihovna Národního muzea, V C 42, fol. 132r: '[…] maior patet ex primo Perspective Alhacen et Pisani et omnium Perspectivistarum, Bacon&lt;is&gt; et Vitellonis etc.'\n\nscribens ) 49 . Al-Kindi is quoted once as a proponent of an Aristotelian position unusual among the perspectivists - that light spreads out in an instant and hence what we see, we see immediately 50 .  As for the arguments, the preparation seems to be written by somebody well-versed in state-of-the-art perspectivist works 51 .\n\nDespite poor manuscript evidence, as stated in the introduction, some of the Prague quodlibetal questions - and primarily that by Simon of Tišnov - testify to not negligible degrees of knowledge of perspectiva 52 . Tišnov's question, though, - no matter how interesting - remains a preparation for discussion (and it is not even certain that it was really discussed during the quodlibetal session). As mentioned, the only optics-related question where both the preparation by the quodlibetarius and the positio by the responding master are extant is Borotín's question on the mechanism of vision proposed to him by John Hus. Since the rest of the paper is devoted to Borotín's positio ,  this section ends with a brief look at Hus's preparation for this question and its sources 53 .\n\nHus's preparation for the question of whether sensations are by sensory powers being emitted is rather brief and sketchy. Although several arguments both neganti and concedenti are gathered, all the arguments are ultimately for extramission. The first group of arguments is designed for a situation in which Borotín denies extramission ( neganti ) and defend a kind of syncretic account combining extramission with intromission. The second group is prepared for the case that Borotín accepts intromission ( concedenti, quod fit intus suscipiendo ) - and is thus against intromission, defending extramission again. Obviously, Hus counted on Borotín's acceptance of the much more common intromissionist view 54 .\n\nAs Hus's preparation is strongly derivative, it is interesting to trace his sources. Although one expects a commentary on De sensu or a perspectivist work as a chief\n\n49 Simon de Tissnow, Quodlibet , q. 46, MS Prague, Knihovna Národního muzea, V C 42, fol. 132v: 'In oppositum arguitur et primo contra supposita et primo, quia questio supponit quod oculus componitur ex quattuor tunicis. Contra hoc arguitur sic: non est compositus oculus ex quattuor tunicis, igitur illud primum suppositum questionis est falsum. […] Hoc idem patet auctoritate cuiusdam naturaliter scribentis circa materiam de oculis, questione 2é capitulo 2 , sic dicentis: 'Oculus autem habet tres o tunicas seu panniculos et tres humores et unam telam ad modum tele aranee [= Bacon, Perspectiva I, 2, 2, p. 26] . ' Et in eodem capitulo circa finem dicit: ' Aliqui eciam VII tunicas posuerunt, sed falsum est, quia telam araneam pro tunica computaverunt [= Bacon, Perspectiva I. 2, 2, p. 28]. ''\n\n50 On the context of the medieval debate see D. C. Lindberg, 'Medieval Latin Theories of the Speed of Light', in R. Taton (ed.), Roemer et la vitesse de la lumière , Paris, Vrin, 1978, p. 45-72.\n\n51 The profundity and originality of this preparation are also surprising, as Tišnov's quodlibet is traditionally supposed to be heavily influenced by earlier quodlibetal handbooks. Cf. Kej/u0159.a, Kvodlibetní disputace , p. 97-101; Šmahel, Die Prager Universität im Mittelalter , p. 369 counts 15 questions copied from Knín's quodlibet by Tišnov.\n\n52 Besides optics-oriented questions, references to perspectivist authorities also appear in other questions on different topics. For example, Zdeněk of Labouň (Zdenko de Labun) in the question debated in Hus's quodlibet explains some optical phenomena such as the rainbow or halo as a result of refraction of sunlight in the atmosphere and refers several times to the Perspectiva by Witelo, i.e. to a highly technical compendium of optics. Unlike Tišnov's vague reference to Witelo, Labouň refers to specific propositions, which may indicate that he has the text before his eyes. See Zdenko de Labun, 'Questio astronomicalis', ed. B. Koc/u00E1.anov/u00E1.a, in ead., 'Questio astronomicalis Zdeňka z Labouně: Kritická edice [Questio astronomicalis by Zdeněk of Labouň: A Critical Edition]', in Listy filologické , 139 (2016), §3.7, p. 158-159.\n\n53 The preparation is edited in Iohannes Hus, Quodlibet , q. 56, p. 254-256.\n\n54 As will be scrutinized below, Borotín accepted a syncretic account in the end.\n\nsource for such a question, Hus is faithful to his favorite thinker John Wyclif even here and borrows a considerable portion of the text from Wyclif's theological masterpiece Trialogus , namely from a chapter on sensation in the first anthropological part of the work 55 . On the other hand, it is not so surprising if one takes into consideration both Wyclif's intense interest in the science of perspectiva 56 and the popularity of Wyclif's works among reformist Bohemian masters (concentrated around John Hus and Jerome of Prague) 57 .\n\nThus, even the title of Hus's question prepared for Borotín is borrowed from Wyclif:\n\n| Iohannes Hus, Quodlibet , q. 56 58                                                                                                                                                                                           | Iohannes Wyclif, Trialogus , II, 7 59                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| […] Hanc autem difficultatem […] Magister Io<hannes> de B<orotin> […] nostro auditorio declarabit.

Hus's first argument (inspired by the second part of Wyclif's text) asserts that vision itself is on the intersection of an extension of the (imaginary) visual ray and cathetus , i.e., a line drawn through the object perpendicular to the surface of the mirror (The perspectivist dictum used here pertains to the issue of the location of the mirror images; unlike Wyclif, Hus mentions the context of mirror perception only at the very end of the argument). As the intersection is (usually) behind the mirror and hence outside the eyes, Hus's concludes that vision must be by extramission 60 .\n\n55 Iohannes Wyclif, Trialogus, cum Supplemento Trialogi ,  ed. G. Lechler, Oxford, Clarendon, 1869, II. 7,  p.  97-98.  Note  that  although  Hus's  dependence  on Trialogus in  q.  56  is  unnoticed  by  editor B. Ryba, he identifies several borrowings from Wyclif's Opus evangelicum in q. 52 (on the multiplication of light). See Iohannes Hus, Quodlibet , q. 52, p. 240-246.\n\n56 Copious evidence is provided by H. Phillips, 'John Wyclif and the Optics of the Eucharist', in A. Hudson, M. Wilks (eds.), From Ockham to Wyclif , Oxford / New York, Basil Blackwell, 1987, p. 245-258.\n\n57 On the dissemination of Wyclif's works in Bohemia in the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries and his influence on Prague University masters see V. Herold, Pražská univerzita a Wyclif [Prague University and Wyclif], Praha, Univerzita Karlova, 1985; Šmahel, Die Prager Universität im Mittelalter , p. 467-489 (chapter on 'Wyclif's Fortune in Hussite Bohemia'); or O.

Van Dussen (eds.), Europe after Wyclif , New York, Fordham University Press, 2017, p. 89-114. According to his own testimony, Wyclif's Trialogus was copied in Oxford and brought back to Bohemia by Jerome of Prague himself. See Pavl/u00ED.a/u010D.aek, 'Wyclif 's Early Reception' , p. 94. F. Šmahel, Verzeichnis der Quellen zum Prager Universalienstreit 1348-1500 , Wrocław, Ossolineum, 1980, p. 16-17 lists five copies of Wyclif's Trialogus of Bohemian origin; all of them are today in Vienna (MSS Vienna, ÖNB, Cod. 1387; 3930; 3932; 4505; 4516). There is also evidence - although questionable - that Trialogus was translated into Czech by John Hus himself. See F. M. Barto/u0161.a, Literární činnost M. J.

It argues for a syncretic account, and appeals to the authority of Augustine and Grosseteste.

Incidentally, the doxographical part of Hus's question was incorporated (almost word for word) into a later Prague question on the mechanism of vision (see Anonymus, Utrum visio fit intus suscipiendo et non extra mittendo , MS Prague, NK ČR, V H 13, fol. 236r).\n\n67 Iohannes Hus, Quodlibet , q. 56, p. 256.\n\n68 Ma/t\\_t.ahias de Knin, Quodlibet , MS Prague, KMK, L 45, q. 114 (116), fol. 123r.\n\n69 Alexander, Albertus, Avicenna ] coni.

Even the present sketch, however, reveals that perspectivist issues were quite popular in the quodlibets, and that in their preparations the quodlibetarii utilized not only almost all the important perspectivist texts (Simon  of  Tišnov),  but  also  unexpected  theological  and  philosophical  sources popular among Bohemian masters (Wyclif used by Hus). Finally, the quodlibetarii also apparently exploited quodlibetal preparations by their former colleagues (as Hus's use of Knín suggests).\n\n## 3. John of Borotín's Quaestio on the Mechanism of Vision\n\nAs already noted, the main problem one must face investigating the presence of optical issues in the Prague quodlibets is the specific nature of the extant written sources - almost all the optical questions are preserved only in the form of preparations gathered in the handbooks by quodlibetarii before the disputations themselves.  This  kind  of  source  cannot  reveal  what  the  discussion  was  like,  or  which position the responding master held. There is however one exception - a positio (elaborated response to the question in written form) by the Czech master John of Borotín, who disputed a question on the mechanism of vision in the quodlibet by John Hus in 1411. The rest of this paper is devoted to Borotín, and to analysis of his question, which is also edited below (see Appendix II).\n\n## 3.1 Borotín's Life and Works\n\nJohn of Borotín was born in 1378, studied the arts at Prague University, and earned his bachelor's degree there in 1400 and master's in 1410. He then lectured and held several positions at the university for almost half of a century until his death (after 1458) 74 . As a fresh master of arts, he had still been attending university lectures in\n\n73 qualitas ] coni. quans cod.\n\n74 Borotín was dispensator (1414 and 1416), dean of the Faculty of Arts (1415 and again 1432), examiner of bachelors (1417 and again 1450) and rector of the whole university (1425-1426). Initially, he was also rector of  a  minor school in Zderaz (in 1412). On his life and service to the university see J. T/u0159.a/u00ED.a/u0161.aka, Literární činnost předhusitské university [Literary Work of the Pre-Hussite University], Praha, Universita Karlova, 1967, p. 166, 173; K. Ber/u00E1.anek, 'O počátcích pražské lékařské fakulty 1348-1622 [On the\n\nthe 1410s. This part of his career is well documented because he wrote down a series of lectures that he attended in his personal codex (today MS Prague, KMK, O 1), which is also useful for identifying Borotín's hand 75 . Evidently, he had a special interest in the astronomical disciplines. From the lecture reports and several dated first-person glosses it can be surmised that he attended a number of introductory lectures on astronomy in 1411: MS Prague, KMK, O 1 preserves an introductory text on De utilitatibus astrolabii by Christian of Prachatice (Křišťan z Prachatic in Czech, fols 37r-37v), an introduction to astronomy with a division of astronomical and astrological disciplines (38r-39r) and commentaries on Sphaera materialis (39v-45v) and Theorica planetarum (46r-47v, 49r-65r) 76 . Borotín then attended lectures on Thabit ibn Qurra's introduction to Ptolemy's Almagest (in 1412, fols 126r-129r) given by John Šindel (Iohannes Andreae Schindel), and Šindel's lectures on the Almagest itself  (in  1413,  fols  138r-161v) 77 ,  as  well  as  lectures on Alcabitius (in 1413, fols 72r-89v) and Alfraganus's De differentiis (in 1414, fols 181v-222r). Marginal glosses and introductory notes written in Borotín's hand indicate that he used these reportationes and excerpts several decades later when he was lecturing these texts 78 .\n\nBeginnings of the Prague Faculty of Medicine]', in Acta Universitatis Carolinae - Historia Universitatis Carolinae Pragensis , 9-2 (1968), p. 79; Šmahel, Die Prager Universität im Mittelalter , p. 146, 303-306; and esp.

The following passage includes several precisions and additions to Borotín's bibliography.\n\n75 On  the  contents  of  the  codex,  see  Patera,  Podlaha, Soupis  rukopisů , vol. II, p. 452-453; A.

David Juste is preparing a new description of the codex. The codex is in large part Borotín's autograph, as recently argued by Burne/t\\_t.a, 'Teaching', esp. p. 11-13 (the main arguments are the notes in the first person, some of them including Borotín's name). Borotín's hand is idiosyncratic - wide, very cursive and not easy to read.\n\n- 76 Traditionally, it was surmised that the text on fols 37r-65r is a copy of a text on the astrolabe (perhaps by Christian), because of a gloss on fol. 37r ('Principium in tractatum C[ristiani] De utilitatibus astrolabii 1411 […].') and a gloss on fol. 66r following this part of the codex ('1452 incepi legere Alkabicium fer&lt;ia&gt; tertia ante Ascensionem Domini ego M. Io&lt;hannes de&gt; Bo&lt;rotin&gt;'), where 'Alkabicium' was read as 'Astrolabium' . See Patera, Podlaha, Soupis rukopisů ,  vol.  II,  p.  452;  Burne/t\\_t.a, 'T eaching' , p. 13-14 also seems to incline to it. This surmise was refuted by Hadravov/u00E1.a, Hadrava, Křišťan z Prachatic , p. 77-78; who prepared editions of both Compositio astrolabii and Usus astrolabii by Christian (see Hadravov/u00E1.a, Hadrava, Křišťan z Prachatic , p. 133-171, 201-281). A closer look at these passages reveals that the text is actually a series of different commentaries, as stated above.\n\n77 On these texts, see D. Juste, 'Johannes Andree Schindel, Lectures on Thebit Bencora's De hiis que indigent expositione antequam legatur Almagesti ' (update: 30.03.2017), Ptolemaeus Arabus et Latinus. Works , accessible from: https://ptolemaeus.badw.de/work/120, and D. Juste, 'Johannes Andree Schindel, Lectures on the Almagest ' (update: 21.03.2017), Ptolemaeus Arabus et Latinus. Work s, accessible from: https://ptolemaeus.badw.de/work/77. On Schindel (1370s - between 1455 and 1458), the famous Bohemian astronomer and probable designer of the Prague astronomical clock, see, e.g., Spunar, Repertorium , vol. I, p. 133-140 and the study by Alena Hadravová and Petr Hadrava in this volume.\n\n78 This was pointed out by Burne/t\\_t.a, 'Teaching', for Borotín's lectures on Alcabitius.\n\nIn the 1410s, Borotín also participated as one of the responding masters in three quodlibetal  disputations.  He  responded  to  a  question  on  extramission  and  the mechanism of vision in John Hus's quodlibet in  1411 79 ,  a  question on mathematical disciplines and their principles in a quodlibet organized by Michael of Malenice called Čížek in 1412 80 ,  and  a  question on the generation of stones and metals in Prokop of Kladruby's quodlibet in 1417 81 .\n\nLater, during his long career as a teacher, Borotín lectured on several books of natural philosophy, astronomy and medicine. Some of his commentaries are preserved - either as his own preparations for lectures or as marginal glosses in copies of the texts he lectured on, written down as reportationes by his students. In the 1420s he lectured on medical texts - on Hippocrates's Aphorisms (1424, Borotín's brief introduction is preserved in MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 23, fol. 49r) and Isagoge Iohanitii (1430, glosses in MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 16, fols 15r-20r) and later, on Aristotle's Meteorology (1433, glosses in MS Prague, NK ČR, VII E 9, fols 107r-174v) 82 . In the final part of his life, he focused mainly on astronomy and astrology, giving lectures on Ptolemy's Quadripartitum (1444, glosses in MS Cracow, BJ, 593) 83 , Campanus of Novara's Theorica planetarum (1449, introductory notes in MS Prague, KMK, O 1, fols 129v-130r), Alfraganus's De differentiis (1450) 84 and on Alcabitius's Introduction to Astrology (in 1452 and 1454) 85 . Besides that, there are two undated commentaries written in Borotín's hand - a continuation of an exposition on the Alfonsine tables (MS Prague, KMK, O 1, fols 114r-115v) and a commentary on Euclid's Elements (MS\n\n79 Utrum sensationes fiunt per extramissiones virtutum ab organis sensitivis , preserved in MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 18, fols 58r-61r and analyzed and edited below.\n\n80 Utrum omne principium mathematicae, cuius obiectum primarium est quantitas, sit necessarium , preserved also in MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 18, fols 94v-101v.\n\n81 Utrum lapides et metalla generari in nubibus sit possibile quemadmodum in visceribus terre -  Borotín's position is not extant, there is only the quodlibetarius Prokop's preparation in MS Prague, KMK, L 27, fols 40v-41r (on which see also Koc/u00E1.anov/u00E1.a, 'The Sublunary Phaenomena', p. 94-95).\n\n82 There is also a note in MS Prague, KMK, O 1, fol. 222v (basically several paragraphs on the issue of why some regions are uninhabitable), the title of which suggests Borotín lectured on Meteorology as early as 1420: '1420 circa leccionem Metheororum M&lt;agistri&gt; J&lt;ohannis de&gt; B&lt;orotin&gt;.'\n\n83 The codex is described by M. Kowalczyk et al., Catalogus ,  vol.  IV ,  p.  144-148  and  D.  Juste, 'MS Cracow, Biblioteka Jagiellońska, 593' (update: 25.02.2017), Ptolemaeus Arabus et Latinus. Manuscripts , accessible from: https://ptolemaeus.badw.de/ms/182.\n\n84 There is testimony that Borotín lectured on Alfraganus in a list of university lectures preserved in the rear endpaper in MS Prague, KMK, L 43 (and transcribed in Tříška, Literární činnost ,  p.  173): 'Item Iohannes Borotin eodem anno [=1450] legit Alfraganum De differentiis; incepit f. III  ante Zophie.' No a commentary is extant; however, Borotín might have based his teaching on the lectures he attended in 1414 and wrote down in MS Prague, KMK, O 1.\n\n85 Borotín started to lecture on Alcabitius in 1452 (see MS Prague, KMK, O 1, fol. 66r) but apparently changed his mind - see MS Prague, KMK, O 1, fol. 66r: 'Et dicenda minori&lt;bu&gt;s sunt minora verba divi - dicamus igitur aliquid minori pro intelligendo isto libro […]. Et quia iste liber subservit astronomie, cum sit introductorius in iudicia astrorum, aliquid igitur pro noticia astronomie hic dicemus ante omnia et post hoc incipiemus istum librum dei auxilio.' He then lectured on Alcabitius again in 1454. See his preamble in O.1, fols 130r-v (edited by Burne/t\\_t.a, 'Teaching', p. 26-27), where he mentions that he had lectured on the book before but stopped (Burne/t\\_t.a, 'Teaching', p. 26, §3). The preamble ends with a cross-reference to fol. 72r, where the commentary written in 1413 starts, indicating that Borotín lectured on Alcabitius in 1454 according to his student notes from 1413.\n\nPrague, KMK, O 1, fols 165r-178r; with a long borrowing from Alan of Lille's Anticlaudianus III on geometry in the introduction). There are also mentions of Borotín's lectures on plague ( de pestilentia ) and of him as an expert on computus 86 .\n\nBorotín was evidently engaged in the quadrivium or mathematical disciplines in the broad sense, mainly in astronomy. However, does perspectiva have a special place in his thinking? It does not seem so. E.g. in the commentary glosses to Meteorology ascribed to him, the glosses to book III (a traditional place for investigating optical phenomena, such as the rainbow) are rare and short, and serve merely as explanations of difficult expressions 87 . Although he presented several methodological remarks about perspectiva in the question on mathematical principles disputed in Čížek's quodlibet 88 , the most evident influence of the optical tradition is to be found in his earliest text, the question on the mechanism of vision disputed in Hus's quodlibet .\n\n## 3.2 Utrum sensationes : Two Versions of the Text\n\nThe final redaction of Borotín's question Utrum sensationes (preserved in Prague, NK ČR, X H 18 and edited below in Appendix II) 89 consists of a brief propositio (§1-3) with basic arguments pro and contra and problema , a section including notabilia where Borotín investigates all the terms included in the title of the question (§5-28), and finally a section with conclusions and corollaries where Borotín's stance  is  presented  (§29-39).  The  text  itself  does  not  contain  any  information concerning its authorship. Nevertheless, the title of the question matches the one included in John Hus's handbook, and the propositio section is copied from Hus's preparation verbatim . Moreover, since Hus ascribes the question to John of Borotín and calls him 'a new Avicenna,' referring to Borotín's skills in medicine and optics 90 , there is no doubt that the author of the position in MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 18 is John of Borotín.\n\nThe text as preserved in MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 18 has a slightly more complicated structure. In the first place, the part of the codex under discussion includes two versions of Borotín's question. The first redaction is shorter and sketchier, con-\n\n86 See Spunar, Repertorium , vol. I, p. 42.\n\n87 See  Iohannes  de  Borot/u00ED.an, Epitome  Meteorologicorum  Aristotelis ,  MS  Prague,  NK  ČR,  VII  E  9, fols 152v-161r (book III) and especially tractatus 2 on fols 154r-161r which is 'de passionibus causatis ex refraccione radiorum solis aut lune' (fol. 152v, in mg.). Glosses explain terms for optical atmospheric phenomena such as the halo, parhelia etc. On fol. 157r a gloss points out that Aristotle speaks about vision as if it were by extramission ('Perloquitur de visu quod sit extramittendo.' See also note 124 below.). Several diagrams are included, e.g. the origin of the halo (155v), the colors of rainbow (158r) and its origin (159r, 159v, 160r).\n\n88 Here,  Borotín  explains  in  what  sense perspectiva is  subordinated  to  geometry.  See  Iohannes  de Borot/u00ED.an, Utrum omne principium , MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 18, fol. 97v.\n\n89 For reference, I use the paragraph numbers of the edition.\n\n90 Iohannes Hus, Quodlibet , q. 56, p. 255: 'Hanc autem difficultatem venerandus Magister noster, Magister Io&lt;hannes&gt; de B&lt;orotin&gt;, cum sit preclarus perspectivus et medicus, velud Avicenna alius, nostro auditorio declarabit.'; Iohannes Hus, Quodlibet , p. 281: 'Illic Iohannes Borotyn, ut Avicenna, sensaciones, qualiter fiunt intus suscipiendo et extramittendo, cum ceteris difficultatibus conpendiosissime declarabat.'\n\ntaining many crossed phrases, interlinear and marginal glosses, and consisting only of notabilia . It is written on a single bifolio; however, due to binding, the text is on the folios both before and after the second version (fols 57r-57v, 62r-62v) 91 .  The second version seems complete, as it includes not only notabilia but also conclusions and corollaries. There are also fewer cross-outs and glosses. After the text of the second version, there are several notes in the manuscript. As they relate to the main text (as argued below), I involve them in the edition (§40-43). The hand of the scribe is very cursive and, importantly, is the same for all the texts mentioned.\n\nThere are several indications which suggest that the exemplar of Borotín's question preserved in MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 18 is an autograph. The first (albeit not particularly persuasive) indication is that the hand of the scribe of Utrum sensationes is very similar to Borotín's handwriting preserved in MS Prague, KMK, O 1. Secondly,  another  question Utrum  omne  principium  mathematicae , disputed  by Borotín in the following year, is preserved in the same codex and shares both the idiosyncratic hand and complicated structure typical of Utrum sensationes . It also includes the beginning of the question, with propositio and first notabile (Prague, NK ČR, X H 18, fol. 94v) and then another version of the beginning with an additional division (95r). Further, there are notabilia , conclusions and corollaries (95r-99v); and the final version of the question is again followed by what can be considered preparatory notes that mirror the structure of the question itself (100r-101v). It is possible that two quires with Borotín's personal writings were bound (with many other disputed questions) into this collected volume.\n\nThe most persuasive reason for declaring Utrum sensationes an autograph, however, is a comparison of the two versions of the question. This comparison suggests that the scribe had worked extensively on the text, adding new parts and rearranging the old ones, refining the style, etc. Sometimes, too, a marginal gloss in the first version is extended and becomes a part of the main text in the second. All of this suggests that the scribe is identical to the author. The comparison reveals that the first version functions as preparatory notes for the second version, which is in turn carefully constructed as a final version of the text.\n\nSometimes Borotín changes the preparatory text because he finds a more suitable authority. For example, defining the term virtus (the soul's capacity to perform an action, e.g. a cognitive one), the preparatory version refers to Aristotle's definition of virtus as a habit that perfects and renders good both its bearer and his deeds, and identifies virtus with spiritus ,  understood physiologically with Avicenna as a 'subtle vapour' (fol. 57v). These are not, however, particularly convenient definitions when the virtus in dispute is a power of soul as Aristotle's definition relates rather to a moral or intellectual virtue, whereas Avicenna is talking about the physiological vehicle which is behind the workings of the power. Borotín was aware of this unsuitability, and in the final version, he proposes an entirely different definition which he borrowed from Bartholomaeus Anglicus: power is an essential attri-\n\n91 For a more detailed description of this part of MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 18 and more information about the gatherings see Appendix I.\n\nbute of the soul by means of which the soul performs its actions in the body (§14). Nevertheless, Borotín still found Aristotle's definition worth mentioning, and thus he put it after the final version of the question as an additional remark (§40), where he applies Aristotle's definition of virtue to the case of the soul's power, stressing that sensory power renders the workings of body perfect and good.\n\n| Preparatory notes fol. 57v                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Final version fol. 58v = §14                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Additional note fol. 61r = §40                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Dixi 3 o quod ad sensacionem re- quiritur virtus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Dixi 3 o quod ad sensacionem re- quiritur virtus que est causa effi- ciens sensacionis, ut dicit Con- stantinus in Pantegni .                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Unde virtus 92 - licet apud phi- losophos multipliciter accipitur, tamen pro presenti materia                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Unde ly 'virtus' apud philoso- phos multipliciter accipitur; in presenti tamen materia summitur virtus pro quadam po- tencia anime per quam ipsa suas operaciones exercet in corpore et describendum sic:                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| potest sic describi: 'virtus naturalis 93 est habitus 94 , que habentem se perficit et opus eius bonum reddit, 95 ' ut dicit Philosophus Ethicorum ; vel po- test dici spiritus, qui - ut dicit Avicenna I o Canonis , fen I a - est vapor subtilis ex sanguine reso- lutus ad totum corpus multipli- catus 96 . | 'Virtus est potencia anime ei essencialiter attributa ad suas peragendas in corpore acciones, nam mediante hac virtute anima corpus vivificat, cor et arterias constringit continue et dilatat, sensum et motum voluntarium omni animato corpori admini- strat, ut dicit idem Constantinus libro 13 in Pantegni 97 .

The definitions of virtutes (see below) in Borotín's preparatory notes, for example, are rather brief (fol. 57v), while the same passage in the final version is detailed and consists above all of borrowings from Bartholomaeus (see §15-21). It seems that Borotín discovered the usefulness of Bartholomaeus's encyclopedia for his purposes after he had already written the major part of his preparatory notes. Tacit borrowings from Bartholomaeus, although numerous in the final version, are completely absent from the preparatory notes. Sometimes it seems that Borotín realized he could improve his text with a quotation from Bartholomaeus while finalizing it. For ex-\n\n92 virtus ] sic describitur add. sed del.\n\n93 naturalis ] suprascr.\n\n94 habitus ] suprascr.\n\n95 Aristoteles, Ethica Nicomachea II, 5, 1106a15-24.\n\n96 Possibly Avicenna, Liber canonis , Basel, Johannes Herwagen, 1556, I. 1, 6, 4, fols 49-50.\n\n97 Bartholomaeus Anglicus, De proprietatibus rerum , vol. I: Prohemium, Libri I-IV, eds. B. Van den Abeele, H. Meyer, M. W. Twomey, B. Roling, R. J. Long, Turhnout, Brepols, 2007 [hereafter abbreviated as DPR I-IV], III. 14, p. 162.\n\nample, he excerpted a short passage on saliva and its role in the sense of taste from Bartholomaeus and placed it after the whole text of the preparatory notes (fol. 62v). Then, writing the final version and discussing the object of taste, he notes that what is perceptible to the sense of taste must be humid and adds a quotation from Aristotle's De anima . He might, however, have recollected the excerpt on saliva, crossed out Aristotle's saying, added these several lines on saliva from Bartholomaeus and, finally, added Aristotle's dictum again after that (see §25).\n\nThe claim that the scribe of the text may be the author himself is further confirmed by notes appended to the final version of the text (§40-43). At least some of these seem to be an outcome of a rereading and rethinking of the final version carried out by the author himself. The corollary to the first conclusion (§30), for example, states that the sensible per se does not bring about the sensation. To give precision to this statement, he later adds what 'per se' means here: he superscribed 'secundum esse reale', making clear that the statement pertains only to the sensible in its real being. Nevertheless, the distinction between the real and intentional being of the sensible, no matter how common in the medieval philosophical literature, had not previously been introduced in the text. He therefore adds a marginal gloss 'hic nota' to this place, which is most likely a cross-reference to one of the notes after the text (see §43). Here, on fol. 61v, the marginal 'hic' appears again next to the text that begins 'nota […]', and explains the distinction between esse reale and esse intentionale .\n\nIn the corollary to the fourth conclusion (§37), Borotín introduces the notion of the visual cone. He says that there is both a cone constituted by species multiplied from the sensible object and a cone constituted by species of the eye emitted from the eye (on the doctrine, see below). At the end of the corollary, however, Borotín speaks about three cones. This seeming mistake can be explained if one has Bartholomaeus's text in mind. In his discussion of vision, Bartholomaeus introduced the third cone. Besides the two cones from the object and the eye, there is a further cone of light. Borotín also had this passage on the necessity of light for vision in mind, which is proven by the fact that he includes it among the notes after the question (see §42).\n\nThese examples reveal that the question Utrum sensationes , as preserved in MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 18, is a genuine work-in-progress, its two versions representing two stages of the text formation, as the former includes many notes which in the latter were carefully elaborated, edited and refined by a scribe who, in all probability, is to be identified with the author himself.\n\n## 3.3 Utrum sensationes : Borotín's Sources\n\nAt first sight, Borotín's question appears to be quite revealing regarding its sources. There are numerous explicit references, mainly to Aristotle (10×), Constantine the African and his Pantegni (8×), and Peckham (or 'auctor Perspective communis '  -6×). It is however unclear to what extent, or even whether, Borotín worked with the actual texts of these authors (at least in the case of Aristotle and Constantine). Tracing Borotín's references reveals a considerable discrepancy between who is explicitly referred to, and from whom the passage is borrowed (see the table below). When the actual borrowings are considered, Borotín's most prominent source is -\n\nperhaps surprisingly - Bartholomaeus Anglicus and his encyclopedia De proprietatibus rerum (especially book III on human psychology) 98 .  Although almost never indicated,  there  are  no  less  than  twenty-three  borrowings  from  Bartholomaeus, some of them quite extensive 99 .\n\nSometimes Borotín uses Bartholomaues as a source for other authors' positions. It is highly probable that Borotín did not work with Constantine's Pantegni , Calcidius's commentary to Plato's Timaeus , or Aristotle's De animalibus . Although he names these works several times, in all cases either the reference to them is a part of a literal borrowing from Bartholomaeus (hence, it seems as if he quoted from these authors themselves - see, e.g., §14, 15, 20, 38) 100 ,  or Borotín deliberately ascribes quotations from Bartholomaeus to another, perhaps more eminent authority (especially to Constantine, as in §19, 25, or 27) 101 .\n\nNevertheless, it is very likely that Borotín had copies of two other sources before his eyes - Peckham's optical textbook Perspectiva communis and Galen's compendium De locis affectis (referred to by him as De interioribus ). In the case of Peckham, Borotín refers to specific propositions using correct numbering, and often quotes them literally (see §8, 10, 36, 41); sometimes he also accepts and rephrases Peckham's doctrine (see §32). The three quotations of Galen's De interioribus are less accurate, but at least one of them is still traceable (see §18) 102 .\n\n98  Bartholomaeus's encyclopedia (finished about 1240 in Saxony) was apparently popular in the Bohemian Lands. H. Meyer, Die  Enzyklopädie  des  Bartholomäus  Anglicus:  Untersuchungen  zur  Überlieferungs-  und  Rezeptionsgeschichte  von  'De  Proprietatibus  Rerum' , München, Wilhelm Fink Verlag, 2000, lists six codices which preserve an original Latin version (p. 99-101) and two other redactions or compilations (p. 171, 177) now kept in Prague libraries, all from the fourteenth or fifteenth century and most of them of Czech origin. Two copies of Bartholomaeus are also mentioned in late medieval catalogs of Prague University libraries. See Catalogi librorum vetustissimi Universitatis Pragensis , p. 127 (N I: Q48, Q49). Later in the fifteenth century, Paul Žídek used Bartholomaeus for his own encyclopedia. See A. Hadravov/u00E1.a, Kniha dvacatera umění mistra Pavla Žídka: část přírodovědná [Master Paul Žídek's Book of Twenty Arts. The Natural Sciences Part], Praha, Academia, 2008, p. 47-48.\n\n99 There is one unwitting reference to Bartholomaeus's text in §21 of Borotín's quaestio .  Borotín,  introducing three kinds of bodily spirit, compiles this paragraph out of excerpts from chapter III, 22 of Bartholomaeus's encyclopedia. Having tacitly borrowed Bartholomaeus's claim that the spirit is generated in the liver,  Borotín  avoids  summarizing  Bartholomaeus's  scrupulous  exposition  of  the propagation of spiritus through other organs by reference (where 'post presentem' means 'after the just quoted passage from Bartholomaeus') to his source: 'Quaere post presentem de generacione huius spiritus.'\n\n100\n\nHence, Borotín's reference to Calcidius in §20 cannot unfortunately be used as further evidence for the dissemination and popularity of his commentary to Plato's Timaeus among Bohemian masters around 1400. On Platonist influences on Prague University masters see, e.g., E. Jeauneau, 'Plato apud Bohemos', in Mediaeval Studies , 41 (1979), p. 161-214, esp. p. 162-168; Herold, Pražská univerzita a Wyclif , p. 230-231; or Pavl/u00ED.a/u010D.aek, 'Wyclif 's Early Reception' , who listed numerous borrowings in the works by Borotín's contemporary Jerome of Prague (p. 100, 113).\n\n101 Such a practice might have been common among Bohemian scholars. Use of Bartholomaeus's encyclopedia is proven in the Czech lexicographer Claret (Bartholomaeus de Solencia in Latin, Bartoloměj z Chlumce in Czech) a half-century before Borotín. See, e.g., A. Vidmanov/u00E1.a, 'Mistr Klaret a jeho spisy [Master Claret and His Writings]', in Listy filologické , 103-4 (1980), p. 221.\n\n102 Borotín probably used a copy of Galen when working on his preparatory notes, whereas he prepared the final version without further reference to it. When discussing the faculty of movement ( virtus\n\n| Source                                                 | Explicit references   | Actual borrowings (as identified in the edition below)   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Bartholomaeus Anglicus, De proprietatibus rerum        | -                     | 23                                                       |\n| Aristotle (various works)                              | 10                    | 8                                                        |\n| Peckham, Perspectiva communis                          | 6                     | 6                                                        |\n| Averroes (various works)                               | 2                     | 3                                                        |\n| Galenus, De interioribus                               | 3                     | 3 (?)                                                    |\n| Constantinus Africanus ( Pantegni or unspecified work) | 8                     | 1 (?)                                                    |\n| Calcidius, Super Timaeum                               | 1                     | -                                                        |\n\nSometimes Borotín uses  terminology  or  phrases  from  Buridanian De  anima commentaries; this terminology, however, was so common that it is impossible to trace his exact sources (see, e.g., §27, 35). Further, he introduces an argument very similar to one proposed by John of Jandun in his De sensu commentary (see §35 and the respective note). Borotín might have had access to Jandun's works 103 , although Jandun's argument might also have become a part of later tradition and Borotín could have encounter it in another work. Also, the definition of sensation that Borotín incidentally added in the margin at the beginning of the notabilia section may be borrowed from 10 th -century Jewish philosopher Isaac Israeli (see §7).\n\nFinally,  there  is  no  link  between  the  quodlibetal  preparation  by  Hus  and Borotín's positio except the fact that the propositio of Hus's preparation and Borotín's question (in both preliminary and final versions) are identical 104 . Borotín, however, neither addresses any of Hus's arguments nor makes any indication that he was acquainted with Hus's preparation for disputation. The explanation suggesting itself is that Borotín received the propositio before the quodlibetal disputation, prepared a written determination of the question which he then presented during the ses-\n\n103\n\nmotiva ), Borotín mentions Galen's example of a patient hit in his spine, whose three fingers lost the capability to move while they remained able to feel (see §18). Nevertheless, Galen described precisely the opposite case: the patient lost the sense in his fingers, but could move them (Galenus, 'De interioribus', in Quarta impressio ornatissima continens omnes Galeni libros , ed. Rusticus Placentinus, Pavia, De Burgofranco, 1515, I. 6, vol. II, fol. 27rb: '[…] dixit sensum digitorum a triginta diebus esse ablatum, motus vero digitorum permansit […].'). Interestingly, Borotín rephrased Galen correctly in the preparatory notes (see fol. 62r: '[…] narrat Galenus I o De interioribus de quodam homine, qui amiserat sensum in tribus digitis, motum tamen non amisit.') but adjusted this example in the final version. Borotín's acquaintance with the so-called 'new Galen' may be considered a further proof of his connection to the Faculty of Medicine, which is sometimes suggested but founded only on indirect evidence. See Ber/u00E1.anek, 'O počátcích', p. 79; Šmahel, Die Prager Universität im Mittelalter , p. 146. The  notes  on De  anima written  in  Borotín's  hand  preceding  the quaestio encompass  a  variant  of andun's theory of two substantial forms of the human being, namely, cogitative and intellective soul. J Compare MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 18, fol. 56v with Iohannes de Ianduno, Super libros Aristotelis de Anima subtilissimae quaestiones ,  Venice, Hieronymus Scotus, 1552, fol. 71ra. On Borotín's notes on the human intellect, see Appendix I. Jandun's commentary on De anima is also mentioned in the catalogs of Prague University libraries; see Catalogi librorum vetustissimi Universitatis Pragensis , p. 40 (shelfmark R II: G27), p. 139 (shelfmark N II: D18).\n\n104 Compare §1-3 in the edition (and the beginning of Borotín's preparatory notes in MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 18, fol. 57r) with Hus's preparation in Hus, Quodlibet , q. 56, p. 255.\n\nsion. His question as preserved in MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 18 originated before the session itself, as it does not seem to reflect either Hus's preparation or the discussion that probably followed Borotín's performance 105 .  Further, it is also uncertain whether Borotín read his positio in its entirety during the session, as it is quite long (and a little tedious in its notabilia section) and 54 masters were responding to a question in Hus's quodlibet that lasted only a couple of days 106 .  Hus noted at the end of his handbook that Borotín responded very concisely ( conpendiosissime ) 107 .\n\nNevertheless, another interpretation is possible. Borotín might have presented his preliminary version of the text, which includes merely the notabilia ;  in  other words, he might just have explained the meanings of all the words employed in the title of the question. Only after the discussion with Hus, might he have prepared the final version of the question intended for distribution, where he takes the syncretic position connecting intromissionist and extramissionist accounts of perception, paying homage not only to Peckham but also to Wyclif, the source of Hus's preparation. The issue of the exact shape of the Prague quodlibetal disputations remains undecided 108 .\n\n## 3.4 Borotín's Position in the Dispute over the Mechanism of Vision\n\nOnce textual issues and Borotín's sources have been investigated, the doctrinal aspects of the question can be scrutinized. The question asks 'whether sensations occur by the [sensory] powers being emitted out of the sensitive organs' ( Utrum sensationes fiunt per extramissiones virtutum ab organis sensitivis ) and is thus devoted to the issue of what the mechanism of vision is. This issue arose even in Ancient philosophy and science, and was still popular in the Latin Middle Ages. As pre-modern optics concerned not only the physics of light but also the physiology and psychology of seeing, it became one of the crucial questions investigated in optical science. The history of pre-modern optics is often narrated as a clash between two competing answers to this issue, i.e. intromission and extramission. Some authors (such as Democritus or Aristotle) proposed an intromissionist explanation of the visual mechanism as they claimed that we see by receiving an entity in our sight. For Aristotle, for example, such an entity is a causal effect of the quality (color) of the external object ( eidos or species ) that first actualizes the medium between the object and the observer, and then the observer's power of sight. Other authors (such as Plato, Euclid or Galen) favoured the extramissionist explanation of vision: our sight must issue forth or emit an entity in order to see. Such an entity is a visual\n\n105 In his pivotal book on Prague quodlibets, Jiří Kejř argues that such was a common practice. According to Liber decanorum ,  the quodlibetarius had to deliver the topic of the question to every responding master three or four days before the session (see Kej/u0159.a, Kvodlibetní disputace , p. 28); extant positiones of various masters reflect neither the actual discussion (Kej/u0159.a, Kvodlibetní disputace , p. 62-63) nor the quodlibetarius ' s preparation (except in just one case, see Kej/u0159.a, Kvodlibetní disputace , p. 67-68).\n\n106 Kej/u0159.a, Kvodlibetní disputace , p. 92.\n\n107 See quotation in note 90.\n\n108 I thank Ota Pavlíček, who prepares an up-to-date study on the processual aspect of Prague quodlibetal disputations, for his insights into the matter.\n\nray of fire or light nature for Platonists or Euclidians; for Galenists, it is a visual spirit or pneuma 109 .\n\nSometimes historians argue that the dispute was settled as early as in the eleventh century by the Muslim scientist Alhacen, who united all the traditions and elaborated  a  powerful  explanatory  optical  paradigm  based  on  intromission  and denying extramission 110 . Nevertheless, some Latin perspectivists of the thirteenth century (esp. Roger Bacon and John Peckham), although heavily influenced by Alhacen and proposing intromission, still made room for extramission 111 .  The question of intromission and extramission had therefore not been answered once and for all for Latin medieval scholars. It has the status of a problema (an unsettled issue where both positions are equally attractive), and was thus ideal for quodlibetal disputations - and as pointed out above, a question on extramission vs intromission was included in almost every Prague quodlibet .\n\nResponding  to  the  question  given  to  him  by  Hus,  Borotín  chooses  what  is called by his contemporary Zdeněk of Labouň the 'ancient way' ( modus antiquus ), i.e. to first define all of the terms included in the title of the question (rather than to divide the response into a series of articles, which is the modus modernus ) 112 . In terms of word count, this notabilia section is the longest as it occupies c. 58/u0025.o of the text (whereas the section with conclusions occupies only c. 26/u0025.o and the additional notes only 14/u0025.o). Further, Borotín is sometimes verbose in the notabilia . He seems to forget that the question is restricted only to the visual power and adds more information about faculty psychology in general, or organs and media of all the senses, which eventually turns the notabilia section into a general introduction to the theory of the sensitive soul and its operations.\n\nIn the notabilia section, there is a palpable tension between Aristotelian influence and the more Platonizing tendencies delivered by Bartholomaeus Anglicus (whose encyclopedia predates the broad dissemination of Aristotle's psychology after c. 1240s and hence still bears the seal of the twelfth-century Platonic- and Galenic-oriented philosophy) 113 .  Sometimes, Borotín tries to assume a compromise position; sometimes he sides with Bartholomew. For example, Borotín follows Aristotle's lead when he defines what sensory perception ( sensatio ) amounts to be. The sensation is a kind of apprehension realized when a species (i.e. a similitude) of the object is impressed on a sense (§5). The species is a sensible accidental form of the object (e.g. color); however, it is abstracted from the material realization that it has when inhering in the object. In this frame, Borotín also introduces the famous Aristotelian analogy with wax and\n\n109 For the dispute among Ancient thinkers, see Lindberg, Theories of Vision , p. 1-17 and Smith, From Sight to Light , p. 23-75.\n\n110 E.g. Lindberg, Theories of Vision , p. 58-86, esp. 85-86.\n\n111 See Lindberg, Theories of Vision , p. 107-121 or Smith, From Sight to Light , p. 256-273.\n\n112 Zdenko de Labun, Questio astronomicalis ,  §3, p. 135 : '[…] respondeatur secundum modum antiquum, videlicet simpliciter declarando ea, que ponuntur in titulo questionis, sine hoc, quod questio ipsa in multos articulos distingwatur, qui est modus modernus.'\n\n113 R. J. Long, the editor of book III of DPR , stresses the influence of the pseudo-Augustinian work De spiritu et anima and also medical tradition, esp. Constantine the African. See Bartholomaeus, DPR , p. 139-142.\n\nseal (§7). He does not, though, seem to agree with more Aristotelian-minded thinkers in reducing the sensation to a passive reception of species (although he mentions this Aristotelian position in §7). Influenced by Bartholomew, he acknowledges the more Platonic view that the efficient cause of the sensory act is the sensory soul (or its power) itself (§12, 14) 114 . An apparent conflict between these two views is resolved by distinguishing between (principal) efficient causality and an instrumental one. The sensation is apprehension effectuated by both the species (as the instrumental cause) and the sensory power (as the efficient cause) (§5).\n\nAnother example is the issue of the nature of eye, concerning which there was a debate between Aristotelians and Platonists. On the one hand, Aristotelians proposing intromission stressed the ability of the eye-jelly to receive impressions, inferred that it must be easily malleable and concluded that eyes are of a watery nature 115 . On the other hand, Platonists surmised that eyes are of an igneous nature and that their inner light or spirit may emit forth. A fiery nature is also ascribed to the eyes by Bartholomaeus Anglicus 116 . Borotín admits that - insofar as its ability to receive impressions is considered - the eye may be called watery, but its proper nature is different. Borotín wants to assign one element to each of the senses - and as the organ of hearing is airy, that of taste is watery, that of smell is fiery, and that of touch is dominated by the element earth (§9), the element which remains for vision is the aether 117 . Borotín's statement is not to be pushed too far (and read as an ascription of a special celestial nature to the eyes); he simply wants to emphasize that the eyes have a sort of natural light which participates somehow (see below) in the visual process. He supports this claim by reference to Peckham's Perspectiva communis (§8) 118 . Later in the additional notes (§41), Borotín repeats that eyes are of an aetherous nature and compares them to celestial bodies. Just as some stars are warmer and have stronger rays while others have only diminished light, so various animals have visual powers of different strengths. Borotín concludes that some animals have eyes with more natural light than humans, and are able to emit stronger visual rays, which is supported by popular extramissionist anecdotes (also mentioned by Peckham) - cats or wolves allegedly see in darkness, and the lynx is even able to see through walls 119 .\n\n114 See esp. Bartholomaeus, DPR III, 17, p. 167 (for vision); 18, p. 172 (hearing); 19, p. 174 (smell); 20, p. 176 (taste); 21, p. 178 (touch). The ascription of a causal role to the soul's power is typical of  the  Platonic  and  Galenic  tradition.  See,  e.g.,  William  of  Conches, Glosae  super  Platonem , ed. E. A. Jeauneau, Turnhout, Brepols, 2006, II, 148, p. 267 or Constantinus Africanus, 'Pantegni', in Ysaac, Omnia opera , 2 vols, Lyon, 1515, vol. II, fols 1ra-144ra, here Theorica IV. 10, fol. 17ra.\n\n115 See Aristoteles, De sensu 2 where he criticizes his predecessors and states his position.\n\n116 Bartholomaeus, DPR III, 17, p. 167: 'Sensus igitur visus, cum sit igneus, est simplicissimus […].'\n\n117 Such a matching of elements and sensory organs has a long tradition in pre-modern philosophy. See, e.g.,  Augustinus, De Genesi ad litteram libri duodecim ,  ed.  J.  Zycha,  Prag  /  Wien  /  Leipzig, F. Tempsky, 1894, III. 4, p. 66-67 who, however, assigns a fiery nature to sight. Aether was regarded as a special fifth element of a very subtle, fiery and crystalline nature, located above normal air and a constituent of celestial spheres.\n\n118 Peckham, Perspectiva communis I, 46 (49), p. 128-130. However, Peckham does not explicitly assign an aetherous nature to the eyes; he seems to accept the Aristotelian position about their watery nature. Cf. Peckham, Perspectiva communis I, 31 (34), p. 112.\n\n119 Cf. Peckham, Perspectiva communis I, 46 (49), p. 128-130; 51 (54), p. 132.\n\nAnother example from the notabilia section of Borotín siding with medical authors rather than Aristotelians is his classification of the soul's powers ( virtutes ). While the fundamental division for Aristotelians is into vegetative, sensory and rational faculties, Borotín introduces a Galenic division which can be found in Constantinus, and which he borrows from Bartholomaeus Anglicus. There are three basic  powers  (§14-20):  (1)  natural  power  ( virtus  naturalis ),  responsible  for  the vegetative functions of the body; (2) vital power ( virtus vitalis ) which brings life to  the  individual body; and animal power ( virtus  animalis ),  responsible for cognitive functions and locomotion. All of these powers are embodied. Natural power originates from the liver, vital power has its seat in the heart and is diffused by the arteries throughout the body, and animal power is seated in the brain. Borotín also borrows the medical notion of spiritus (§21) which is a subtle matter diffused through the body which, in Platonic thinking, plays the role of mediator between the immaterial soul and material body. There are three kinds of spiritus corresponding to the three powers (natural, vital and animal).\n\nIn a brief but important remark closing his exposition of powers and spiritus (§21), Borotín qualifies the meaning of the term 'extramission' included in the title of the question. In his view, what is emitted is not a body of a luminous or fiery nature (e.g. a ray of inner light, as Platonists would maintain), but precisely these powers, namely, the sensitive  ones.  As  will  become  obvious  in  the  conclusions, such  a  qualification  enables  Borotín  to  hold  a  compromise  position  between intromission and extramission.\n\nThe influences of the three sources quoted most frequently by Borotín - Bartholomew's encyclopedia, Aristotle, and Peckham's Perspectiva communis - are not present equally in all the sections. As pointed out, Bartholomew's domain is the notabilia section, whereas Aristotle's and Peckham's influences are more evident in the section with conclusions. Responding to the central issue of the text - whether vision is  by  extramission  -  Borotín  continues to balance between opposing authorities.\n\nInitially, he proposes a version of an Aristotelian intromissionist account of vision. He begins with an evident intuition that every sensation is in its proper sensory organ (conclusion 1, §29) and not outside of it, as the extramissionists seem to imply. This intuition is corroborated not only by Aristotle's authority in De sensu but also by reasoning: if the efficient cause of the sensory act is the sensory power - and Borotín (under Bartholomew's influence) agrees with this - then since the power is in the organ, its effect is in the same place.\n\nHowever, the sensible object itself is  not present and efficacious in the sensory organ as seeing a green color, the eye does not actually become green. Borotín states this in the corollary (§30), and solves the problem by the Aristotelian distinction between the real and intentional being of the sensible (he adds the proper expression of the distinction as an additional note after the text, as pointed out above - see §43). Every sensible object can thus replicate (or, in perspectivist terminology, 'multiply') its causal effects through the medium. These effects are the so-called species , i.e. similitudes having mere intentional being (concl. 2, §31).\n\nThe question remains as to how the presence of the seen object in the eyes (its repraesentatio ) is provided. Does it occur by extramission of the powers towards\n\nthe objects or by receiving their species in the senses? Borotín uses this dilemma to argue against extramission in a way influenced by Peckham 120 . If extramission were the case, then the power would not only issue from the eye, reach the object and stop there. As the sensation occurs in the organs, the power would have to return to the eye and 'announce' the object to it. Such a conception is however absurd. Emitted powers would have to be animated, even rational and capable of voluntary movements, as they would go forth and return. Therefore, intromission appears to be a better option. Sensation occurs by species of the objects, multiplied through the medium and impressed in the eyes, which in turn cause the acts of sensation (concl. 3, §34). Additionally, every power whose operation is immanent (i.e. which produces nothing besides itself) is actualized only if it receives something from outside. The extramissionist explanation of vision would lead to a counter-intuitive conception of vision: the visual power would always be actualized (and never in potentiality), and its operation would not be immanent (§35). Intromission is thus a more plausible way to explain the mechanism of vision.\n\nBorotín's response could end right after conclusion 3. In that case, his position would amount to an Aristotelian intromissionist account of vision. However, he adds another conclusion which - perhaps surprisingly - rehabilitates extramission. Such a move would be unexpected, if it were not anticipated by the perspectivists of the thirteenth century, namely by John Peckham who is Borotín's direct source here. Extramission is introduced not as a single explanation of vision but in a way trying to make it compatible with intromission. In other words, Borotín (like Peckham) does not want to assert that extramission is the primary mechanism of vision, although it is somehow involved in a process which is generally intromissionist.\n\nBorotín implies two reasons why extramission may be appealing. Firstly, there is an ontological gap between crude material objects and the visual power which is,  after  all,  a  part  of  the  sensory  soul  and  thus  subtler  (albeit  not  as  completely immaterial as intellect). The species of the material object must therefore be refined and rendered proportionate to the visual power in order to be able to act upon it. This demand is met precisely by extramission - the power is emitted from the eyes (in the form of a cone) and makes the species proportionate to itself. The species are 'moderated' ( contemperantur ) and made suitable to enter the eye. If they were not moderated, sight would gradually be disintegrated by them (concl. 4, §36) 121 .\n\nSecondly, sometimes extramission of the 'natural light' of the eyes can substitute for external light when it is lacking. As commonly accepted, vision requires ordinary light - the color of objects cannot multiply their species without  being mingled with the light 122 . However, as some ancient anecdotes allege, some animals\n\n120 Compare §32 with Peckham, Perspectiva communis I, 45 (48), p. 128 (quoted in the edition).\n\n121 Borotín's source is Peckham, Perspectiva communis I,  46 (49), p. 128-130. Cf. also Rogerius Bacon, Perspectiva I.  7,  4,  p.  104-106  and  L.  Li/u010D.aka,  'The  Visual  Process:  Immediate  or  Successive? Approaches to the Extramission Postulate in 13th-Century Theories of Vision', in E. Baltuta (ed.), Medieval Perceptual Puzzles: Theories of Sense-Perception in the 13th and 14th Centuries , Leiden, Brill, 2020, p. 89-94.\n\n122 See, e.g., Peckham, Perspectiva communis I, 47 (50), p. 130.\n\ncan see in darkness. Borotín (again following Peckham) explains this precisely by advocating extramission: The visual powers of some animals are so strong that they can replace the outer light and give a 'power to multiply' ( virtus  multiplicativa ) even to color in darkness (§41) 123 .\n\nBorotín  therefore  combines  both  competing  positions.  The  primary  mechanism is intromission (the eyes receive species both  of  colors  and  light),  but  extramission is also involved in the process (the powers are emitted forth towards the objects in order to moderate and sometimes corroborate the species ). All three movements (the multiplication of species of colors and light, and the emission of powers) constitute three visual cones, with the apex in the eye and the base on the visible object - all occupying the same place (§37). Whereas perspectivists postulated only two cones (of species and of emitted power), Borotín adopts three cones from Bartholomaeus Anglicus.\n\nTo sum up, Borotín presents a compromise position. On the one hand, his answer to the question given to him by Hus is negative. In his view, sensations do not occur through extramission of the sensory power but rather by receiving the species of  the  object.  The  primary  mechanism  behind  vision  is  not  extramission but intromission. On the other hand, although he denies a robust conception of extramission, Borotín still argues for involving extramission (of visual power) in the visual process as important for 'refining' species coming from the outside to the eye. Is this an eclectic position, a superficial mixing of different sources without real understanding? It is worth noting that such a combination of intromission and extramission was quite common among medieval thinkers. Even Aristotle - although read as a strict intromissionist by thinkers like Albert the Great or Thomas Aquinas - was sometimes interpreted as conceding extramission 124 .  Stressing the extramissionist hints in Aristotle was common in the thirteenth century, especially among Franciscan thinkers (e.g. Bartholomaeus Anglicus, Bacon and Peckham). Not surprisingly, these authors also want to integrate extramission into their general account of perception. Thus, the compromise view presented by Borotín is derived directly from Peckham, but one may also find it in Bartholomew or Bacon 125 . The popularity of this position is also manifested by the fact that later in the fourteenth century it was held by John Wyclif who proposes it at least in his Trialogus 126 ,\n\n123 See also Peckham, Perspectiva communis I, 46 (49), p. 128-130.\n\n124 Especially some parts of his Meteorology (where he uses the notion of the visual ray to account for some meteorological phenomena), De animalibus (see §38 of Borotín's question), or De somno , where he  mentions  a  case  of  a  menstruating  woman  whose  gaze  allegedly  clouds  a  mirror  (2,  459b24460a23). The last passage (in Latin translation) is referred to in the excerpts from various texts on dreams written in Borotín's hand in his personal codex and interpreted as proposing extramission. See MS Prague, KMK, O 1, fol. 10r: '[…] facile hic videtur quod visus fiat extramittendo, ut per totum 3 m Metheororum videtur velle Aristoteles, ubi loquitur de refraccione visus.'\n\n125 Bartholomaeus Anglicus, DPR III. 17, p. 168, 169-170; Rogerius Bacon, Perspectiva I. 7, 2-4, p. 100-106.\n\n126 As mentioned in section II above, the evangelic doctor also ascribes this position to Augustine and Robert Grosseteste (Iohannes Wyclif, Trialogus II.  7,  p.  97);  see  also  Phillips,  'John  Wyclif ' , p. 258.\n\nwhich in turn inspired Hus in his preparation for discussion with Borotín. Thus, Borotín's conclusion was likely in consonance to what was regarded as the correct opinion among his peers during the quodlibetal session.\n\n## 4. Conclusions\n\nThis paper aimed to investigate the dissemination of perspectivist texts and knowledge of the discipline among Prague University masters around 1400. Despite the lack of optical manuscripts extant in Prague today, it has been documented that perspectiva was taught at the Prague Faculty of Arts at least from the 1370s and - on the examples of Jenek of Prague and Conrad of Soltau - that it was also referred to in philosophical and theological lectures. The main source for such investigation, however, is the Prague quodlibets organized from the 1390s to the 1410s. There are 13 questions explicitly dealing with optical topics included in the extant handbooks by Prague masters that organized a quodlibet . Some attest a considerable knowledge of perspectivist texts (Simon of Tišnov), while some are derived from other, more philosophical sources (namely from Wyclif, in the case of John Hus).\n\nThe only extant positio is the question on the mechanism of vision by John of Borotín. As it is a juvenile work by a fresh master of arts, expectations should not be too high. Borotín borrows extensively from De proprietatibus rerum by Bartholomaeus Anglicus in the notabilia section (on sensory powers and organs), but his position is influenced rather by John Peckham's textbook Perspectiva communis . He uses Peckham's arguments against extramission, but in the end proposes a compromise intromissionist account with some extramissionist features in a manner similar to Peckham. Nevertheless, Borotín's question is rather a cognate of Aristotelian psychological works than a full-fledged perspectivist text (e.g. Borotín includes nothing at all from geometrical optics) 127 .\n\n127 I am indebted to Ota Pavlíček and Pavel Blažek for discussions on the subject of this paper, and their valuable comments on the edition. My thanks also go to David Juste for sharing his copy of Borotín's codex with me, to Matyáš Havrda for his help in identifying the citations from Galen, and to Alena Hadravová for her hints on the dissemination of De proprietatibus rerum in Bohemia.\n\n## Appendix I Borotín's Notes in MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 18\n\nThe final redaction of Borotín's quaestio is preserved in MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 18 on fols 58r-61r among several different texts written in the same hand. All these texts constitute a part of the codex (55r-62v) which is - in terms of its handwriting - independent of adjacent parts. This part is also separated by blank folios (54 bis r - 54 ter v; 62 bis r - 62 bis v) 128 . As was argued above, this part of the codex may comprise folios Borotín himself used for recording notes, excerpts or preparing his own texts, and which were later bound together with other gatherings into one codex. A brief description of the contents of the passages written by what can be considered Borotín's hand follows:\n\n## 55r-56v: Notes on quaestiones on (human) intellect\n\nInc.: Sicud habet se sensus ad sensibilia, sic intellectus ad intelligibilia.\n\nNota: duplex est passio […]\n\nExpl.: […] ex 2  Metaphysice Buridani questione o .\n\nThis passage includes rather short quaestiones dealing with intellect. These notes or excerpts are of different lengths (some of them gather several arguments and notabilia, others a few sentences). The titles are: Utrum intellectus sit virtus passiva vel activa ; U. intellectus possibilis sit intelligibilis ; U. intellectus sit separatus ab intelligibili ; U. intellectus potest intelligere sine phantasmate ; U. calidum consumat ipsum humidum radicale (a mere title without text); U. indivisibile est intelligibile ; U. intellectus possibilis sit ens in pura potencia ; U. intellectiva anima sit forma substancialis .\n\nThe topics of all these questions belong to the tradition of commentaries on Aristotle's De anima III; the reference in the explicit indicates that they may be of a Buridanian origin. If written by Borotín himself, they may represent his reportationes of lectures on De anima or preparations for an exam.\n\nThe text seems to be written on a single independent bifolio.\n\n57r-57v: Shorter redaction of Borotín's Utrum sensationes […] - first part\n\nInc.: tur sic […]\n\nExpl.: […] et ista instrumenta iam … | in marg. inf.: motum, qui in prora, sensum.\n\nUtrum sensaciones fiunt per extramissionem virtutum ab organis sensitivis. ArguiQui ergo leditur in puppi amittit\n\n128 The composition of this part of the codex is not entirely clear at first sight, as the binding is very tight and the quires are mostly irregular. However, an inspection in situ revealed that fols 55-56 seem to represent an independent bifolio attached to a ternio (fols 57-62). All these folios are yellowed and timeworn, which contrasts with the brighter bifolio (54 ter + 62 bis) into which both the bifolio and ternio seem to be inserted. Such a quiring scheme (1+[1+1]+[3+3]+1) accords with the textual content of the gathering: while the bifolio includes Borotín's notes on De anima , the ternio preserves two versions of his quodlibetal positio .\n\nAs argued above, this part presents a preliminary, shorter but highly glossed version of Borotín's quaestio . It continues on fols 62r-62v. Note that fols 57 and 62 constitute a bifolio.\n\n## 58r-61r: Longer redaction of Borotín's Utrum sensationes […]\n\nInc.: Utrum sensaciones […].\n\nExpl.: […] questio, ut proponitur, est falsa.\n\nEdited below, see §§1-39.\n\n## 61r-v: Several notes connected to the main text of the quaestio\n\nInc.:\n\nVirtus, ut dicit Philosophus […]\n\nExpl.: […] qua sentiri debet sicuti est.\n\nEdited below, see §§40-43. Together with the preceding item, these texts are written on two bifolios (58-61).\n\n## 62r-62v: Shorter redaction of Borotín's Utrum sensationes […] - second part\n\nInc.: | … sunt sicud canalia que si obstruuntur per aliquam viscosum vel grossum humorem, cessat motus et sensus […]\n\nExpl.: Item ergo stantibus concurentibus sensu, organo eius, virtute, obiecto et medio et intencione actuali sensus super sensibile, causatur sensacio .\n\n## 62v: An excerpt on saliva from Bartholomaeus Anglicus\n\nInc.: Saliva in sapore est insipida […]\n\nExpl.: […] secundum qualitatem saporis rei gustate immutatur; hoc Constantinus .\n\nThis passage is not part of the preliminary version of the quaestio ; however, Borotín included it in the final one. See §25 in the edition.\n\n## Appendix II Critical Edition of John of Borotín's Quaestio utrum sensationes fiunt per extramissiones virtutum ab organis sensitivis\n\n## Ratio edendi\n\nThe question edited below is extant in a single manuscript (MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 18, fols 58r-61v). As argued above, the text preserved in the manuscript is written by the author himself in two versions. The aim of the present edition is more doctrinal than philological; thus, only the version the author considered final is edited here and the variants between both versions are not recorded. A full comparison of these two versions (merely indicated above) is beyond the scope of the present paper and may perhaps be the subject of future work on Borotín. Further, since the text is autograph, the additions, corrections and glosses, both marginal and interlinear (all of which are written in the same hand as the main text) are regarded as integral to the text itself and, consequently, are involved in the main edited text (the fact that they are later additions by the author is always indicated in the apparatus) 129 .\n\nI decided not to classicize the orthography, and the spelling of the manuscript is preserved even if it varies throughout the text (e.g. olofactus x ollofactus ). The only exception is a systematic distinction between the vowel letter u and the consonant v . Admittedly, this strategy of adhering to the manuscript's orthography does not free the editor from having to make a choice from time to time, especially when a medieval scribe's abbreviation enables different spellings. In such cases, I resort to the reading which is, to my best knowledge, more common in late medieval Bohemian manuscripts 130 .\n\nUpper-case letters are used in the edition to mark the beginning of a sentence, proper  names,  generic  names  used  in  reference  to  an  individual  person  ( Philosophus , Commentator ), or titles of texts. The titles are italicized. Abbreviations of the numerals are preserved (e.g. 3 o ). Roman numerals are not substituted by Arabic numerals and vice versa. The text is divided into sentences according to its meaning, the interpunction follows the logical order of the text rather than the punctuation in the manuscript, which is only occasional and often insufficient. The division into paragraphs preserves the original division in the manuscript\n\n129 I omit only the one-word glosses signaling the contents of the respective paragraph (e.g. the words vitalis and animalis on fol. 59r pointing to the parts of the text on the vital and animal power; see §16, and 17.)\n\n130 A special case is the Latin word for 'corollary' since medieval scribes used not only the correct variant corollarium , but also (and perhaps preferably) the incorrect variant correlarium . The present text includes seven instances of the abbreviation'cor m ',  which may be expanded in both ways (see §30 [twice], 31, 35 [twice], 37, and 39). However, §37 includes the derived adverb corollarie abbreviated as'cor'e ', which permits only the 'incorrect' reading e correlarie . Hence, I resort to the incorrect variant correlarium instead of the correct variant corollarium .\n\nonly partially: longer paragraphs are divided according to their sense. The paragraphs are numbered mainly to facilitate references. Quotation marks ('…') are used (i) to mark a piece of text that the author obviously intended as a quotation (usually, such a part of the text is preceded by an explicit reference to a particular author and/or his text); (ii) to indicate a tacit verbatim borrowing from another text by another author; and (iii) to mark an expression which is intended to refer to itself and not to its meaning (often preceded by ly in medieval Latin text). Square brackets ([…]) enclose words that I think should be deleted. Angle brackets ( &lt;…&gt; ) enclose words that I added, mainly headings and the numbers of the paragraphs. Editorial conjectures are indicated only in the apparatus by the abbreviation coni.\n\n## Conspectus auctoritatum\n\nAlbertus, Mineralia = Albertus Magnus, Mineralia . Opera omnia, vol.

Sicut enim cera recipit formam sigilli sine materia, sic sensus speciem sensibilis sine materia, ut vult  Philosophus 2 o De anima .  Species  autem  senciendi est similitudo materialis et propria rei, qua res materialiter cognosci habet sicuti est. Sunt autem sensus quidam interiores, quidam exteriores, sed dimissis interioribus, restringetur sermo pro exterioribus, de quibus magis videtur eodem questionis intencio.\n\n&lt;8&gt; Sunt autem sensus exteriores quinque - sensus visus, auditus, ollofactus, gustus et tactus - quibus fit sensacio, quarum eciam sunt organa quinque distincta secundum quinque corpora sensibilia principalissima mundi  corporei.  Primum  est  organum  visus  quod  est  quodammodo nature etheree ex eo quod est diafanum et lumen est sibi connatum, ut dicit auctor Perspective communis 46  proposicione primi: 'Lumen oculi a naturale radiositati sua conferre visui' . Sed quia organum visus faciliter recipit species et conservat, dicitur aquee nature.\n\n&lt;9&gt; Organum ollofactus est ignee, cum sit calidius et siccius. Auditus aeree: nam organum auditus mediante aere quodam in tortuositate auris complantato recipit species sui sensibilis et conservat. Organum gustus aquee, tactus autem terree. Omnis enim res corporea substancialis est nature alicuius illorum corporum. Similiter et organum. Dico igitur quod quilibet sensus habet suum organum, in quo suum exercet officium.\n\n&lt;10&gt; Organum visus est humor glacialis vel cristalinus, | ut dicit 36 a Communis  perspective :  'Visum  vigere  in  glaciali  humore' .

Que tunica si rumpitur, ita quod humor ille crystalinus effluit, visus corrumpitur, unde dicit Galienus I o De interioribus , quando quidam puer prefixit sibi humorem albugineum ita quod aliquot gutte eius eximit et tamen virtus visiva non fuit lesa, differens tamen est humor ille.

Organum gustus est quidam nervus a cerebro ad lingue medium ductus ad extremitates lingue ramificatus. Organum tactus est quidam nervus per totum corpus ramificatus et expansus sicud rethe. Et omnes isti nervi habent ortum de ventriculi cerebri a prora, i.e. anteriori parte cerebri.

    "system_prompt": "## GOAL\nArgument‑mine the following paper to extract its comprehensive argumentative structure.\n\n## DEFINITIONS\n1. **Argument**: A set of propositions, including some number of premises and a conclusion. The premises should logically entail the conclusion.\n2. **Claim**: A proposition that asserts something to be true or false, typically requiring justification or evidence.\n3. **Premise**: A proposition that provides evidence, justification, or logical support for a claim or conclusion.\n\n## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS\n1. **VERBATIM EXTRACTION ONLY**: Each ADU text must be copied EXACTLY from the paper with no modifications, paraphrasing, or combining of separate sentences.\n2. **NO HALLUCINATION**: Do not create, modify, or invent text that does not appear exactly in the source.\n3. **EXACT MATCHING**: Every word, punctuation mark, and spacing must match the original precisely.\n\n## DIRECTIONS\n1. **Identify Argumentative Discourse Units (ADUs)**  \n   - ADU = any contiguous text span functioning as a claim or a premise in the reasoning structure.\n   - **BE HIGHLY SELECTIVE**: Only include ADUs that are crucial to the overarching argument structure.\n   - Focus on significant claims and premises that contribute meaningfully to the argumentative flow.\n   - **AVOID NOISE**: Skip ADUs that are merely descriptive, tangential, or do not substantially advance the argument.\n   - Prioritize quality over quantity - fewer accurate, important ADUs are better than many insignificant ones.\n   - **EXTRACT ONLY**: Copy text spans exactly as they appear, without any modifications.\n2. **Classify each ADU**  \n   - Label = either `\"claim\"` or `\"premise\"`.  \n3. **Detect directed relations**  \n   - Relation = `\"support\"` or `\"attack\"`, from one ADU (source) to another (target).\n   - Map how ADUs connect to form reasoning chains.\n   - Focus on relationships between the most significant ADUs.\n   - Include relationships between premises that strengthen or weaken each other.\n4. **Verbatim spans**  \n   - Each `\"text\"` value must be copied EXACTLY from the paper with zero modifications.\n   - Do not paraphrase, summarize, or combine separate sentences.\n   - Do not add, remove, or change any words, punctuation, or spacing.\n   - If unsure about exact wording, skip that ADU rather than guess.\n\n## WHAT TO CAPTURE\n**INCLUDE ONLY:**\n- Main argumentative threads that are central to the paper's contribution\n- Core claims that represent the paper's primary arguments or findings\n- Key premises that provide essential support for major claims\n- Critical counterarguments and their refutations\n- Reasoning chains that demonstrate how main conclusions are derived\n\n**EXCLUDE (AVOID NOISE):**\n- Minor details, examples, or descriptive content that don't advance the argument\n- Tangential points or side discussions\n- Pure background information or literature review content\n- Methodological details unless they constitute argumentative claims\n- Obvious statements or commonly accepted facts\n- Redundant or repetitive argumentative content\n\n**GUIDING PRINCIPLE**: If removing an ADU would not significantly impact understanding of the paper's argumentative structure, it should be excluded.\n\n## QUALITY CONTROL\n- Before finalizing each ADU, verify the text exists exactly in the source\n- Prefer fewer, accurate ADUs over many potentially modified ones\n- When in doubt about exact wording, omit the ADU\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\nReturn **only** a single valid JSON object matching this schema.  \nDo **not** output any extra text, markdown, or explanations.\nDo **not** add comments.\n**RESPOND WITH ONLY**:\n```json\n{\n  \"ADUs\": {\n    \"<ADU_ID>\": {\n      \"text\": \"<exact span from paper>\",\n      \"label\": \"claim\" | \"premise\"\n    }\n    ...\n  },\n  \"relations\": [\n    {\n      \"source\": \"<ADU_ID>\",\n      \"target\": \"<ADU_ID>\",\n      \"type\": \"support\" | \"attack\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

At first sight, the prospects of such an endeavor appear rather dim. If the numbers of the manuscripts including optical texts extant in Prague libraries are considered, Prague seems anything but a center of optical studies. Nowadays, there are only two copies of Roger Bacon's Perspectiva (MS Prague, NK ČR, VIII E 27; MS Prague, NK ČR, VIII G 19) and three copies of John Peckham's textbook Perspectiva communis (MS Prague, KMK, L 29; MS Prague, KMK, L 41; MS Prague, NK ČR, adlig. 44 E 8), i.e. rather elementary renderings of optical science; while the scientifically more rigorous Alhacen, Witelo or Euclid are entirely lacking . The 1 si  tuation was probably no better in medieval times - according to the catalogs of the late medieval libraries of Prague University colleges, recently published by F. ŠmaThe 2018 Oxfam inequality report launched for the World Economic Forum in Davos (Switzerland) highlighted the sharp increase in inequality on a global scale over the last few years. According to this report, eighty-two per cent of the wealth generated in 2017 went to the richest one per cent of the global population, while the 3.7 billion people who make up the poorest half of the world saw no increase in their wealth. 1 In the same way, authors like Branko Milanovic have pointed out that we live in the most unequal era of history, and that this is a highly globalised and interconnected phenomenon which cannot be dealt with at the national level.  The effect of the 2 world wars and the crisis of the 1920s made it possible to reduce inequality and build a social model which, at least in the developed world, allowed for the emergence of a middle class and the so-called welfare state. This model was deeply shaken first by the conservative revolution of the 1980s and, more recently, by the global crisis of 2007-2008. All of this has in turn led to the emergence of national populism, as well as an alarming increase not only in economic and geographical inequalities, but in intergenerational ones as well. For the first time in decades, today young people in\n\n3\n\n* Work on this study received financial support from the Czech Science Foundation (GA ČR) project 'Philosophy at the University of Prague around 1409: Matěj of Knín's Quodlibet as a Crossroads of European Medieval Knowledge', grant n. 19-16793S, carried out at the Institute of Philosophy of the Czech Academy of Sciences.

Further, no commentary (or even 2 glosses) to any optical text of Prague origin has been discovered to date . 3\n\nThe small number of Prague optical manuscripts is particularly notable if manuscripts  from  the  same  period  kept  in  other  Central  European  university  centers (mainly Cracow and Vienna) are considered: there are eight extant copies of Peckham's Perspectiva communis from the fourteenth to fifteenth centuries in Cracow and seven copies in Vienna . Additionally, several commentaries on Peckham originated 4 at Cracow University , and Vienna University benefited from the presence of one of 5 the most famous late medieval commentators on perspectiva , Henry of Langenstein . 6\n\nIt may seem that there is nothing to investigate in Prague, that the extant   sources are too scarce to evaluate the role of optical science at the Prague Faculty of Arts. After  all,  this  is  the  honest  surrender  taken  by  Polish  science  historian  Grażyna Rosińska in her book on optics in the fifteenth century: she admits that in the absence of manuscripts, she was not able to investigate the optical tradition at Prague University, no matter how significant it might be . 7\n\n2 See Catalogi librorum vetustissimi Universitatis Pragensis / Die ältesten Bücherkataloge der Prager Universität , eds.

I, p. 573 and Lindberg, A Catalogue , p. 31). However, this codex was most likely written in Erfurt and the question itself was disputed there around 1350 by a disciple of Themo Judaei. See J. Pinborg, 'The 14th Century schools of Erfurt. Repertorium Erfordiense', in Cahiers de l'Institut du Moyen-Âge Grec et Latin , 41 (1982), p. 186. Although the copy of Sphaera materialis included in the same codex was used by the later owner of the codex, Petrus de Dwekaczowicz called Bibat, in his lectures on the same subject in 1448 and 1450 (see Truhl/u00E1.a/u0159.a, Catalogus , vol. I, p. 573), the perspectivist quaestio , as far as I know, had no significant influence on the Prague intellectual milieu. An edition of this quaestio is  under preparation by Jean Celeyrette, see J. Celeyre/t\\_t.ae, 'Une question de perspective disputée à Erfurt partiellement copiée sur une question d'Oresme', in Noctua , 5 (2019), p. 125-179.\n\nFurther, I discovered hitherto unknown anonymous questions on perspectiva in MS Prague, KMK, M 100, fols 69rb-72rb (I am preparing a new description of the codex and edition of the questions).

H. Steneck, Science and Creation in the Middle Ages: Henry of Langenstein (d. 1397) on Genesis , Notre Dame, University of Notre Dame Press, 1976, p. 9-22, for his tenets in optics and theory of light see p. 42-52.\n\n7 Rosi/u0144.aska, Optyka w XV wieku , p. 17-18.\n\nThe main aim of the present paper is to point out that efforts to investigate perspectiva in the context of late medieval Prague University are not so vain. As counting optical manuscripts kept in a local library is now neither the only nor the best way to judge the dissemination of perspectiva in this place in the later Middle Ages, I  suggest  other  ways  to  deal  with  the  issue  and  argue  that  there  are  other  types of sources to be considered. Therefore, section I inquires into studying optics at the Prague Faculty of Arts, highlighting both the faculty statutes and students' lists of the lectures actually attended. Also, it argues for a certain knowledge of optics among a considerable number of university members at least since the 1370s, by pointing to two lectures or commentaries (a philosophical one by Jenek of Prague and a theological one by Conrad of Soltau) whose authors assumed an acquaintance with perspectiva among their listeners. Section II draws attention to a type of source which - despite its arguable fruitfulness - has been under-investigated by historians of science: Prague quodlibetal disputations (1390s - 1410s), or the handbooks prepared by masters presiding over the quodlibets ( quodlibetarii ) and the elaborated positiones of the responding masters. Even a brief look at these texts reveals the acquaintance of the participants with optical auctoritates (e.g.  the  preparation of Simon of Tišnov [Šimon z Tišnova in Czech]). Finally, section III, the most extensive, represents the core of the paper and brings a thorough analysis of the question on the mechanism of vision ( Utrum sensationes fiunt per extramissiones virtutum ab organis sensitivis ) disputed by the Bohemian master John of Borotín (Iohannes de Borotin, 1378 - after 1458) in John Hus's quodlibet in 1411. The manuscript preservation of the question and its formal structure, as well as Borotín's sources and doctrinal position, are scrutinized. Borotín's question evinces that its author mastered John Peckham's textbook Perspectiva communis and adopted Peckham's view on the mechanism of vision, proposing a position intromissionist in general but also involving a kind of extramission. The paper also has two appendices - the first provides a description of part of MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 18 preserving Borotín's question, while Appendix II is a critical edition of the question.\n\n## 1. Studying Optics at the Prague Faculty of Arts\n\nFirst, it is worth premising what medieval optics is about. A marginal gloss in one of  the  Prague  manuscripts  of  Peckham's Perspectiva  communis introduces  a  brief definition of the discipline: 'Optics is a doctrinal science about light, colors and 'aspects' .' First, 8 perspectiva is called a 'doctrinal science' . In the Middle Ages, 'doctrinal sciences' are those abstracting away from the specific physical realization of the  object  under  consideration;  roughly,  mathematical  studies  -  besides  optics, arithmetic, geometry, or astronomy - are counted among them . They investigate 9\n\n8 Iohannes Peckham, Perspectiva communis , MS Prague, KMK, L 29, fol. 21r, in mg. sup. : 'Perspectiva est lucium, colorum et aspectuum doctrinalis sciencia.'\n\n9 See, e.g., Isidorus Hispalensis, Etymologiarum sive Originum libri XX , 2 vols, ed. W. M. Lindsay, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1911, III. Prol.; sometimes, the term 'scientia disciplinalis' is used; see Domini-\n\nsome features of nature (such as the propagation of light, its reflection or refraction in optics), but only insofar as they can be described using geometry. More Aristotelian classifications subsume optics (along with astronomy and harmonics) under the so-called 'middle sciences' ( scientiae mediae ) belonging both to mathematics and natural philosophy 10 .  Second,  the  gloss  determines  the  object  of  optics  -  it studies not only light and colors but also aspectus ,  i.e.  the  appearances  of  things (hence, some optical texts and the whole science are sometimes called 'de aspectibus'). In other words, medieval optics is not only a physics of the propagation of light but also an investigation of the physiological and even psychological processes behind visual acts. Hence, the scope of medieval perspectiva is considerably larger than that of present-day optics: whereas nowadays optics is a physical science about light and its properties, medieval optics is a conglomerate of physical, geometrical, physiological and even psychological inquiries 11 .\n\nThe blossoming of the perspectiva in Latin Europe came in the thirteenth century. Then, optics was one of the new sciences and was, as Roger Bacon says, both semi  nal for a knowledge of nature and neglected by his contemporaries 12 . Indeed, a full-fledged mastering of the optical science was scarce until the mid-thirteenth century. By that time, all of the important Greek and Arabic renderings of the discipline (i.e. works by Euclid, Ptolemy, Al-Kindi and especially Ibn al-Haytham, or Alhacen) had already been translated into Latin, and the discipline was assimilated and rendered into the context of Latin learning thanks to figures such as Roger Bacon, John Peckham and Witelo, who all authored textbooks or compendia of the optical science 13 .\n\nThereafter, perspectiva was  gradually  incorporated  into  the  curriculum  of philosophy studies at the studia of  some religious orders and faculties of arts 14 .\n\ncus Gundissalinus, De divisione philosophiae , ed. L. Baur, Münster, Aschendorff, 1903, prol., p. 15. The opposite of 'doctrinal' is a 'natural science' .\n\n10  See, e.g., Benedictus Hesse de Cracovia, Quaestiones disputatae super tres libros De anima Aristotelis (written in c. 1420s), MS Cracow, BJ, 2013, fols 8v-9r, cited by M. Markowski, Burydanizm w Polsce w okresie przedkopernikańskim , Wrocław, Ossolineum, 1971, p. 86: '[…] astronomia, perspectiva, musica […] aliqualiter participant de mathematica et aliqualiter de philosophia naturali, et ergo dicuntur sciencie medie inter mathematicam et philosophiam naturalem sicud […] perspectiva considerat de linea visuali, modo linea pertinet ad mathematicam sed visus ad naturalem.' For Hesse's sophisticated division of the sciences, see Markowski, Burydanizm w Polsce w okresie przedkopernikańskim , p. 53-56.\n\n11 See A. M. Smith, 'What is the History of Medieval Optics Really About?', in Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society , 148-2 (2004), p. 180-194, who argues that whereas modern optics is 'luminocentric', the pre-modern one was rather 'oculocentric' .\n\n12 Rogerius Bacon, 'Opus tertium', in Fr. Rogeri Bacon Opera quaedam hactenus inedita ,  vol. II, ed. J. S. Brewer, London, Longman, Green, Longman, and Roberts, 1859, p. 36-38.\n\n13 On the contributions of these three authors see D. C. Lindberg, Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler , Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1976, p. 107-121 or A. M. Smith, From Sight to Light: The Passage from Ancient to Modern Optics , Chicago / London, The University of Chicago Press, 2015, p. 260-277.\n\n14 Although it is neglected in this paper, the domain of perspectiva is not restricted only to the university milieu. As early as the late thirteenth century, perspectiva became a popular source for preachers. The moral dimensions of optical science are epitomized in the famous preaching manual De oculo morali by Peter of Limoges (written around 1280). This treatise was based on a careful study of Roger Bacon's Per-\n\nInterestingly, historians of science often mention that the earliest record in any university statutes to obligatory lectures on optics is, in fact, from Prague 15 . In the dean's book ( Liber decanorum ) of the Arts faculty, there is a statute enumerating which lectures a bachelor of arts must attend to be eligible for the master's exam. Lectures on Perspectiva communis (which is the most suitable for beginners of all the perspectivist texts) are included among other works from the fields of mathematics and astronomy 16 . This prescription is often dated 1390, like the entire Liber spectiva and original deduction of moral analogies and instructions from optical issues. On the place of De oculo morali in the perspectivist tradition see R. Newhauser, 'Inter Scientiam et Populum: Roger Bacon, Pierre de Limoges and the Tractatus moralis de oculo', in J. A. Aertsen, K. Emery, A. Speer (eds.), After the Condemnation of 1277.

Denery, Seeing and Being Seen in the Later Medieval World. Optics, Theology and Religious Life , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. 75-115.\n\nAlthough written at the University of Paris, it soon gained widespread dissemination outside universities and became a true medieval bestseller: there are more than 200 extant manuscripts of this text (Newhauser, 'Inter Scientiam et Populum', p. 688-689). It was obviously also read in the Bohemian lands. Even a quick look into the catalogs reveals a considerable number of copies of De oculo morali - e.g. in MSS Prague, NK ČR, I B 15; IV C 1; V C 10; VIII E 25; X B 24; XI C 8; XIV E 25; Prague, KMK, F 115; MSS Olomouc, Sbírka rukopisů Metropolitní kapituly u sv. Václava v Olomouci, CO 215; Olomouc, Vědecká knihovna, M II 79. There is also a copy of Bohemian origin now kept in Uppsala (MS Uppsala, Universitetsbiblioteket, C 641) which, according to its explicit, was written in Prague in the 1370s (note that the scribe was uncertain about the authorship and ascribed it to Thomas Bradwardine): 'Explicit tractatus de oculo morali a doctore profundo magistro thoma Brabd bradbardeyn ut fertur finitus prage anno domini MCCC septuagesimo 4°.'

It is highly probable that a future edition of Prague homiletical works will uncover at least some optical hints in the sermons, likely influenced by Peter of Limoges.\n\n- 15 See Lindberg, Theories of Vision , p. 121; Smith, From Sight to Light , p. 280-281.\n- 16 Statuta et Acta rectorum Universitatis Carolinae Pragensis 1360-1614 , ed. F. Šmahel, G. Silagi, Praha, Karo  linum, 2018, p. 243 (II. 27): 'Statutum fuit […] quod nullus magistrorum de facultate nostra, qui pro examinatore magistrandorum fuerit deputatus, aliquem ad tentamen admittat, nisi complete audiverit  libros  infra  scriptos,  videlicet  omnes  libros  Maioris  physice,  logicam  Aristotelis,  Ethicorum, Politicorum, Economicorum, sex libros Euclidis, [Iohannis de Sacrobosco] Spheram, [Campani Novariensis] Theoricam [planetarum], aliquid in musica et arismetica, Perspectivam communem [Iohannis de Peckham], De sensu et sensato, De somno et vigilia.' I split the phrase 'Spheram theoricam' into the two different astronomical works. See also Statuta et Acta rectorum Universitatis Carolinae Pragensis , p. 256 (V. 29), where it is stated that the lectures on Perspectiva communis should be conducted weekly for at least three months, but no longer than 14 weeks; and Statuta et Acta rectorum Universitatis Carolinae Pragensis , p. 260 (V. 40), where Perspectiva communis is listed among books that ought not to be taught on feast days.\n\nInterestingly, the Prague statutes are much more specific regarding mathematical (or quadrivial) disciplines than, e. g., the Parisian ones. A Parisian statute from 1366 includes only a general mention that a student striving for the license is required to attend lectures on 'some mathematical books' ( Chartularium Universitatis Parisiensis , 4 vols, eds. H. Denifle, A. Chatelain, Paris, Delalain, 1889-1897, vol. III, p. 145). In an older prescription, it is given more precisely that the bachelor should have attended 'at least a hundred lectures on maths' which means, e. g., 'one entire mathematical book, such as the treatise On sphere' completed and 'another book in progress' ( Chartularium , vol. II, p. 678).\n\ndecanorum ;  however,  what  is  called Liber  decanorum today  is  actually  a  'new' book created by then dean Matthias of Legnica, who also included older materials there 17 . As F. Šmahel points out, the statute article prescribing obligatory lectures on perspectiva is actually from the earliest stratum of the Liber decanorum, and its terminus ante quem is 1366 18 .\n\nHence, perspectiva might have been taught in Prague from at least the 1360s. Does a statute as a normative statement, though, entitle us to infer anything about actual practice? Obviously, further evidence is needed. A proof that attending optical  lectures was common practice among bachelors of arts can be gained from two lists of lectures attended by Prague students in the late 1380s 19 .  According to these, both students attended lectures on Peckham's Perspectiva communis delivered by Frederick of Drosendorf. The first student attended lectures on Perspectiva concurrently with lectures on Euclid and Theorica planetarum (all  three delivered by Drosendorf) 20 . The second student first heard lectures on the 2 nd and 3 rd books of Perspectiva communis (on  seeing by reflection and refraction, mirrors, lenses and some atmospheric phenomena), and only later lectures on the 1  book (on light, st anatomy and physiology of the visual organ, visual process and its condition and illusions) 21 .  Again, Drosendorf delivered all the lectures. However, since Drosendorf earned his master's degree in 1387 (and his performance at the exams was not particularly compelling), the quality and originality of his lectures on perspectiva delivered a year or two later is doubtful at best 22 .\n\nAnother testimony to Prague lectures on perspectiva is more than a decade older (and arguably the oldest one known today) - in a manuscript once kept in Halberstadt, a copy of Peckham's Perspectiva communis was accompanied by an explicit\n\n17 See Lindberg and Smith cited above (n. 15); on replacing the oldest book by Liber decanorum see F.

Possibly, the second student wanted to combine his classes thematically - he attended lectures on Aristotle's Meteorology concurrently with the lectures on Perspectiva communis II-III (at least partially) and on Aristotle's De sensu et sensato simultaneously with the lecture on Perspectiva communis I.\n\n22 See Šmahel, Die Prager Universität im Mittelalter , p. 325; for Drosendorf in Prague see also J. T/u0159.a/u00ED.a/u0161.aka, 'Příspěvky k středověké literární universitě I [Contributions to the Medieval Literary University I]', in Acta Universitatis Carolinae - Historia Universitatis Carolinae Pragensis , 9-1 (1968), p. 21. In the 1390s, we find Drosendorf in Vienna, studying medicine and teaching mathematical disciplines at the local university. He lectured on Perspectiva communis twice and on Proportiones breves , the abbreviation of Bradwardine's De proportionibus . See S. G/u00FC.anther, Geschichte des mathematischen Unterrichts im deutschen Mittelalter bis zum Jahre 1525 , Berlin, A. Hofmann &amp; Comp., 1887, p. 198-199. Later, he gained fame as the 'astrologer of Austria' and organized a disputation upon the appearance of the comet in 1402. He died in 1404. See M. H. Shank, 'Academic Consulting in Fifteenth-Century Vienna: The Case of Astrology', in E. Sylla, M.

The codex also included an optical treatise on the rainbow, but unfortunately, it is most likely lost today 24 .\n\nAnother, more indirect proof that Prague masters (and their students) were acquainted with optics in this early period are references to perspectivist texts made by them in lectures or commentaries on other works. The assumption here is that if a master refers to a perspectivist work or doctrine, he must know it, and it is also understandable to, and easily traceable and verifiable by, his listeners (as they have access to these texts in a library or have attended lectures on the issue). Two examples of such references can be introduced here - both texts are from the 1370s, to which the earliest evidence of optical lectures can be dated.\n\nThe first example is found in the commentary on De anima by Jenek of Prague (Jenco Wenceslai de Praga), usually dated 1375 25 . The references to optics are in the exposition of a passage in De anima II where Aristotle mentions kinds of objects which do not have any specific color in light, but which still appear luminous in darkness (he gives the examples of fungi or the scales or eyes of fish) 26 . This claim, however, seems to contradict the common Aristotelian conviction that what is seen is primarily the color and not the light. Commenting on this passage, Jenko first states that the issue pertains to the practitioners of perspectiva ( ad perspectivos pertinet ). He refers to Alhacen, whose explanation is that a more intense light somehow 'covers' the less intense one. A consequence is that a remote candle or stars are not visible in the daylight, but they are easily visible at night 27 .  Jenek  here evidently\n\n23  MS  Halberstadt,  Domgymnasium,  MS  217;  the  explicit,  cited  by  the  catalog  (G.  Schmidt,  'Die Handschriften  der  Gymnasial-Bibliothek  II',  in Königliches  Dom-Gymnasium  zu  Halberstadt.  Oster-Programm 1881 , Halberstadt, 1881, p. 20), is as follows: 'Finita est hec perspectiva communis magistri Johanis de Pysa anno Domini m.xxx.lxxiiij, in die s. Frederici imperatoris in honoranda universitate Pragensi, in domo medici imperatoris, per Allexium de Wratislavia, hora quinta decima.' This explicit has already been used by Šmahel, Die Prager Universität im Mittelalter , p. 107-108, 136 as proof that the lectures of the Prague Faculty of Medicine might initially have been delivered in the houses of royal doctors.\n\n24 The likely loss of the codex was suggested by Dr. Patrizia Carmassi (Herzog August Bibliothek, Wolfenbüttel) who was responsible for new cataloging of Halberstadt manuscripts, in an e-mail conversation from April 2017.\n\n25 On Jenek see P.

The date (or, at least, a terminus ante quem ) is based on the explicit of the commentary in MS Prague, NK ČR, VIII G 30, fol. 109r.\n\n26 Aristoteles, De anima II,  7,  419a1-7,  cf.  also  Averroes, Commentarium magnum in Aristotelis de ani  ma libros , ed. F. S. Crawford, Cambridge, MA, The Mediaeval Academy of America, 1953, II, 72, p. 239-240.\n\n27 Ienco Wenceslai de Praga, Commentarius in I-III libros De Anima Aristotelis , MS Prague, NK ČR, VIII G 30, fol. 70v: '[…] non omnes res sunt visibiles mediante aere illuminato […]. Quedam enim visibilia in lumine non videntur, sed in tenebra sub racione lucis, ut illa corpora que satis habent de igne in sua composicione, videntur in tenebris et sub racione qua lucent […] propter quam causam\n\nrefers to the second chapter of Alhacen's De aspectibus , book I, which is devoted to these kinds of situations 28 .\n\nAnother  example  may  be  found  in  a  theological  text  -  the  commentary  on Sentences by Conrad of Soltau, who lectured on Sentences in Prague around 1380 29 . Perspectivist influences are usually concentrated in one particular place in Sentences commentaries - the thirteenth distinction of book II, devoted to the issue of creation of light. Theologians had here an opportunity to show their proficiency in optics, dealing with such issues as the nature of light, its propagation, colors and so on 30 . In his rather brief treatment of the question, Soltau refers four times to optical science or directly to Peckham's Perspectiva communis (in one case, he even makes an exact reference to a specific proposition of Peckham's) 31 .\n\nHowever, does Soltau not borrow these references from another source? After all, his commentary is significantly influenced by the corresponding work of Thom-\n\nhec in tenebris sunt visibilia alia racio est, i.e. ad perspectivos pertinet, qui dicunt, quia sunt luminosa unde generaliter vel videntur tamquam proprium sensibile a visu nisi color et lumen, de die autem non videntur, quia lumen maius occultat multa visibilia que minus lucent, oportet per Alacen. Eciam lumen minus non videtur in lumine maiori secundum perspectivos. Est causa: sicud sonus maior ocultat minorem, sic lumen maius ocultat minus. Hec eciam est causa, quare candela de nocte accensa videtur a remotis et non de die et quare stelle apparent de nocte et non de die.'\n\n28 Cf. Alhacen, 'De aspectibus, I-III', ed. A. M. Smith, in A. M. Smith, Alhacen's Theory of Visual Perception , Philadelphia, American Philosophical Society, 2001, I. 2, §4. 8 and 4. 10, p. 5-6. A similar solution was also proposed in the Buridanian tradition of De anima commentaries. See (Pseudo-)Iohannes Buridanus, 'Expositio De anima', ed. B. Patar, in B. Patar, Le Traité de l'âme de Jean Buridan [De prima lectura].

Patar, Nicolai Oresme Expositio et quaestiones in Aristotelis De anima , Louvain / Paris, Éditions Peeters, 1995, II. 4, 1, p. 42-43; however, none of them mentions perspectiva in this passage, which renders the possibility that Jenek just borrowed the reference from another commentary unlikely. Note that Buridan's authorship of the exposition of De anima edited and ascribed to him by B. Patar has recently been seriously contested - see S. W. De Boer, P. J. J. Bakker, 'Is John Buridan the Author of the Anonymous Traité de l' âme Edited by Benoît Patar?', in Bulletin de philosophie médiévale , 53 (2011), p. 283-332. I therefore refer to the text as by pseudo -Buridan.\n\n- 29 On Conrad of Soltau see T/u0159.a/u00ED.a/u0161.aka, 'Příspěvky I' , p. 14; J.

On the one hand, Conrad evidently draws his inspiration from Thomas of Strasbourg in dividing the distinction into four articuli 33 ; he also shares Thomas's stance in all four cases (in one instance with an explicit reference to him) 34 .  Nevertheless, with one exception (different from Conrad), Thomas does not refer  to  optics  or  Peckham. Even if Conrad's rendering of the question was a mere abbreviation of the one by Thomas, then, Conrad's perspectivist hints would be his own 35 .  It may thus be concluded that writing his commentary  on Sentences ,  Conrad  of  Soltau  was  equipped  with  certain  optical knowledge and might count on the same among his listeners.\n\nTo summarize, the optical texts (chiefly Peckham, but perhaps also Alhacen) were known to Prague masters and students as early as in the 1370s - lectures on optics were delivered then, and the tenets of the discipline were referred to in both philosophical and theological texts.\n\n## 2. Discussing Optics in Prague Quodlibets (c. 1394-1417)\n\nAlthough acquaintance with perspectiva among the members of Prague University is already attested in the 1370s, there is substantially richer evidence of optical knowledge in Prague from the 1390s to the beginning of the Hussite Wars - namely, Prague quodlibetal disputations that took place at the Faculty of Arts 36 . As the questions on optics-related issues are rather numerous, this section is selective 37 . It  lists  the optical questions disputed in the quodlibets, briefly summarizes their topics, and focuses on how this kind of source can be utilized as evidence for the dissemination of perspectiva in the Prague University milieu (on the example of a question included in the quodlibet by Simon of Tišnov). As the rest of the paper is devoted to the question on vision disputed by John of Borotín in the 1411 quodlibet chaired by John Hus, Hus's preparation for the disputation with Borotín is briefly considered here, and its Wycliffian source is uncovered.\n\n32 Schabel, Brinzei, Maga, 'A Golden Age of Theology at Prague', p. 32.\n\n33 Compare Conrad's text with Thomas de Argentina, Commentaria in IV libros Sententiarum , Venice, Iordanus Ziletti, 1564, II. 13, fols 155rb-156va.\n\n34 Conradus de Soltau, Sent. II. 13, MS Prague, NK ČR, I D 23, fols 72vb-73ra: 'Quantum ad 2 m articulum dicit Tomas de Argentina quod non sunt eiusdem nature lumen vel lux corporum celestium et istorum inferiorum […].'\n\n35 E.g. Conrad's solution of the 4 th article is (contrary to that of Thomas) a mere statement that the issue is already solved in perspectiva .\n\n36 The fact that perspectiva remained an obligatory part of the university curriculum even after the secession of the German masters in 1409 is attested by a brief mention made by John Hus in his Quodlibet . Hus, introducing the young master Elias de Tyn (who had earned his master's degree in 1410), stresses that Elias had devoted himself to study of perspectiva recently. See Iohannes Hus, Quodlibet ,  ed. B. Ryba, Turnhout, Brepols, 2006, q. 52, p. 240-241: '[…] Magister E&lt;lias&gt; de T&lt;yn&gt; […] illi sciencie [scil.  perspective]  hoc  anno  specialiter  in  leccione  deditus,  scolas  nostras  in  hac  materia  clarissime informabit.'\n\n37 The author of this paper is preparing another study devoted precisely to the issue of perspectiva in Prague quodlibets.\n\nFirst,  it  is  worth  emphasizing  that  the  Prague  quodlibets  differ  substantially from the traditional ones in several aspects 38 . The traditional quodlibets (from the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries) were organized at theological faculties or the studia of different religious orders. A prominent theologian (deputized by his bachelor) had to answer whatever question was put by any member of the academic community, and then face counter-arguments to his solution. After this first part of the disputation, the master reorganized the questions according to similarities in their topics, summarized the discussions and stated his position on each of the questions (this elaborated version of his positions was called the determinatio ), and introduced it to the community several days later. After that, he sometimes refined his text into a final version intended for distribution ( ordinatio ) 39 . Thus, traditional quodlibets are often original and profound texts produced by the best scholars at the peak of their careers.\n\nBy contrast, the Prague quodlibets were instead a collaborative enterprise. The quodlibets we have evidence for were held at the Faculty of Arts .  The role of the master organizing the session was radically different: he did not answer the questions, but put them. The quodlibetarius had to prepare a question for each master of the faculty (often regarding the field of expertise of the latter) and then present counter-arguments against the latter's solution. Thus, the quodlibetarius prepared a handbook of these questions, including several counter-arguments against both positive and negative solutions to each question (as he did not know which of the options the responding master would choose, the quodlibetarius had to prepare for any of them). Since positiones of the responding masters are rather rarely extant, the actual handbooks of the quodlibetarii (or  rather copies of them) are the best source we have for the study of the Prague quodlibets. Obviously, in this case, we confront a specific kind of source. These preparations often do not include any con-\n\n38 For quodlibets (both as specific disputation sessions organized at medieval universities and studia and as a special kind of written sources) in general see J.

Moreover, the quodlibetarius might help himself by copying the preparation from another kind of source (see Hus below). However, when the preparation is not copied down word for word, it may still reveal what sources the quodlibetarius had at his disposal when he was preparing for the disputation (see Simon of Tišnov below).\n\nToday, no less than fourteen quodlibetarii from the period between 1394 and 1417 are known at least by name 40 .  Further, there are extant handbooks by seven of them: Henry of Ribenice (1394?), Matthias of Legnica (1399?), John Arsen of Langenfeld (1400?), Matthias of Knín (1409), John Hus (1411), Simon of Tišnov (1416) and Prokop of Kladruby (1417). Each of their handbooks is preserved in a single manuscript, and they have not yet been edited except for the handbook by Hus edited by Bohumil Ryba.\n\nWhen the lists of questions from of all of these quodlibets are examined 41 , no less than 13 questions relating explicitly to optics may be identified. All the quodlibetarii (except Arsen) included at least one perspectivist question in their handbooks:\n\n## Henry of Ribenice (MS Leipzig, Universitätsbibliothek, Ms 1414)\n\n- (1)  q. 48: Utrum radius visualis frangatur in occursu medii rarioris seu densioris\n\n## Matthias of Legnica (MS Stralsund, Stadtarchiv, Hs 1067, fols 207r-279r)\n\n- (2)  q. 85: Utrum visio facta sub pyramide radiosa fiat extra mittendo vel recipiendo\n\n## Matthias of Knín (MS Prague, KMK, L 45)\n\n- (3)  q. 37: Utrum species qualitatum per se sensibilium existat in medio realiter et subiective\n- (4) q. 72 (73): Utrum demonstrabile est iridem tantum tricolorem peripheriam circuli apparere\n- (5)  q. 114 (116): Utrum visio facta sub pyramide radiosa fiat intus suscipiendo vel extramittendo\n- (6)  q.  137  (140): Utrum multiplicatio luminis per medium uniforme sit uniformiter difformis\n\n40 The list of all known quodlibets, extant manuscripts and literature on each of them is in Šmahel, Die Prager Universität im Mittelalter , p. 377-381. Besides the quodlibets listed by Šmahel, I found what seems to be another Prague quodlibet in two Cracow manuscripts - in MS Cracow, BJ, 649 and (slightly abbreviated) in MS Cracow, BJ, 624 (which also preserves several abbreviated questions from Ribenice's quodlibet ). Arguably, both codices are of Prague origin, include a set of questions on various topics with problemata and a discussion on the quaestio principalis . Both codices can be dated to before 1400 on the basis of watermarks. They are described in M. Kowalczyk et al., Catalogus codicum manuscriptorum medii aevi latinorum qui in Bibliotheca Jagellonica Cracoviae asservantur , 9 vols, Wrocław, Ossolineum, 1980-2008, vol.

Two questions are dedicated to specific optical phenomena, namely the rainbow and mirror images (nos. 4 and 12). Whereas Knín prepared a question on whether there can be demonstrative science about the rainbow 42 , Prokop of Kladruby deals with the metaphysical nature of the images appearing in mirrors. Both gather arguments about the metaphysical nature of these phenomena: are they qualities existing in a full-fledged way, or mere appearances with somewhat diminished extramental existence?\n\nOther questions deal with human vision and the eyes (no. 7 and 10): Hus wanted to discuss the Aristotelian definition of vision; Tišnov prepared a fascinating question on the conditions of vision, apparently deeply influenced by perspectivist authors (see below). Finally, the mechanism of vision - i.e. whether an observer sees by intromission (receiving stimuli) or extramission (emitting something from\n\n42 Of all the questions listed above, Knín's seems to be the only one which has been studied by a modern scholar. See Koc/u00E1.anov/u00E1.a, 'The Sublunary Phaenomena' , p. 77-78.\n\nhis eyes) - figures prominently in four of these six handbooks (nos. 2, 5, 9, and 13.) The question disputed by Borotín is one of them.\n\nSome of these questions are Aristotelian both by their topic and the sources quoted in them 43 .  As for the perspectivist authors, the most quoted is, unsurprisingly, John Peckham; some quodlibetarii also refer to Alhacen. Nevertheless, in the context of tracing perspectivist influences, there is one interesting preparation with no counterpart in any known Prague quodlibet - that proposed by Simon of Tišnov (no. 10) 44 .\n\nThe question's title already reveals an apparent familiarity with perspectiva .  It asks whether there are eight conditions to be met for vision to be veridical - a standard issue in perspectivist literature 45 . When introducing these conditions, Simon of Tišnov even refers directly to Alhacen's De aspectibus and enumerates that for vision to be veridical, the object must be remote from and opposite the eyes, illuminated, and of a proper quantity and density, while the air must be transparent and the eye healthy, and a moment of time is needed 46 .\n\nFurthermore,  Tišnov's  preparation  includes  the  most  significant  number  of references to perspectivist texts of all the quodlibetal questions mentioned. I have counted 31 references in total; not only to the Peckham's textbook but also to texts known rather to specialists in optical science:\n\n| Peckham, Perspectiva communis   |   17 | Bacon, Perspectiva      |   2 |\n|---------------------------------|------|-------------------------|-----|\n| Alhacen, De aspectibus          |    8 | Euclid, De visu         |   1 |\n| Witelo, Perspectiva             |    2 | Al-Kindi, De aspectibus |   1 |\n\nReferences to Peckham 47 and Alhacen are direct - to a concrete proposition or chapter, which may indicate that Tišnov had these texts in front of his eyes. Two references to Bacon are interesting: the first is very vague (Bacon is just a name in a list of perspectivists) 48 , while the second comprises two pieces of text quoted by Tišnov and ascribed to 'someone writing about natural philosophy' ( quidam naturaliter\n\n43 As further research will probably reveal, some of them are derived from Aristotelian commentaries on, e.g., De sensu et sensato or Meteorologica .\n\n44 Simon de Tissnow, Quodlibet , MS Prague, Knihovna Národního muzea, V C 42, q. 46, fols 131v-133v.\n\n45 See Alhacen, De aspectibus III, 3, §3.1-3, p. 285; Rogerius Bacon, 'Perspectiva', in D.

Lindberg (ed.), John Pecham and the Science of Optics , Madison / Milwaukee / London, University of Wisconsin Press, 1970, I. 47 (50) - 54 (57), p. 130-134.\n\n46 Simon de Tissnow, Quodlibet ,  q.  46,  MS  Prague,  Knihovna  Národního  muzea,  V  C  42,  fol.  131v: 'Quod questio sit vera pro quesito, arguitur auctoritate Alhacen 3  libro sue o Perspective , capitulo 3 quod intitulatur 'capitulum de causis, quibus visui accidit decepcio', sic dicentis: quibus completur comprehensio visi, secundum quod est, sunt octo: remocio, opposicio, lux, quantitas, corporis densitas, dyafaneitas aeris, tempus, sanitas visus. Hiis ergo omnibus aggregatis visum comprehenditur vera visione.'\n\n47 Peckham is cited as 'Pisanus', which is a common mistake in late medieval manuscripts.\n\n48 Simon de Tissnow, Quodlibet , q. 46, MS Prague, Knihovna Národního muzea, V C 42, fol. 132r: '[…] maior patet ex primo Perspective Alhacen et Pisani et omnium Perspectivistarum, Bacon&lt;is&gt; et Vitellonis etc.'\n\nscribens ) 49 . Al-Kindi is quoted once as a proponent of an Aristotelian position unusual among the perspectivists - that light spreads out in an instant and hence what we see, we see immediately 50 .  As for the arguments, the preparation seems to be written by somebody well-versed in state-of-the-art perspectivist works 51 .\n\nDespite poor manuscript evidence, as stated in the introduction, some of the Prague quodlibetal questions - and primarily that by Simon of Tišnov - testify to not negligible degrees of knowledge of perspectiva 52 . Tišnov's question, though, - no matter how interesting - remains a preparation for discussion (and it is not even certain that it was really discussed during the quodlibetal session). As mentioned, the only optics-related question where both the preparation by the quodlibetarius and the positio by the responding master are extant is Borotín's question on the mechanism of vision proposed to him by John Hus. Since the rest of the paper is devoted to Borotín's positio ,  this section ends with a brief look at Hus's preparation for this question and its sources 53 .\n\nHus's preparation for the question of whether sensations are by sensory powers being emitted is rather brief and sketchy. Although several arguments both neganti and concedenti are gathered, all the arguments are ultimately for extramission. The first group of arguments is designed for a situation in which Borotín denies extramission ( neganti ) and defend a kind of syncretic account combining extramission with intromission. The second group is prepared for the case that Borotín accepts intromission ( concedenti, quod fit intus suscipiendo ) - and is thus against intromission, defending extramission again. Obviously, Hus counted on Borotín's acceptance of the much more common intromissionist view 54 .\n\nAs Hus's preparation is strongly derivative, it is interesting to trace his sources. Although one expects a commentary on De sensu or a perspectivist work as a chief\n\n49 Simon de Tissnow, Quodlibet , q. 46, MS Prague, Knihovna Národního muzea, V C 42, fol. 132v: 'In oppositum arguitur et primo contra supposita et primo, quia questio supponit quod oculus componitur ex quattuor tunicis. Contra hoc arguitur sic: non est compositus oculus ex quattuor tunicis, igitur illud primum suppositum questionis est falsum. […] Hoc idem patet auctoritate cuiusdam naturaliter scribentis circa materiam de oculis, questione 2é capitulo 2 , sic dicentis: 'Oculus autem habet tres o tunicas seu panniculos et tres humores et unam telam ad modum tele aranee [= Bacon, Perspectiva I, 2, 2, p. 26] . ' Et in eodem capitulo circa finem dicit: ' Aliqui eciam VII tunicas posuerunt, sed falsum est, quia telam araneam pro tunica computaverunt [= Bacon, Perspectiva I. 2, 2, p. 28]. ''\n\n50 On the context of the medieval debate see D. C. Lindberg, 'Medieval Latin Theories of the Speed of Light', in R. Taton (ed.), Roemer et la vitesse de la lumière , Paris, Vrin, 1978, p. 45-72.\n\n51 The profundity and originality of this preparation are also surprising, as Tišnov's quodlibet is traditionally supposed to be heavily influenced by earlier quodlibetal handbooks. Cf. Kej/u0159.a, Kvodlibetní disputace , p. 97-101; Šmahel, Die Prager Universität im Mittelalter , p. 369 counts 15 questions copied from Knín's quodlibet by Tišnov.\n\n52 Besides optics-oriented questions, references to perspectivist authorities also appear in other questions on different topics. For example, Zdeněk of Labouň (Zdenko de Labun) in the question debated in Hus's quodlibet explains some optical phenomena such as the rainbow or halo as a result of refraction of sunlight in the atmosphere and refers several times to the Perspectiva by Witelo, i.e. to a highly technical compendium of optics. Unlike Tišnov's vague reference to Witelo, Labouň refers to specific propositions, which may indicate that he has the text before his eyes. See Zdenko de Labun, 'Questio astronomicalis', ed. B. Koc/u00E1.anov/u00E1.a, in ead., 'Questio astronomicalis Zdeňka z Labouně: Kritická edice [Questio astronomicalis by Zdeněk of Labouň: A Critical Edition]', in Listy filologické , 139 (2016), §3.7, p. 158-159.\n\n53 The preparation is edited in Iohannes Hus, Quodlibet , q. 56, p. 254-256.\n\n54 As will be scrutinized below, Borotín accepted a syncretic account in the end.\n\nsource for such a question, Hus is faithful to his favorite thinker John Wyclif even here and borrows a considerable portion of the text from Wyclif's theological masterpiece Trialogus , namely from a chapter on sensation in the first anthropological part of the work 55 . On the other hand, it is not so surprising if one takes into consideration both Wyclif's intense interest in the science of perspectiva 56 and the popularity of Wyclif's works among reformist Bohemian masters (concentrated around John Hus and Jerome of Prague) 57 .\n\nThus, even the title of Hus's question prepared for Borotín is borrowed from Wyclif:\n\n| Iohannes Hus, Quodlibet , q. 56 58                                                                                                                                                                                           | Iohannes Wyclif, Trialogus , II, 7 59                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| […] Hanc autem difficultatem […] Magister Io<hannes> de B<orotin> […] nostro auditorio declarabit.

Istam materiam nec tractas philosophice neque fundas, imo difficultas utrum autem sen- sationes fiunt per extramissiones virtutum ab organis , cum aliis difficultatibus, praetermittis […]. |\n\nIn the neganti section,  Hus  then utilizes Wyclif's chapter on sensation, where the evangelical doctor defends a middle position between intromission and extramission. Hus's first argument (inspired by the second part of Wyclif's text) asserts that vision itself is on the intersection of an extension of the (imaginary) visual ray and cathetus , i.e., a line drawn through the object perpendicular to the surface of the mirror (The perspectivist dictum used here pertains to the issue of the location of the mirror images; unlike Wyclif, Hus mentions the context of mirror perception only at the very end of the argument). As the intersection is (usually) behind the mirror and hence outside the eyes, Hus's concludes that vision must be by extramission 60 .\n\n55 Iohannes Wyclif, Trialogus, cum Supplemento Trialogi ,  ed. G. Lechler, Oxford, Clarendon, 1869, II. 7,  p.  97-98.  Note  that  although  Hus's  dependence  on Trialogus in  q.  56  is  unnoticed  by  editor B. Ryba, he identifies several borrowings from Wyclif's Opus evangelicum in q. 52 (on the multiplication of light). See Iohannes Hus, Quodlibet , q. 52, p. 240-246.\n\n56 Copious evidence is provided by H. Phillips, 'John Wyclif and the Optics of the Eucharist', in A. Hudson, M. Wilks (eds.), From Ockham to Wyclif , Oxford / New York, Basil Blackwell, 1987, p. 245-258.\n\n57 On the dissemination of Wyclif's works in Bohemia in the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries and his influence on Prague University masters see V. Herold, Pražská univerzita a Wyclif [Prague University and Wyclif], Praha, Univerzita Karlova, 1985; Šmahel, Die Prager Universität im Mittelalter , p. 467-489 (chapter on 'Wyclif's Fortune in Hussite Bohemia'); or O.

Van Dussen (eds.), Europe after Wyclif , New York, Fordham University Press, 2017, p. 89-114. According to his own testimony, Wyclif's Trialogus was copied in Oxford and brought back to Bohemia by Jerome of Prague himself. See Pavl/u00ED.a/u010D.aek, 'Wyclif 's Early Reception' , p. 94. F. Šmahel, Verzeichnis der Quellen zum Prager Universalienstreit 1348-1500 , Wrocław, Ossolineum, 1980, p. 16-17 lists five copies of Wyclif's Trialogus of Bohemian origin; all of them are today in Vienna (MSS Vienna, ÖNB, Cod. 1387; 3930; 3932; 4505; 4516). There is also evidence - although questionable - that Trialogus was translated into Czech by John Hus himself. See F. M. Barto/u0161.a, Literární činnost M. J.

Comparison of these three variants of the same argument reveals how Albert's argument becomes more and more abbreviated (and less clear):\n\n| Iohannes Hus, Quodlibet , q. 56 70                                                                                                                                                                                     | Ma/t_t.ahias de Knin, Quodlibet , q. 114 (116) 71                                                                                                                                              | Albertus Magnus, De sensu et sensato , I, 6 72                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Concedenti, quod fit intus sus- cipiendo: […].

Even the present sketch, however, reveals that perspectivist issues were quite popular in the quodlibets, and that in their preparations the quodlibetarii utilized not only almost all the important perspectivist texts (Simon  of  Tišnov),  but  also  unexpected  theological  and  philosophical  sources popular among Bohemian masters (Wyclif used by Hus). Finally, the quodlibetarii also apparently exploited quodlibetal preparations by their former colleagues (as Hus's use of Knín suggests).\n\n## 3. John of Borotín's Quaestio on the Mechanism of Vision\n\nAs already noted, the main problem one must face investigating the presence of optical issues in the Prague quodlibets is the specific nature of the extant written sources - almost all the optical questions are preserved only in the form of preparations gathered in the handbooks by quodlibetarii before the disputations themselves.  This  kind  of  source  cannot  reveal  what  the  discussion  was  like,  or  which position the responding master held. There is however one exception - a positio (elaborated response to the question in written form) by the Czech master John of Borotín, who disputed a question on the mechanism of vision in the quodlibet by John Hus in 1411. The rest of this paper is devoted to Borotín, and to analysis of his question, which is also edited below (see Appendix II).\n\n## 3.1 Borotín's Life and Works\n\nJohn of Borotín was born in 1378, studied the arts at Prague University, and earned his bachelor's degree there in 1400 and master's in 1410. He then lectured and held several positions at the university for almost half of a century until his death (after 1458) 74 . As a fresh master of arts, he had still been attending university lectures in\n\n73 qualitas ] coni. quans cod.\n\n74 Borotín was dispensator (1414 and 1416), dean of the Faculty of Arts (1415 and again 1432), examiner of bachelors (1417 and again 1450) and rector of the whole university (1425-1426). Initially, he was also rector of  a  minor school in Zderaz (in 1412). On his life and service to the university see J. T/u0159.a/u00ED.a/u0161.aka, Literární činnost předhusitské university [Literary Work of the Pre-Hussite University], Praha, Universita Karlova, 1967, p. 166, 173; K. Ber/u00E1.anek, 'O počátcích pražské lékařské fakulty 1348-1622 [On the\n\nthe 1410s. This part of his career is well documented because he wrote down a series of lectures that he attended in his personal codex (today MS Prague, KMK, O 1), which is also useful for identifying Borotín's hand 75 . Evidently, he had a special interest in the astronomical disciplines. From the lecture reports and several dated first-person glosses it can be surmised that he attended a number of introductory lectures on astronomy in 1411: MS Prague, KMK, O 1 preserves an introductory text on De utilitatibus astrolabii by Christian of Prachatice (Křišťan z Prachatic in Czech, fols 37r-37v), an introduction to astronomy with a division of astronomical and astrological disciplines (38r-39r) and commentaries on Sphaera materialis (39v-45v) and Theorica planetarum (46r-47v, 49r-65r) 76 . Borotín then attended lectures on Thabit ibn Qurra's introduction to Ptolemy's Almagest (in 1412, fols 126r-129r) given by John Šindel (Iohannes Andreae Schindel), and Šindel's lectures on the Almagest itself  (in  1413,  fols  138r-161v) 77 ,  as  well  as  lectures on Alcabitius (in 1413, fols 72r-89v) and Alfraganus's De differentiis (in 1414, fols 181v-222r). Marginal glosses and introductory notes written in Borotín's hand indicate that he used these reportationes and excerpts several decades later when he was lecturing these texts 78 .\n\nBeginnings of the Prague Faculty of Medicine]', in Acta Universitatis Carolinae - Historia Universitatis Carolinae Pragensis , 9-2 (1968), p. 79; Šmahel, Die Prager Universität im Mittelalter , p. 146, 303-306; and esp.

The following passage includes several precisions and additions to Borotín's bibliography.\n\n75 On  the  contents  of  the  codex,  see  Patera,  Podlaha, Soupis  rukopisů , vol. II, p. 452-453; A.

David Juste is preparing a new description of the codex. The codex is in large part Borotín's autograph, as recently argued by Burne/t\\_t.a, 'Teaching', esp. p. 11-13 (the main arguments are the notes in the first person, some of them including Borotín's name). Borotín's hand is idiosyncratic - wide, very cursive and not easy to read.\n\n- 76 Traditionally, it was surmised that the text on fols 37r-65r is a copy of a text on the astrolabe (perhaps by Christian), because of a gloss on fol. 37r ('Principium in tractatum C[ristiani] De utilitatibus astrolabii 1411 […].') and a gloss on fol. 66r following this part of the codex ('1452 incepi legere Alkabicium fer&lt;ia&gt; tertia ante Ascensionem Domini ego M. Io&lt;hannes de&gt; Bo&lt;rotin&gt;'), where 'Alkabicium' was read as 'Astrolabium' . See Patera, Podlaha, Soupis rukopisů ,  vol.  II,  p.  452;  Burne/t\\_t.a, 'T eaching' , p. 13-14 also seems to incline to it. This surmise was refuted by Hadravov/u00E1.a, Hadrava, Křišťan z Prachatic , p. 77-78; who prepared editions of both Compositio astrolabii and Usus astrolabii by Christian (see Hadravov/u00E1.a, Hadrava, Křišťan z Prachatic , p. 133-171, 201-281). A closer look at these passages reveals that the text is actually a series of different commentaries, as stated above.\n\n77 On these texts, see D. Juste, 'Johannes Andree Schindel, Lectures on Thebit Bencora's De hiis que indigent expositione antequam legatur Almagesti ' (update: 30.03.2017), Ptolemaeus Arabus et Latinus. Works , accessible from: https://ptolemaeus.badw.de/work/120, and D. Juste, 'Johannes Andree Schindel, Lectures on the Almagest ' (update: 21.03.2017), Ptolemaeus Arabus et Latinus. Work s, accessible from: https://ptolemaeus.badw.de/work/77. On Schindel (1370s - between 1455 and 1458), the famous Bohemian astronomer and probable designer of the Prague astronomical clock, see, e.g., Spunar, Repertorium , vol. I, p. 133-140 and the study by Alena Hadravová and Petr Hadrava in this volume.\n\n78 This was pointed out by Burne/t\\_t.a, 'Teaching', for Borotín's lectures on Alcabitius.\n\nIn the 1410s, Borotín also participated as one of the responding masters in three quodlibetal  disputations.  He  responded  to  a  question  on  extramission  and  the mechanism of vision in John Hus's quodlibet in  1411 79 ,  a  question on mathematical disciplines and their principles in a quodlibet organized by Michael of Malenice called Čížek in 1412 80 ,  and  a  question on the generation of stones and metals in Prokop of Kladruby's quodlibet in 1417 81 .\n\nLater, during his long career as a teacher, Borotín lectured on several books of natural philosophy, astronomy and medicine. Some of his commentaries are preserved - either as his own preparations for lectures or as marginal glosses in copies of the texts he lectured on, written down as reportationes by his students. In the 1420s he lectured on medical texts - on Hippocrates's Aphorisms (1424, Borotín's brief introduction is preserved in MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 23, fol. 49r) and Isagoge Iohanitii (1430, glosses in MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 16, fols 15r-20r) and later, on Aristotle's Meteorology (1433, glosses in MS Prague, NK ČR, VII E 9, fols 107r-174v) 82 . In the final part of his life, he focused mainly on astronomy and astrology, giving lectures on Ptolemy's Quadripartitum (1444, glosses in MS Cracow, BJ, 593) 83 , Campanus of Novara's Theorica planetarum (1449, introductory notes in MS Prague, KMK, O 1, fols 129v-130r), Alfraganus's De differentiis (1450) 84 and on Alcabitius's Introduction to Astrology (in 1452 and 1454) 85 . Besides that, there are two undated commentaries written in Borotín's hand - a continuation of an exposition on the Alfonsine tables (MS Prague, KMK, O 1, fols 114r-115v) and a commentary on Euclid's Elements (MS\n\n79 Utrum sensationes fiunt per extramissiones virtutum ab organis sensitivis , preserved in MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 18, fols 58r-61r and analyzed and edited below.\n\n80 Utrum omne principium mathematicae, cuius obiectum primarium est quantitas, sit necessarium , preserved also in MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 18, fols 94v-101v.\n\n81 Utrum lapides et metalla generari in nubibus sit possibile quemadmodum in visceribus terre -  Borotín's position is not extant, there is only the quodlibetarius Prokop's preparation in MS Prague, KMK, L 27, fols 40v-41r (on which see also Koc/u00E1.anov/u00E1.a, 'The Sublunary Phaenomena', p. 94-95).\n\n82 There is also a note in MS Prague, KMK, O 1, fol. 222v (basically several paragraphs on the issue of why some regions are uninhabitable), the title of which suggests Borotín lectured on Meteorology as early as 1420: '1420 circa leccionem Metheororum M&lt;agistri&gt; J&lt;ohannis de&gt; B&lt;orotin&gt;.'\n\n83 The codex is described by M. Kowalczyk et al., Catalogus ,  vol.  IV ,  p.  144-148  and  D.  Juste, 'MS Cracow, Biblioteka Jagiellońska, 593' (update: 25.02.2017), Ptolemaeus Arabus et Latinus. Manuscripts , accessible from: https://ptolemaeus.badw.de/ms/182.\n\n84 There is testimony that Borotín lectured on Alfraganus in a list of university lectures preserved in the rear endpaper in MS Prague, KMK, L 43 (and transcribed in Tříška, Literární činnost ,  p.  173): 'Item Iohannes Borotin eodem anno [=1450] legit Alfraganum De differentiis; incepit f. III  ante Zophie.' No a commentary is extant; however, Borotín might have based his teaching on the lectures he attended in 1414 and wrote down in MS Prague, KMK, O 1.\n\n85 Borotín started to lecture on Alcabitius in 1452 (see MS Prague, KMK, O 1, fol. 66r) but apparently changed his mind - see MS Prague, KMK, O 1, fol. 66r: 'Et dicenda minori&lt;bu&gt;s sunt minora verba divi - dicamus igitur aliquid minori pro intelligendo isto libro […]. Et quia iste liber subservit astronomie, cum sit introductorius in iudicia astrorum, aliquid igitur pro noticia astronomie hic dicemus ante omnia et post hoc incipiemus istum librum dei auxilio.' He then lectured on Alcabitius again in 1454. See his preamble in O.1, fols 130r-v (edited by Burne/t\\_t.a, 'Teaching', p. 26-27), where he mentions that he had lectured on the book before but stopped (Burne/t\\_t.a, 'Teaching', p. 26, §3). The preamble ends with a cross-reference to fol. 72r, where the commentary written in 1413 starts, indicating that Borotín lectured on Alcabitius in 1454 according to his student notes from 1413.\n\nPrague, KMK, O 1, fols 165r-178r; with a long borrowing from Alan of Lille's Anticlaudianus III on geometry in the introduction). There are also mentions of Borotín's lectures on plague ( de pestilentia ) and of him as an expert on computus 86 .\n\nBorotín was evidently engaged in the quadrivium or mathematical disciplines in the broad sense, mainly in astronomy. However, does perspectiva have a special place in his thinking? It does not seem so. E.g. in the commentary glosses to Meteorology ascribed to him, the glosses to book III (a traditional place for investigating optical phenomena, such as the rainbow) are rare and short, and serve merely as explanations of difficult expressions 87 . Although he presented several methodological remarks about perspectiva in the question on mathematical principles disputed in Čížek's quodlibet 88 , the most evident influence of the optical tradition is to be found in his earliest text, the question on the mechanism of vision disputed in Hus's quodlibet .\n\n## 3.2 Utrum sensationes : Two Versions of the Text\n\nThe final redaction of Borotín's question Utrum sensationes (preserved in Prague, NK ČR, X H 18 and edited below in Appendix II) 89 consists of a brief propositio (§1-3) with basic arguments pro and contra and problema , a section including notabilia where Borotín investigates all the terms included in the title of the question (§5-28), and finally a section with conclusions and corollaries where Borotín's stance  is  presented  (§29-39).  The  text  itself  does  not  contain  any  information concerning its authorship. Nevertheless, the title of the question matches the one included in John Hus's handbook, and the propositio section is copied from Hus's preparation verbatim . Moreover, since Hus ascribes the question to John of Borotín and calls him 'a new Avicenna,' referring to Borotín's skills in medicine and optics 90 , there is no doubt that the author of the position in MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 18 is John of Borotín.\n\nThe text as preserved in MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 18 has a slightly more complicated structure. In the first place, the part of the codex under discussion includes two versions of Borotín's question. The first redaction is shorter and sketchier, con-\n\n86 See Spunar, Repertorium , vol. I, p. 42.\n\n87 See  Iohannes  de  Borot/u00ED.an, Epitome  Meteorologicorum  Aristotelis ,  MS  Prague,  NK  ČR,  VII  E  9, fols 152v-161r (book III) and especially tractatus 2 on fols 154r-161r which is 'de passionibus causatis ex refraccione radiorum solis aut lune' (fol. 152v, in mg.). Glosses explain terms for optical atmospheric phenomena such as the halo, parhelia etc. On fol. 157r a gloss points out that Aristotle speaks about vision as if it were by extramission ('Perloquitur de visu quod sit extramittendo.' See also note 124 below.). Several diagrams are included, e.g. the origin of the halo (155v), the colors of rainbow (158r) and its origin (159r, 159v, 160r).\n\n88 Here,  Borotín  explains  in  what  sense perspectiva is  subordinated  to  geometry.  See  Iohannes  de Borot/u00ED.an, Utrum omne principium , MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 18, fol. 97v.\n\n89 For reference, I use the paragraph numbers of the edition.\n\n90 Iohannes Hus, Quodlibet , q. 56, p. 255: 'Hanc autem difficultatem venerandus Magister noster, Magister Io&lt;hannes&gt; de B&lt;orotin&gt;, cum sit preclarus perspectivus et medicus, velud Avicenna alius, nostro auditorio declarabit.'; Iohannes Hus, Quodlibet , p. 281: 'Illic Iohannes Borotyn, ut Avicenna, sensaciones, qualiter fiunt intus suscipiendo et extramittendo, cum ceteris difficultatibus conpendiosissime declarabat.'\n\ntaining many crossed phrases, interlinear and marginal glosses, and consisting only of notabilia . It is written on a single bifolio; however, due to binding, the text is on the folios both before and after the second version (fols 57r-57v, 62r-62v) 91 .  The second version seems complete, as it includes not only notabilia but also conclusions and corollaries. There are also fewer cross-outs and glosses. After the text of the second version, there are several notes in the manuscript. As they relate to the main text (as argued below), I involve them in the edition (§40-43). The hand of the scribe is very cursive and, importantly, is the same for all the texts mentioned.\n\nThere are several indications which suggest that the exemplar of Borotín's question preserved in MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 18 is an autograph. The first (albeit not particularly persuasive) indication is that the hand of the scribe of Utrum sensationes is very similar to Borotín's handwriting preserved in MS Prague, KMK, O 1. Secondly,  another  question Utrum  omne  principium  mathematicae , disputed  by Borotín in the following year, is preserved in the same codex and shares both the idiosyncratic hand and complicated structure typical of Utrum sensationes . It also includes the beginning of the question, with propositio and first notabile (Prague, NK ČR, X H 18, fol. 94v) and then another version of the beginning with an additional division (95r). Further, there are notabilia , conclusions and corollaries (95r-99v); and the final version of the question is again followed by what can be considered preparatory notes that mirror the structure of the question itself (100r-101v). It is possible that two quires with Borotín's personal writings were bound (with many other disputed questions) into this collected volume.\n\nThe most persuasive reason for declaring Utrum sensationes an autograph, however, is a comparison of the two versions of the question. This comparison suggests that the scribe had worked extensively on the text, adding new parts and rearranging the old ones, refining the style, etc. Sometimes, too, a marginal gloss in the first version is extended and becomes a part of the main text in the second. All of this suggests that the scribe is identical to the author. The comparison reveals that the first version functions as preparatory notes for the second version, which is in turn carefully constructed as a final version of the text.\n\nSometimes Borotín changes the preparatory text because he finds a more suitable authority. For example, defining the term virtus (the soul's capacity to perform an action, e.g. a cognitive one), the preparatory version refers to Aristotle's definition of virtus as a habit that perfects and renders good both its bearer and his deeds, and identifies virtus with spiritus ,  understood physiologically with Avicenna as a 'subtle vapour' (fol. 57v). These are not, however, particularly convenient definitions when the virtus in dispute is a power of soul as Aristotle's definition relates rather to a moral or intellectual virtue, whereas Avicenna is talking about the physiological vehicle which is behind the workings of the power. Borotín was aware of this unsuitability, and in the final version, he proposes an entirely different definition which he borrowed from Bartholomaeus Anglicus: power is an essential attri-\n\n91 For a more detailed description of this part of MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 18 and more information about the gatherings see Appendix I.\n\nbute of the soul by means of which the soul performs its actions in the body (§14). Nevertheless, Borotín still found Aristotle's definition worth mentioning, and thus he put it after the final version of the question as an additional remark (§40), where he applies Aristotle's definition of virtue to the case of the soul's power, stressing that sensory power renders the workings of body perfect and good.\n\n| Preparatory notes fol. 57v                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Final version fol. 58v = §14                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Additional note fol. 61r = §40                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Dixi 3 o quod ad sensacionem re- quiritur virtus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Dixi 3 o quod ad sensacionem re- quiritur virtus que est causa effi- ciens sensacionis, ut dicit Con- stantinus in Pantegni .                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Unde virtus 92 - licet apud phi- losophos multipliciter accipitur, tamen pro presenti materia                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Unde ly 'virtus' apud philoso- phos multipliciter accipitur; in presenti tamen materia summitur virtus pro quadam po- tencia anime per quam ipsa suas operaciones exercet in corpore et describendum sic:                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| potest sic describi: 'virtus naturalis 93 est habitus 94 , que habentem se perficit et opus eius bonum reddit, 95 ' ut dicit Philosophus Ethicorum ; vel po- test dici spiritus, qui - ut dicit Avicenna I o Canonis , fen I a - est vapor subtilis ex sanguine reso- lutus ad totum corpus multipli- catus 96 . | 'Virtus est potencia anime ei essencialiter attributa ad suas peragendas in corpore acciones, nam mediante hac virtute anima corpus vivificat, cor et arterias constringit continue et dilatat, sensum et motum voluntarium omni animato corpori admini- strat, ut dicit idem Constantinus libro 13 in Pantegni 97 .

The definitions of virtutes (see below) in Borotín's preparatory notes, for example, are rather brief (fol. 57v), while the same passage in the final version is detailed and consists above all of borrowings from Bartholomaeus (see §15-21). It seems that Borotín discovered the usefulness of Bartholomaeus's encyclopedia for his purposes after he had already written the major part of his preparatory notes. Tacit borrowings from Bartholomaeus, although numerous in the final version, are completely absent from the preparatory notes. Sometimes it seems that Borotín realized he could improve his text with a quotation from Bartholomaeus while finalizing it. For ex-\n\n92 virtus ] sic describitur add. sed del.\n\n93 naturalis ] suprascr.\n\n94 habitus ] suprascr.\n\n95 Aristoteles, Ethica Nicomachea II, 5, 1106a15-24.\n\n96 Possibly Avicenna, Liber canonis , Basel, Johannes Herwagen, 1556, I. 1, 6, 4, fols 49-50.\n\n97 Bartholomaeus Anglicus, De proprietatibus rerum , vol. I: Prohemium, Libri I-IV, eds. B. Van den Abeele, H. Meyer, M. W. Twomey, B. Roling, R. J. Long, Turhnout, Brepols, 2007 [hereafter abbreviated as DPR I-IV], III. 14, p. 162.\n\nample, he excerpted a short passage on saliva and its role in the sense of taste from Bartholomaeus and placed it after the whole text of the preparatory notes (fol. 62v). Then, writing the final version and discussing the object of taste, he notes that what is perceptible to the sense of taste must be humid and adds a quotation from Aristotle's De anima . He might, however, have recollected the excerpt on saliva, crossed out Aristotle's saying, added these several lines on saliva from Bartholomaeus and, finally, added Aristotle's dictum again after that (see §25).\n\nThe claim that the scribe of the text may be the author himself is further confirmed by notes appended to the final version of the text (§40-43). At least some of these seem to be an outcome of a rereading and rethinking of the final version carried out by the author himself. The corollary to the first conclusion (§30), for example, states that the sensible per se does not bring about the sensation. To give precision to this statement, he later adds what 'per se' means here: he superscribed 'secundum esse reale', making clear that the statement pertains only to the sensible in its real being. Nevertheless, the distinction between the real and intentional being of the sensible, no matter how common in the medieval philosophical literature, had not previously been introduced in the text. He therefore adds a marginal gloss 'hic nota' to this place, which is most likely a cross-reference to one of the notes after the text (see §43). Here, on fol. 61v, the marginal 'hic' appears again next to the text that begins 'nota […]', and explains the distinction between esse reale and esse intentionale .\n\nIn the corollary to the fourth conclusion (§37), Borotín introduces the notion of the visual cone. He says that there is both a cone constituted by species multiplied from the sensible object and a cone constituted by species of the eye emitted from the eye (on the doctrine, see below). At the end of the corollary, however, Borotín speaks about three cones. This seeming mistake can be explained if one has Bartholomaeus's text in mind. In his discussion of vision, Bartholomaeus introduced the third cone. Besides the two cones from the object and the eye, there is a further cone of light. Borotín also had this passage on the necessity of light for vision in mind, which is proven by the fact that he includes it among the notes after the question (see §42).\n\nThese examples reveal that the question Utrum sensationes , as preserved in MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 18, is a genuine work-in-progress, its two versions representing two stages of the text formation, as the former includes many notes which in the latter were carefully elaborated, edited and refined by a scribe who, in all probability, is to be identified with the author himself.\n\n## 3.3 Utrum sensationes : Borotín's Sources\n\nAt first sight, Borotín's question appears to be quite revealing regarding its sources. There are numerous explicit references, mainly to Aristotle (10×), Constantine the African and his Pantegni (8×), and Peckham (or 'auctor Perspective communis '  -6×). It is however unclear to what extent, or even whether, Borotín worked with the actual texts of these authors (at least in the case of Aristotle and Constantine). Tracing Borotín's references reveals a considerable discrepancy between who is explicitly referred to, and from whom the passage is borrowed (see the table below). When the actual borrowings are considered, Borotín's most prominent source is -\n\nperhaps surprisingly - Bartholomaeus Anglicus and his encyclopedia De proprietatibus rerum (especially book III on human psychology) 98 .  Although almost never indicated,  there  are  no  less  than  twenty-three  borrowings  from  Bartholomaeus, some of them quite extensive 99 .\n\nSometimes Borotín uses Bartholomaues as a source for other authors' positions. It is highly probable that Borotín did not work with Constantine's Pantegni , Calcidius's commentary to Plato's Timaeus , or Aristotle's De animalibus . Although he names these works several times, in all cases either the reference to them is a part of a literal borrowing from Bartholomaeus (hence, it seems as if he quoted from these authors themselves - see, e.g., §14, 15, 20, 38) 100 ,  or Borotín deliberately ascribes quotations from Bartholomaeus to another, perhaps more eminent authority (especially to Constantine, as in §19, 25, or 27) 101 .\n\nNevertheless, it is very likely that Borotín had copies of two other sources before his eyes - Peckham's optical textbook Perspectiva communis and Galen's compendium De locis affectis (referred to by him as De interioribus ). In the case of Peckham, Borotín refers to specific propositions using correct numbering, and often quotes them literally (see §8, 10, 36, 41); sometimes he also accepts and rephrases Peckham's doctrine (see §32). The three quotations of Galen's De interioribus are less accurate, but at least one of them is still traceable (see §18) 102 .\n\n98  Bartholomaeus's encyclopedia (finished about 1240 in Saxony) was apparently popular in the Bohemian Lands. H. Meyer, Die  Enzyklopädie  des  Bartholomäus  Anglicus:  Untersuchungen  zur  Überlieferungs-  und  Rezeptionsgeschichte  von  'De  Proprietatibus  Rerum' , München, Wilhelm Fink Verlag, 2000, lists six codices which preserve an original Latin version (p. 99-101) and two other redactions or compilations (p. 171, 177) now kept in Prague libraries, all from the fourteenth or fifteenth century and most of them of Czech origin. Two copies of Bartholomaeus are also mentioned in late medieval catalogs of Prague University libraries. See Catalogi librorum vetustissimi Universitatis Pragensis , p. 127 (N I: Q48, Q49). Later in the fifteenth century, Paul Žídek used Bartholomaeus for his own encyclopedia. See A. Hadravov/u00E1.a, Kniha dvacatera umění mistra Pavla Žídka: část přírodovědná [Master Paul Žídek's Book of Twenty Arts. The Natural Sciences Part], Praha, Academia, 2008, p. 47-48.\n\n99 There is one unwitting reference to Bartholomaeus's text in §21 of Borotín's quaestio .  Borotín,  introducing three kinds of bodily spirit, compiles this paragraph out of excerpts from chapter III, 22 of Bartholomaeus's encyclopedia. Having tacitly borrowed Bartholomaeus's claim that the spirit is generated in the liver,  Borotín  avoids  summarizing  Bartholomaeus's  scrupulous  exposition  of  the propagation of spiritus through other organs by reference (where 'post presentem' means 'after the just quoted passage from Bartholomaeus') to his source: 'Quaere post presentem de generacione huius spiritus.'\n\n100\n\nHence, Borotín's reference to Calcidius in §20 cannot unfortunately be used as further evidence for the dissemination and popularity of his commentary to Plato's Timaeus among Bohemian masters around 1400. On Platonist influences on Prague University masters see, e.g., E. Jeauneau, 'Plato apud Bohemos', in Mediaeval Studies , 41 (1979), p. 161-214, esp. p. 162-168; Herold, Pražská univerzita a Wyclif , p. 230-231; or Pavl/u00ED.a/u010D.aek, 'Wyclif 's Early Reception' , who listed numerous borrowings in the works by Borotín's contemporary Jerome of Prague (p. 100, 113).\n\n101 Such a practice might have been common among Bohemian scholars. Use of Bartholomaeus's encyclopedia is proven in the Czech lexicographer Claret (Bartholomaeus de Solencia in Latin, Bartoloměj z Chlumce in Czech) a half-century before Borotín. See, e.g., A. Vidmanov/u00E1.a, 'Mistr Klaret a jeho spisy [Master Claret and His Writings]', in Listy filologické , 103-4 (1980), p. 221.\n\n102 Borotín probably used a copy of Galen when working on his preparatory notes, whereas he prepared the final version without further reference to it. When discussing the faculty of movement ( virtus\n\n| Source                                                 | Explicit references   | Actual borrowings (as identified in the edition below)   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Bartholomaeus Anglicus, De proprietatibus rerum        | -                     | 23                                                       |\n| Aristotle (various works)                              | 10                    | 8                                                        |\n| Peckham, Perspectiva communis                          | 6                     | 6                                                        |\n| Averroes (various works)                               | 2                     | 3                                                        |\n| Galenus, De interioribus                               | 3                     | 3 (?)                                                    |\n| Constantinus Africanus ( Pantegni or unspecified work) | 8                     | 1 (?)                                                    |\n| Calcidius, Super Timaeum                               | 1                     | -                                                        |\n\nSometimes Borotín uses  terminology  or  phrases  from  Buridanian De  anima commentaries; this terminology, however, was so common that it is impossible to trace his exact sources (see, e.g., §27, 35). Further, he introduces an argument very similar to one proposed by John of Jandun in his De sensu commentary (see §35 and the respective note). Borotín might have had access to Jandun's works 103 , although Jandun's argument might also have become a part of later tradition and Borotín could have encounter it in another work. Also, the definition of sensation that Borotín incidentally added in the margin at the beginning of the notabilia section may be borrowed from 10 th -century Jewish philosopher Isaac Israeli (see §7).\n\nFinally,  there  is  no  link  between  the  quodlibetal  preparation  by  Hus  and Borotín's positio except the fact that the propositio of Hus's preparation and Borotín's question (in both preliminary and final versions) are identical 104 . Borotín, however, neither addresses any of Hus's arguments nor makes any indication that he was acquainted with Hus's preparation for disputation. The explanation suggesting itself is that Borotín received the propositio before the quodlibetal disputation, prepared a written determination of the question which he then presented during the ses-\n\n103\n\nmotiva ), Borotín mentions Galen's example of a patient hit in his spine, whose three fingers lost the capability to move while they remained able to feel (see §18). Nevertheless, Galen described precisely the opposite case: the patient lost the sense in his fingers, but could move them (Galenus, 'De interioribus', in Quarta impressio ornatissima continens omnes Galeni libros , ed. Rusticus Placentinus, Pavia, De Burgofranco, 1515, I. 6, vol. II, fol. 27rb: '[…] dixit sensum digitorum a triginta diebus esse ablatum, motus vero digitorum permansit […].'). Interestingly, Borotín rephrased Galen correctly in the preparatory notes (see fol. 62r: '[…] narrat Galenus I o De interioribus de quodam homine, qui amiserat sensum in tribus digitis, motum tamen non amisit.') but adjusted this example in the final version. Borotín's acquaintance with the so-called 'new Galen' may be considered a further proof of his connection to the Faculty of Medicine, which is sometimes suggested but founded only on indirect evidence. See Ber/u00E1.anek, 'O počátcích', p. 79; Šmahel, Die Prager Universität im Mittelalter , p. 146. The  notes  on De  anima written  in  Borotín's  hand  preceding  the quaestio encompass  a  variant  of andun's theory of two substantial forms of the human being, namely, cogitative and intellective soul. J Compare MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 18, fol. 56v with Iohannes de Ianduno, Super libros Aristotelis de Anima subtilissimae quaestiones ,  Venice, Hieronymus Scotus, 1552, fol. 71ra. On Borotín's notes on the human intellect, see Appendix I. Jandun's commentary on De anima is also mentioned in the catalogs of Prague University libraries; see Catalogi librorum vetustissimi Universitatis Pragensis , p. 40 (shelfmark R II: G27), p. 139 (shelfmark N II: D18).\n\n104 Compare §1-3 in the edition (and the beginning of Borotín's preparatory notes in MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 18, fol. 57r) with Hus's preparation in Hus, Quodlibet , q. 56, p. 255.\n\nsion. His question as preserved in MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 18 originated before the session itself, as it does not seem to reflect either Hus's preparation or the discussion that probably followed Borotín's performance 105 .  Further, it is also uncertain whether Borotín read his positio in its entirety during the session, as it is quite long (and a little tedious in its notabilia section) and 54 masters were responding to a question in Hus's quodlibet that lasted only a couple of days 106 .  Hus noted at the end of his handbook that Borotín responded very concisely ( conpendiosissime ) 107 .\n\nNevertheless, another interpretation is possible. Borotín might have presented his preliminary version of the text, which includes merely the notabilia ;  in  other words, he might just have explained the meanings of all the words employed in the title of the question. Only after the discussion with Hus, might he have prepared the final version of the question intended for distribution, where he takes the syncretic position connecting intromissionist and extramissionist accounts of perception, paying homage not only to Peckham but also to Wyclif, the source of Hus's preparation. The issue of the exact shape of the Prague quodlibetal disputations remains undecided 108 .\n\n## 3.4 Borotín's Position in the Dispute over the Mechanism of Vision\n\nOnce textual issues and Borotín's sources have been investigated, the doctrinal aspects of the question can be scrutinized. The question asks 'whether sensations occur by the [sensory] powers being emitted out of the sensitive organs' ( Utrum sensationes fiunt per extramissiones virtutum ab organis sensitivis ) and is thus devoted to the issue of what the mechanism of vision is. This issue arose even in Ancient philosophy and science, and was still popular in the Latin Middle Ages. As pre-modern optics concerned not only the physics of light but also the physiology and psychology of seeing, it became one of the crucial questions investigated in optical science. The history of pre-modern optics is often narrated as a clash between two competing answers to this issue, i.e. intromission and extramission. Some authors (such as Democritus or Aristotle) proposed an intromissionist explanation of the visual mechanism as they claimed that we see by receiving an entity in our sight. For Aristotle, for example, such an entity is a causal effect of the quality (color) of the external object ( eidos or species ) that first actualizes the medium between the object and the observer, and then the observer's power of sight. Other authors (such as Plato, Euclid or Galen) favoured the extramissionist explanation of vision: our sight must issue forth or emit an entity in order to see. Such an entity is a visual\n\n105 In his pivotal book on Prague quodlibets, Jiří Kejř argues that such was a common practice. According to Liber decanorum ,  the quodlibetarius had to deliver the topic of the question to every responding master three or four days before the session (see Kej/u0159.a, Kvodlibetní disputace , p. 28); extant positiones of various masters reflect neither the actual discussion (Kej/u0159.a, Kvodlibetní disputace , p. 62-63) nor the quodlibetarius ' s preparation (except in just one case, see Kej/u0159.a, Kvodlibetní disputace , p. 67-68).\n\n106 Kej/u0159.a, Kvodlibetní disputace , p. 92.\n\n107 See quotation in note 90.\n\n108 I thank Ota Pavlíček, who prepares an up-to-date study on the processual aspect of Prague quodlibetal disputations, for his insights into the matter.\n\nray of fire or light nature for Platonists or Euclidians; for Galenists, it is a visual spirit or pneuma 109 .\n\nSometimes historians argue that the dispute was settled as early as in the eleventh century by the Muslim scientist Alhacen, who united all the traditions and elaborated  a  powerful  explanatory  optical  paradigm  based  on  intromission  and denying extramission 110 . Nevertheless, some Latin perspectivists of the thirteenth century (esp. Roger Bacon and John Peckham), although heavily influenced by Alhacen and proposing intromission, still made room for extramission 111 .  The question of intromission and extramission had therefore not been answered once and for all for Latin medieval scholars. It has the status of a problema (an unsettled issue where both positions are equally attractive), and was thus ideal for quodlibetal disputations - and as pointed out above, a question on extramission vs intromission was included in almost every Prague quodlibet .\n\nResponding  to  the  question  given  to  him  by  Hus,  Borotín  chooses  what  is called by his contemporary Zdeněk of Labouň the 'ancient way' ( modus antiquus ), i.e. to first define all of the terms included in the title of the question (rather than to divide the response into a series of articles, which is the modus modernus ) 112 . In terms of word count, this notabilia section is the longest as it occupies c. 58/u0025.o of the text (whereas the section with conclusions occupies only c. 26/u0025.o and the additional notes only 14/u0025.o). Further, Borotín is sometimes verbose in the notabilia . He seems to forget that the question is restricted only to the visual power and adds more information about faculty psychology in general, or organs and media of all the senses, which eventually turns the notabilia section into a general introduction to the theory of the sensitive soul and its operations.\n\nIn the notabilia section, there is a palpable tension between Aristotelian influence and the more Platonizing tendencies delivered by Bartholomaeus Anglicus (whose encyclopedia predates the broad dissemination of Aristotle's psychology after c. 1240s and hence still bears the seal of the twelfth-century Platonic- and Galenic-oriented philosophy) 113 .  Sometimes, Borotín tries to assume a compromise position; sometimes he sides with Bartholomew. For example, Borotín follows Aristotle's lead when he defines what sensory perception ( sensatio ) amounts to be. The sensation is a kind of apprehension realized when a species (i.e. a similitude) of the object is impressed on a sense (§5). The species is a sensible accidental form of the object (e.g. color); however, it is abstracted from the material realization that it has when inhering in the object. In this frame, Borotín also introduces the famous Aristotelian analogy with wax and\n\n109 For the dispute among Ancient thinkers, see Lindberg, Theories of Vision , p. 1-17 and Smith, From Sight to Light , p. 23-75.\n\n110 E.g. Lindberg, Theories of Vision , p. 58-86, esp. 85-86.\n\n111 See Lindberg, Theories of Vision , p. 107-121 or Smith, From Sight to Light , p. 256-273.\n\n112 Zdenko de Labun, Questio astronomicalis ,  §3, p. 135 : '[…] respondeatur secundum modum antiquum, videlicet simpliciter declarando ea, que ponuntur in titulo questionis, sine hoc, quod questio ipsa in multos articulos distingwatur, qui est modus modernus.'\n\n113 R. J. Long, the editor of book III of DPR , stresses the influence of the pseudo-Augustinian work De spiritu et anima and also medical tradition, esp. Constantine the African. See Bartholomaeus, DPR , p. 139-142.\n\nseal (§7). He does not, though, seem to agree with more Aristotelian-minded thinkers in reducing the sensation to a passive reception of species (although he mentions this Aristotelian position in §7). Influenced by Bartholomew, he acknowledges the more Platonic view that the efficient cause of the sensory act is the sensory soul (or its power) itself (§12, 14) 114 . An apparent conflict between these two views is resolved by distinguishing between (principal) efficient causality and an instrumental one. The sensation is apprehension effectuated by both the species (as the instrumental cause) and the sensory power (as the efficient cause) (§5).\n\nAnother example is the issue of the nature of eye, concerning which there was a debate between Aristotelians and Platonists. On the one hand, Aristotelians proposing intromission stressed the ability of the eye-jelly to receive impressions, inferred that it must be easily malleable and concluded that eyes are of a watery nature 115 . On the other hand, Platonists surmised that eyes are of an igneous nature and that their inner light or spirit may emit forth. A fiery nature is also ascribed to the eyes by Bartholomaeus Anglicus 116 . Borotín admits that - insofar as its ability to receive impressions is considered - the eye may be called watery, but its proper nature is different. Borotín wants to assign one element to each of the senses - and as the organ of hearing is airy, that of taste is watery, that of smell is fiery, and that of touch is dominated by the element earth (§9), the element which remains for vision is the aether 117 . Borotín's statement is not to be pushed too far (and read as an ascription of a special celestial nature to the eyes); he simply wants to emphasize that the eyes have a sort of natural light which participates somehow (see below) in the visual process. He supports this claim by reference to Peckham's Perspectiva communis (§8) 118 . Later in the additional notes (§41), Borotín repeats that eyes are of an aetherous nature and compares them to celestial bodies. Just as some stars are warmer and have stronger rays while others have only diminished light, so various animals have visual powers of different strengths. Borotín concludes that some animals have eyes with more natural light than humans, and are able to emit stronger visual rays, which is supported by popular extramissionist anecdotes (also mentioned by Peckham) - cats or wolves allegedly see in darkness, and the lynx is even able to see through walls 119 .\n\n114 See esp. Bartholomaeus, DPR III, 17, p. 167 (for vision); 18, p. 172 (hearing); 19, p. 174 (smell); 20, p. 176 (taste); 21, p. 178 (touch). The ascription of a causal role to the soul's power is typical of  the  Platonic  and  Galenic  tradition.  See,  e.g.,  William  of  Conches, Glosae  super  Platonem , ed. E. A. Jeauneau, Turnhout, Brepols, 2006, II, 148, p. 267 or Constantinus Africanus, 'Pantegni', in Ysaac, Omnia opera , 2 vols, Lyon, 1515, vol. II, fols 1ra-144ra, here Theorica IV. 10, fol. 17ra.\n\n115 See Aristoteles, De sensu 2 where he criticizes his predecessors and states his position.\n\n116 Bartholomaeus, DPR III, 17, p. 167: 'Sensus igitur visus, cum sit igneus, est simplicissimus […].'\n\n117 Such a matching of elements and sensory organs has a long tradition in pre-modern philosophy. See, e.g.,  Augustinus, De Genesi ad litteram libri duodecim ,  ed.  J.  Zycha,  Prag  /  Wien  /  Leipzig, F. Tempsky, 1894, III. 4, p. 66-67 who, however, assigns a fiery nature to sight. Aether was regarded as a special fifth element of a very subtle, fiery and crystalline nature, located above normal air and a constituent of celestial spheres.\n\n118 Peckham, Perspectiva communis I, 46 (49), p. 128-130. However, Peckham does not explicitly assign an aetherous nature to the eyes; he seems to accept the Aristotelian position about their watery nature. Cf. Peckham, Perspectiva communis I, 31 (34), p. 112.\n\n119 Cf. Peckham, Perspectiva communis I, 46 (49), p. 128-130; 51 (54), p. 132.\n\nAnother example from the notabilia section of Borotín siding with medical authors rather than Aristotelians is his classification of the soul's powers ( virtutes ). While the fundamental division for Aristotelians is into vegetative, sensory and rational faculties, Borotín introduces a Galenic division which can be found in Constantinus, and which he borrows from Bartholomaeus Anglicus. There are three basic  powers  (§14-20):  (1)  natural  power  ( virtus  naturalis ),  responsible  for  the vegetative functions of the body; (2) vital power ( virtus vitalis ) which brings life to  the  individual body; and animal power ( virtus  animalis ),  responsible for cognitive functions and locomotion. All of these powers are embodied. Natural power originates from the liver, vital power has its seat in the heart and is diffused by the arteries throughout the body, and animal power is seated in the brain. Borotín also borrows the medical notion of spiritus (§21) which is a subtle matter diffused through the body which, in Platonic thinking, plays the role of mediator between the immaterial soul and material body. There are three kinds of spiritus corresponding to the three powers (natural, vital and animal).\n\nIn a brief but important remark closing his exposition of powers and spiritus (§21), Borotín qualifies the meaning of the term 'extramission' included in the title of the question. In his view, what is emitted is not a body of a luminous or fiery nature (e.g. a ray of inner light, as Platonists would maintain), but precisely these powers, namely, the sensitive  ones.  As  will  become  obvious  in  the  conclusions, such  a  qualification  enables  Borotín  to  hold  a  compromise  position  between intromission and extramission.\n\nThe influences of the three sources quoted most frequently by Borotín - Bartholomew's encyclopedia, Aristotle, and Peckham's Perspectiva communis - are not present equally in all the sections. As pointed out, Bartholomew's domain is the notabilia section, whereas Aristotle's and Peckham's influences are more evident in the section with conclusions. Responding to the central issue of the text - whether vision is  by  extramission  -  Borotín  continues to balance between opposing authorities.\n\nInitially, he proposes a version of an Aristotelian intromissionist account of vision. He begins with an evident intuition that every sensation is in its proper sensory organ (conclusion 1, §29) and not outside of it, as the extramissionists seem to imply. This intuition is corroborated not only by Aristotle's authority in De sensu but also by reasoning: if the efficient cause of the sensory act is the sensory power - and Borotín (under Bartholomew's influence) agrees with this - then since the power is in the organ, its effect is in the same place.\n\nHowever, the sensible object itself is  not present and efficacious in the sensory organ as seeing a green color, the eye does not actually become green. Borotín states this in the corollary (§30), and solves the problem by the Aristotelian distinction between the real and intentional being of the sensible (he adds the proper expression of the distinction as an additional note after the text, as pointed out above - see §43). Every sensible object can thus replicate (or, in perspectivist terminology, 'multiply') its causal effects through the medium. These effects are the so-called species , i.e. similitudes having mere intentional being (concl. 2, §31).\n\nThe question remains as to how the presence of the seen object in the eyes (its repraesentatio ) is provided. Does it occur by extramission of the powers towards\n\nthe objects or by receiving their species in the senses? Borotín uses this dilemma to argue against extramission in a way influenced by Peckham 120 . If extramission were the case, then the power would not only issue from the eye, reach the object and stop there. As the sensation occurs in the organs, the power would have to return to the eye and 'announce' the object to it. Such a conception is however absurd. Emitted powers would have to be animated, even rational and capable of voluntary movements, as they would go forth and return. Therefore, intromission appears to be a better option. Sensation occurs by species of the objects, multiplied through the medium and impressed in the eyes, which in turn cause the acts of sensation (concl. 3, §34). Additionally, every power whose operation is immanent (i.e. which produces nothing besides itself) is actualized only if it receives something from outside. The extramissionist explanation of vision would lead to a counter-intuitive conception of vision: the visual power would always be actualized (and never in potentiality), and its operation would not be immanent (§35). Intromission is thus a more plausible way to explain the mechanism of vision.\n\nBorotín's response could end right after conclusion 3. In that case, his position would amount to an Aristotelian intromissionist account of vision. However, he adds another conclusion which - perhaps surprisingly - rehabilitates extramission. Such a move would be unexpected, if it were not anticipated by the perspectivists of the thirteenth century, namely by John Peckham who is Borotín's direct source here. Extramission is introduced not as a single explanation of vision but in a way trying to make it compatible with intromission. In other words, Borotín (like Peckham) does not want to assert that extramission is the primary mechanism of vision, although it is somehow involved in a process which is generally intromissionist.\n\nBorotín implies two reasons why extramission may be appealing. Firstly, there is an ontological gap between crude material objects and the visual power which is,  after  all,  a  part  of  the  sensory  soul  and  thus  subtler  (albeit  not  as  completely immaterial as intellect). The species of the material object must therefore be refined and rendered proportionate to the visual power in order to be able to act upon it. This demand is met precisely by extramission - the power is emitted from the eyes (in the form of a cone) and makes the species proportionate to itself. The species are 'moderated' ( contemperantur ) and made suitable to enter the eye. If they were not moderated, sight would gradually be disintegrated by them (concl. 4, §36) 121 .\n\nSecondly, sometimes extramission of the 'natural light' of the eyes can substitute for external light when it is lacking. As commonly accepted, vision requires ordinary light - the color of objects cannot multiply their species without  being mingled with the light 122 . However, as some ancient anecdotes allege, some animals\n\n120 Compare §32 with Peckham, Perspectiva communis I, 45 (48), p. 128 (quoted in the edition).\n\n121 Borotín's source is Peckham, Perspectiva communis I,  46 (49), p. 128-130. Cf. also Rogerius Bacon, Perspectiva I.  7,  4,  p.  104-106  and  L.  Li/u010D.aka,  'The  Visual  Process:  Immediate  or  Successive? Approaches to the Extramission Postulate in 13th-Century Theories of Vision', in E. Baltuta (ed.), Medieval Perceptual Puzzles: Theories of Sense-Perception in the 13th and 14th Centuries , Leiden, Brill, 2020, p. 89-94.\n\n122 See, e.g., Peckham, Perspectiva communis I, 47 (50), p. 130.\n\ncan see in darkness. Borotín (again following Peckham) explains this precisely by advocating extramission: The visual powers of some animals are so strong that they can replace the outer light and give a 'power to multiply' ( virtus  multiplicativa ) even to color in darkness (§41) 123 .\n\nBorotín  therefore  combines  both  competing  positions.  The  primary  mechanism is intromission (the eyes receive species both  of  colors  and  light),  but  extramission is also involved in the process (the powers are emitted forth towards the objects in order to moderate and sometimes corroborate the species ). All three movements (the multiplication of species of colors and light, and the emission of powers) constitute three visual cones, with the apex in the eye and the base on the visible object - all occupying the same place (§37). Whereas perspectivists postulated only two cones (of species and of emitted power), Borotín adopts three cones from Bartholomaeus Anglicus.\n\nTo sum up, Borotín presents a compromise position. On the one hand, his answer to the question given to him by Hus is negative. In his view, sensations do not occur through extramission of the sensory power but rather by receiving the species of  the  object.  The  primary  mechanism  behind  vision  is  not  extramission but intromission. On the other hand, although he denies a robust conception of extramission, Borotín still argues for involving extramission (of visual power) in the visual process as important for 'refining' species coming from the outside to the eye. Is this an eclectic position, a superficial mixing of different sources without real understanding? It is worth noting that such a combination of intromission and extramission was quite common among medieval thinkers. Even Aristotle - although read as a strict intromissionist by thinkers like Albert the Great or Thomas Aquinas - was sometimes interpreted as conceding extramission 124 .  Stressing the extramissionist hints in Aristotle was common in the thirteenth century, especially among Franciscan thinkers (e.g. Bartholomaeus Anglicus, Bacon and Peckham). Not surprisingly, these authors also want to integrate extramission into their general account of perception. Thus, the compromise view presented by Borotín is derived directly from Peckham, but one may also find it in Bartholomew or Bacon 125 . The popularity of this position is also manifested by the fact that later in the fourteenth century it was held by John Wyclif who proposes it at least in his Trialogus 126 ,\n\n123 See also Peckham, Perspectiva communis I, 46 (49), p. 128-130.\n\n124 Especially some parts of his Meteorology (where he uses the notion of the visual ray to account for some meteorological phenomena), De animalibus (see §38 of Borotín's question), or De somno , where he  mentions  a  case  of  a  menstruating  woman  whose  gaze  allegedly  clouds  a  mirror  (2,  459b24460a23). The last passage (in Latin translation) is referred to in the excerpts from various texts on dreams written in Borotín's hand in his personal codex and interpreted as proposing extramission. See MS Prague, KMK, O 1, fol. 10r: '[…] facile hic videtur quod visus fiat extramittendo, ut per totum 3 m Metheororum videtur velle Aristoteles, ubi loquitur de refraccione visus.'\n\n125 Bartholomaeus Anglicus, DPR III. 17, p. 168, 169-170; Rogerius Bacon, Perspectiva I. 7, 2-4, p. 100-106.\n\n126 As mentioned in section II above, the evangelic doctor also ascribes this position to Augustine and Robert Grosseteste (Iohannes Wyclif, Trialogus II.  7,  p.  97);  see  also  Phillips,  'John  Wyclif ' , p. 258.\n\nwhich in turn inspired Hus in his preparation for discussion with Borotín. Thus, Borotín's conclusion was likely in consonance to what was regarded as the correct opinion among his peers during the quodlibetal session.\n\n## 4. Conclusions\n\nThis paper aimed to investigate the dissemination of perspectivist texts and knowledge of the discipline among Prague University masters around 1400. Despite the lack of optical manuscripts extant in Prague today, it has been documented that perspectiva was taught at the Prague Faculty of Arts at least from the 1370s and - on the examples of Jenek of Prague and Conrad of Soltau - that it was also referred to in philosophical and theological lectures. The main source for such investigation, however, is the Prague quodlibets organized from the 1390s to the 1410s. There are 13 questions explicitly dealing with optical topics included in the extant handbooks by Prague masters that organized a quodlibet . Some attest a considerable knowledge of perspectivist texts (Simon of Tišnov), while some are derived from other, more philosophical sources (namely from Wyclif, in the case of John Hus).\n\nThe only extant positio is the question on the mechanism of vision by John of Borotín. As it is a juvenile work by a fresh master of arts, expectations should not be too high. Borotín borrows extensively from De proprietatibus rerum by Bartholomaeus Anglicus in the notabilia section (on sensory powers and organs), but his position is influenced rather by John Peckham's textbook Perspectiva communis . He uses Peckham's arguments against extramission, but in the end proposes a compromise intromissionist account with some extramissionist features in a manner similar to Peckham. Nevertheless, Borotín's question is rather a cognate of Aristotelian psychological works than a full-fledged perspectivist text (e.g. Borotín includes nothing at all from geometrical optics) 127 .\n\n127 I am indebted to Ota Pavlíček and Pavel Blažek for discussions on the subject of this paper, and their valuable comments on the edition. My thanks also go to David Juste for sharing his copy of Borotín's codex with me, to Matyáš Havrda for his help in identifying the citations from Galen, and to Alena Hadravová for her hints on the dissemination of De proprietatibus rerum in Bohemia.\n\n## Appendix I Borotín's Notes in MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 18\n\nThe final redaction of Borotín's quaestio is preserved in MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 18 on fols 58r-61r among several different texts written in the same hand. All these texts constitute a part of the codex (55r-62v) which is - in terms of its handwriting - independent of adjacent parts. This part is also separated by blank folios (54 bis r - 54 ter v; 62 bis r - 62 bis v) 128 . As was argued above, this part of the codex may comprise folios Borotín himself used for recording notes, excerpts or preparing his own texts, and which were later bound together with other gatherings into one codex. A brief description of the contents of the passages written by what can be considered Borotín's hand follows:\n\n## 55r-56v: Notes on quaestiones on (human) intellect\n\nInc.: Sicud habet se sensus ad sensibilia, sic intellectus ad intelligibilia.\n\nNota: duplex est passio […]\n\nExpl.: […] ex 2  Metaphysice Buridani questione o .\n\nThis passage includes rather short quaestiones dealing with intellect. These notes or excerpts are of different lengths (some of them gather several arguments and notabilia, others a few sentences). The titles are: Utrum intellectus sit virtus passiva vel activa ; U. intellectus possibilis sit intelligibilis ; U. intellectus sit separatus ab intelligibili ; U. intellectus potest intelligere sine phantasmate ; U. calidum consumat ipsum humidum radicale (a mere title without text); U. indivisibile est intelligibile ; U. intellectus possibilis sit ens in pura potencia ; U. intellectiva anima sit forma substancialis .\n\nThe topics of all these questions belong to the tradition of commentaries on Aristotle's De anima III; the reference in the explicit indicates that they may be of a Buridanian origin. If written by Borotín himself, they may represent his reportationes of lectures on De anima or preparations for an exam.\n\nThe text seems to be written on a single independent bifolio.\n\n57r-57v: Shorter redaction of Borotín's Utrum sensationes […] - first part\n\nInc.: tur sic […]\n\nExpl.: […] et ista instrumenta iam … | in marg. inf.: motum, qui in prora, sensum.\n\nUtrum sensaciones fiunt per extramissionem virtutum ab organis sensitivis. ArguiQui ergo leditur in puppi amittit\n\n128 The composition of this part of the codex is not entirely clear at first sight, as the binding is very tight and the quires are mostly irregular. However, an inspection in situ revealed that fols 55-56 seem to represent an independent bifolio attached to a ternio (fols 57-62). All these folios are yellowed and timeworn, which contrasts with the brighter bifolio (54 ter + 62 bis) into which both the bifolio and ternio seem to be inserted. Such a quiring scheme (1+[1+1]+[3+3]+1) accords with the textual content of the gathering: while the bifolio includes Borotín's notes on De anima , the ternio preserves two versions of his quodlibetal positio .\n\nAs argued above, this part presents a preliminary, shorter but highly glossed version of Borotín's quaestio . It continues on fols 62r-62v. Note that fols 57 and 62 constitute a bifolio.\n\n## 58r-61r: Longer redaction of Borotín's Utrum sensationes […]\n\nInc.: Utrum sensaciones […].\n\nExpl.: […] questio, ut proponitur, est falsa.\n\nEdited below, see §§1-39.\n\n## 61r-v: Several notes connected to the main text of the quaestio\n\nInc.:\n\nVirtus, ut dicit Philosophus […]\n\nExpl.: […] qua sentiri debet sicuti est.\n\nEdited below, see §§40-43. Together with the preceding item, these texts are written on two bifolios (58-61).\n\n## 62r-62v: Shorter redaction of Borotín's Utrum sensationes […] - second part\n\nInc.: | … sunt sicud canalia que si obstruuntur per aliquam viscosum vel grossum humorem, cessat motus et sensus […]\n\nExpl.: Item ergo stantibus concurentibus sensu, organo eius, virtute, obiecto et medio et intencione actuali sensus super sensibile, causatur sensacio .\n\n## 62v: An excerpt on saliva from Bartholomaeus Anglicus\n\nInc.: Saliva in sapore est insipida […]\n\nExpl.: […] secundum qualitatem saporis rei gustate immutatur; hoc Constantinus .\n\nThis passage is not part of the preliminary version of the quaestio ; however, Borotín included it in the final one. See §25 in the edition.\n\n## Appendix II Critical Edition of John of Borotín's Quaestio utrum sensationes fiunt per extramissiones virtutum ab organis sensitivis\n\n## Ratio edendi\n\nThe question edited below is extant in a single manuscript (MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 18, fols 58r-61v). As argued above, the text preserved in the manuscript is written by the author himself in two versions. The aim of the present edition is more doctrinal than philological; thus, only the version the author considered final is edited here and the variants between both versions are not recorded. A full comparison of these two versions (merely indicated above) is beyond the scope of the present paper and may perhaps be the subject of future work on Borotín. Further, since the text is autograph, the additions, corrections and glosses, both marginal and interlinear (all of which are written in the same hand as the main text) are regarded as integral to the text itself and, consequently, are involved in the main edited text (the fact that they are later additions by the author is always indicated in the apparatus) 129 .\n\nI decided not to classicize the orthography, and the spelling of the manuscript is preserved even if it varies throughout the text (e.g. olofactus x ollofactus ). The only exception is a systematic distinction between the vowel letter u and the consonant v . Admittedly, this strategy of adhering to the manuscript's orthography does not free the editor from having to make a choice from time to time, especially when a medieval scribe's abbreviation enables different spellings. In such cases, I resort to the reading which is, to my best knowledge, more common in late medieval Bohemian manuscripts 130 .\n\nUpper-case letters are used in the edition to mark the beginning of a sentence, proper  names,  generic  names  used  in  reference  to  an  individual  person  ( Philosophus , Commentator ), or titles of texts. The titles are italicized. Abbreviations of the numerals are preserved (e.g. 3 o ). Roman numerals are not substituted by Arabic numerals and vice versa. The text is divided into sentences according to its meaning, the interpunction follows the logical order of the text rather than the punctuation in the manuscript, which is only occasional and often insufficient. The division into paragraphs preserves the original division in the manuscript\n\n129 I omit only the one-word glosses signaling the contents of the respective paragraph (e.g. the words vitalis and animalis on fol. 59r pointing to the parts of the text on the vital and animal power; see §16, and 17.)\n\n130 A special case is the Latin word for 'corollary' since medieval scribes used not only the correct variant corollarium , but also (and perhaps preferably) the incorrect variant correlarium . The present text includes seven instances of the abbreviation'cor m ',  which may be expanded in both ways (see §30 [twice], 31, 35 [twice], 37, and 39). However, §37 includes the derived adverb corollarie abbreviated as'cor'e ', which permits only the 'incorrect' reading e correlarie . Hence, I resort to the incorrect variant correlarium instead of the correct variant corollarium .\n\nonly partially: longer paragraphs are divided according to their sense. The paragraphs are numbered mainly to facilitate references. Quotation marks ('…') are used (i) to mark a piece of text that the author obviously intended as a quotation (usually, such a part of the text is preceded by an explicit reference to a particular author and/or his text); (ii) to indicate a tacit verbatim borrowing from another text by another author; and (iii) to mark an expression which is intended to refer to itself and not to its meaning (often preceded by ly in medieval Latin text). Square brackets ([…]) enclose words that I think should be deleted. Angle brackets ( &lt;…&gt; ) enclose words that I added, mainly headings and the numbers of the paragraphs. Editorial conjectures are indicated only in the apparatus by the abbreviation coni.\n\n## Conspectus auctoritatum\n\nAlbertus, Mineralia = Albertus Magnus, Mineralia . Opera omnia, vol.

Sicut enim cera recipit formam sigilli sine materia, sic sensus speciem sensibilis sine materia, ut vult  Philosophus 2 o De anima .  Species  autem  senciendi est similitudo materialis et propria rei, qua res materialiter cognosci habet sicuti est. Sunt autem sensus quidam interiores, quidam exteriores, sed dimissis interioribus, restringetur sermo pro exterioribus, de quibus magis videtur eodem questionis intencio.\n\n&lt;8&gt; Sunt autem sensus exteriores quinque - sensus visus, auditus, ollofactus, gustus et tactus - quibus fit sensacio, quarum eciam sunt organa quinque distincta secundum quinque corpora sensibilia principalissima mundi  corporei.  Primum  est  organum  visus  quod  est  quodammodo nature etheree ex eo quod est diafanum et lumen est sibi connatum, ut dicit auctor Perspective communis 46  proposicione primi: 'Lumen oculi a naturale radiositati sua conferre visui' . Sed quia organum visus faciliter recipit species et conservat, dicitur aquee nature.\n\n&lt;9&gt; Organum ollofactus est ignee, cum sit calidius et siccius. Auditus aeree: nam organum auditus mediante aere quodam in tortuositate auris complantato recipit species sui sensibilis et conservat. Organum gustus aquee, tactus autem terree. Omnis enim res corporea substancialis est nature alicuius illorum corporum. Similiter et organum. Dico igitur quod quilibet sensus habet suum organum, in quo suum exercet officium.\n\n&lt;10&gt; Organum visus est humor glacialis vel cristalinus, | ut dicit 36 a Communis  perspective :  'Visum  vigere  in  glaciali  humore' .

Que tunica si rumpitur, ita quod humor ille crystalinus effluit, visus corrumpitur, unde dicit Galienus I o De interioribus , quando quidam puer prefixit sibi humorem albugineum ita quod aliquot gutte eius eximit et tamen virtus visiva non fuit lesa, differens tamen est humor ille.

Organum gustus est quidam nervus a cerebro ad lingue medium ductus ad extremitates lingue ramificatus. Organum tactus est quidam nervus per totum corpus ramificatus et expansus sicud rethe. Et omnes isti nervi habent ortum de ventriculi cerebri a prora, i.e. anteriori parte cerebri.

The main claim that perspectiva was taught in Prague from the 1370s despite lack of manuscripts (A1) is supported by evidence from quodlibets (A2) and examples of different masters' knowledge (A3).\n\n2. The secondary claim about Borotín's work being more Aristotelian than perspectivist (A6) is supported by analysis of his sources (A4) and his theoretical position (A5).\n\nI focused on extracting the core argumentative claims and premises while avoiding peripheral details. The relations show how the premises support the two main claims being advanced.\n\nLet me know if you would like me to explain my rationale for any of these extractions or identify additional argumentative content from the text.",

    "system_prompt": "## GOAL\nArgument‑mine the following paper to extract its comprehensive argumentative structure.\n\n## DEFINITIONS\n1. **Argument**: A set of propositions, including some number of premises and a conclusion. The premises should logically entail the conclusion.\n2. **Claim**: A proposition that asserts something to be true or false, typically requiring justification or evidence.\n3. **Premise**: A proposition that provides evidence, justification, or logical support for a claim or conclusion.\n\n## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS\n1. **VERBATIM EXTRACTION ONLY**: Each ADU text must be copied EXACTLY from the paper with no modifications, paraphrasing, or combining of separate sentences.\n2. **NO HALLUCINATION**: Do not create, modify, or invent text that does not appear exactly in the source.\n3. **EXACT MATCHING**: Every word, punctuation mark, and spacing must match the original precisely.\n\n## DIRECTIONS\n1. **Identify Argumentative Discourse Units (ADUs)**  \n   - ADU = any contiguous text span functioning as a claim or a premise in the reasoning structure.\n   - **BE HIGHLY SELECTIVE**: Only include ADUs that are crucial to the overarching argument structure.\n   - Focus on significant claims and premises that contribute meaningfully to the argumentative flow.\n   - **AVOID NOISE**: Skip ADUs that are merely descriptive, tangential, or do not substantially advance the argument.\n   - Prioritize quality over quantity - fewer accurate, important ADUs are better than many insignificant ones.\n   - **EXTRACT ONLY**: Copy text spans exactly as they appear, without any modifications.\n2. **Classify each ADU**  \n   - Label = either `\"claim\"` or `\"premise\"`.  \n3. **Detect directed relations**  \n   - Relation = `\"support\"` or `\"attack\"`, from one ADU (source) to another (target).\n   - Map how ADUs connect to form reasoning chains.\n   - Focus on relationships between the most significant ADUs.\n   - Include relationships between premises that strengthen or weaken each other.\n4. **Verbatim spans**  \n   - Each `\"text\"` value must be copied EXACTLY from the paper with zero modifications.\n   - Do not paraphrase, summarize, or combine separate sentences.\n   - Do not add, remove, or change any words, punctuation, or spacing.\n   - If unsure about exact wording, skip that ADU rather than guess.\n\n## WHAT TO CAPTURE\n**INCLUDE ONLY:**\n- Main argumentative threads that are central to the paper's contribution\n- Core claims that represent the paper's primary arguments or findings\n- Key premises that provide essential support for major claims\n- Critical counterarguments and their refutations\n- Reasoning chains that demonstrate how main conclusions are derived\n\n**EXCLUDE (AVOID NOISE):**\n- Minor details, examples, or descriptive content that don't advance the argument\n- Tangential points or side discussions\n- Pure background information or literature review content\n- Methodological details unless they constitute argumentative claims\n- Obvious statements or commonly accepted facts\n- Redundant or repetitive argumentative content\n\n**GUIDING PRINCIPLE**: If removing an ADU would not significantly impact understanding of the paper's argumentative structure, it should be excluded.\n\n## QUALITY CONTROL\n- Before finalizing each ADU, verify the text exists exactly in the source\n- Prefer fewer, accurate ADUs over many potentially modified ones\n- When in doubt about exact wording, omit the ADU\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\nReturn **only** a single valid JSON object matching this schema.  \nDo **not** output any extra text, markdown, or explanations.\nDo **not** add comments.\n**RESPOND WITH ONLY**:\n```json\n{\n  \"ADUs\": {\n    \"<ADU_ID>\": {\n      \"text\": \"<exact span from paper>\",\n      \"label\": \"claim\" | \"premise\"\n    }\n    ...\n  },\n  \"relations\": [\n    {\n      \"source\": \"<ADU_ID>\",\n      \"target\": \"<ADU_ID>\",\n      \"type\": \"support\" | \"attack\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

At first sight, the prospects of such an endeavor appear rather dim. If the numbers of the manuscripts including optical texts extant in Prague libraries are considered, Prague seems anything but a center of optical studies. Nowadays, there are only two copies of Roger Bacon's Perspectiva (MS Prague, NK ČR, VIII E 27; MS Prague, NK ČR, VIII G 19) and three copies of John Peckham's textbook Perspectiva communis (MS Prague, KMK, L 29; MS Prague, KMK, L 41; MS Prague, NK ČR, adlig. 44 E 8), i.e. rather elementary renderings of optical science; while the scientifically more rigorous Alhacen, Witelo or Euclid are entirely lacking . The 1 si  tuation was probably no better in medieval times - according to the catalogs of the late medieval libraries of Prague University colleges, recently published by F. ŠmaThe 2018 Oxfam inequality report launched for the World Economic Forum in Davos (Switzerland) highlighted the sharp increase in inequality on a global scale over the last few years. According to this report, eighty-two per cent of the wealth generated in 2017 went to the richest one per cent of the global population, while the 3.7 billion people who make up the poorest half of the world saw no increase in their wealth. 1 In the same way, authors like Branko Milanovic have pointed out that we live in the most unequal era of history, and that this is a highly globalised and interconnected phenomenon which cannot be dealt with at the national level.  The effect of the 2 world wars and the crisis of the 1920s made it possible to reduce inequality and build a social model which, at least in the developed world, allowed for the emergence of a middle class and the so-called welfare state. This model was deeply shaken first by the conservative revolution of the 1980s and, more recently, by the global crisis of 2007-2008. All of this has in turn led to the emergence of national populism, as well as an alarming increase not only in economic and geographical inequalities, but in intergenerational ones as well. For the first time in decades, today young people in\n\n3\n\n* Work on this study received financial support from the Czech Science Foundation (GA ČR) project 'Philosophy at the University of Prague around 1409: Matěj of Knín's Quodlibet as a Crossroads of European Medieval Knowledge', grant n. 19-16793S, carried out at the Institute of Philosophy of the Czech Academy of Sciences.

Further, no commentary (or even 2 glosses) to any optical text of Prague origin has been discovered to date . 3\n\nThe small number of Prague optical manuscripts is particularly notable if manuscripts  from  the  same  period  kept  in  other  Central  European  university  centers (mainly Cracow and Vienna) are considered: there are eight extant copies of Peckham's Perspectiva communis from the fourteenth to fifteenth centuries in Cracow and seven copies in Vienna . Additionally, several commentaries on Peckham originated 4 at Cracow University , and Vienna University benefited from the presence of one of 5 the most famous late medieval commentators on perspectiva , Henry of Langenstein . 6\n\nIt may seem that there is nothing to investigate in Prague, that the extant   sources are too scarce to evaluate the role of optical science at the Prague Faculty of Arts. After  all,  this  is  the  honest  surrender  taken  by  Polish  science  historian  Grażyna Rosińska in her book on optics in the fifteenth century: she admits that in the absence of manuscripts, she was not able to investigate the optical tradition at Prague University, no matter how significant it might be . 7\n\n2 See Catalogi librorum vetustissimi Universitatis Pragensis / Die ältesten Bücherkataloge der Prager Universität , eds.

I, p. 573 and Lindberg, A Catalogue , p. 31). However, this codex was most likely written in Erfurt and the question itself was disputed there around 1350 by a disciple of Themo Judaei. See J. Pinborg, 'The 14th Century schools of Erfurt. Repertorium Erfordiense', in Cahiers de l'Institut du Moyen-Âge Grec et Latin , 41 (1982), p. 186. Although the copy of Sphaera materialis included in the same codex was used by the later owner of the codex, Petrus de Dwekaczowicz called Bibat, in his lectures on the same subject in 1448 and 1450 (see Truhl/u00E1.a/u0159.a, Catalogus , vol. I, p. 573), the perspectivist quaestio , as far as I know, had no significant influence on the Prague intellectual milieu. An edition of this quaestio is  under preparation by Jean Celeyrette, see J.

H. Steneck, Science and Creation in the Middle Ages: Henry of Langenstein (d. 1397) on Genesis , Notre Dame, University of Notre Dame Press, 1976, p. 9-22, for his tenets in optics and theory of light see p. 42-52.\n\n7 Rosi/u0144.aska, Optyka w XV wieku , p. 17-18.\n\nThe main aim of the present paper is to point out that efforts to investigate perspectiva in the context of late medieval Prague University are not so vain. As counting optical manuscripts kept in a local library is now neither the only nor the best way to judge the dissemination of perspectiva in this place in the later Middle Ages, I  suggest  other  ways  to  deal  with  the  issue  and  argue  that  there  are  other  types of sources to be considered. Therefore, section I inquires into studying optics at the Prague Faculty of Arts, highlighting both the faculty statutes and students' lists of the lectures actually attended. Also, it argues for a certain knowledge of optics among a considerable number of university members at least since the 1370s, by pointing to two lectures or commentaries (a philosophical one by Jenek of Prague and a theological one by Conrad of Soltau) whose authors assumed an acquaintance with perspectiva among their listeners. Section II draws attention to a type of source which - despite its arguable fruitfulness - has been under-investigated by historians of science: Prague quodlibetal disputations (1390s - 1410s), or the handbooks prepared by masters presiding over the quodlibets ( quodlibetarii ) and the elaborated positiones of the responding masters. Even a brief look at these texts reveals the acquaintance of the participants with optical auctoritates (e.g.  the  preparation of Simon of Tišnov [Šimon z Tišnova in Czech]). Finally, section III, the most extensive, represents the core of the paper and brings a thorough analysis of the question on the mechanism of vision ( Utrum sensationes fiunt per extramissiones virtutum ab organis sensitivis ) disputed by the Bohemian master John of Borotín (Iohannes de Borotin, 1378 - after 1458) in John Hus's quodlibet in 1411. The manuscript preservation of the question and its formal structure, as well as Borotín's sources and doctrinal position, are scrutinized. Borotín's question evinces that its author mastered John Peckham's textbook Perspectiva communis and adopted Peckham's view on the mechanism of vision, proposing a position intromissionist in general but also involving a kind of extramission. The paper also has two appendices - the first provides a description of part of MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 18 preserving Borotín's question, while Appendix II is a critical edition of the question.\n\n## 1. Studying Optics at the Prague Faculty of Arts\n\nFirst, it is worth premising what medieval optics is about. A marginal gloss in one of  the  Prague  manuscripts  of  Peckham's Perspectiva  communis introduces  a  brief definition of the discipline: 'Optics is a doctrinal science about light, colors and 'aspects' .' First, 8 perspectiva is called a 'doctrinal science' . In the Middle Ages, 'doctrinal sciences' are those abstracting away from the specific physical realization of the  object  under  consideration;  roughly,  mathematical  studies  -  besides  optics, arithmetic, geometry, or astronomy - are counted among them . They investigate 9\n\n8 Iohannes Peckham, Perspectiva communis , MS Prague, KMK, L 29, fol. 21r, in mg. sup. : 'Perspectiva est lucium, colorum et aspectuum doctrinalis sciencia.'\n\n9 See, e.g., Isidorus Hispalensis, Etymologiarum sive Originum libri XX , 2 vols, ed. W. M. Lindsay, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1911, III. Prol.; sometimes, the term 'scientia disciplinalis' is used; see Domini-\n\nsome features of nature (such as the propagation of light, its reflection or refraction in optics), but only insofar as they can be described using geometry. More Aristotelian classifications subsume optics (along with astronomy and harmonics) under the so-called 'middle sciences' ( scientiae mediae ) belonging both to mathematics and natural philosophy 10 .  Second,  the  gloss  determines  the  object  of  optics  -  it studies not only light and colors but also aspectus ,  i.e.  the  appearances  of  things (hence, some optical texts and the whole science are sometimes called 'de aspectibus'). In other words, medieval optics is not only a physics of the propagation of light but also an investigation of the physiological and even psychological processes behind visual acts. Hence, the scope of medieval perspectiva is considerably larger than that of present-day optics: whereas nowadays optics is a physical science about light and its properties, medieval optics is a conglomerate of physical, geometrical, physiological and even psychological inquiries 11 .\n\nThe blossoming of the perspectiva in Latin Europe came in the thirteenth century. Then, optics was one of the new sciences and was, as Roger Bacon says, both semi  nal for a knowledge of nature and neglected by his contemporaries 12 . Indeed, a full-fledged mastering of the optical science was scarce until the mid-thirteenth century. By that time, all of the important Greek and Arabic renderings of the discipline (i.e. works by Euclid, Ptolemy, Al-Kindi and especially Ibn al-Haytham, or Alhacen) had already been translated into Latin, and the discipline was assimilated and rendered into the context of Latin learning thanks to figures such as Roger Bacon, John Peckham and Witelo, who all authored textbooks or compendia of the optical science 13 .\n\nThereafter, perspectiva was  gradually  incorporated  into  the  curriculum  of philosophy studies at the studia of  some religious orders and faculties of arts 14 .\n\ncus Gundissalinus, De divisione philosophiae , ed. L. Baur, Münster, Aschendorff, 1903, prol., p. 15. The opposite of 'doctrinal' is a 'natural science' .\n\n10  See, e.g., Benedictus Hesse de Cracovia, Quaestiones disputatae super tres libros De anima Aristotelis (written in c. 1420s), MS Cracow, BJ, 2013, fols 8v-9r, cited by M. Markowski, Burydanizm w Polsce w okresie przedkopernikańskim , Wrocław, Ossolineum, 1971, p. 86: '[…] astronomia, perspectiva, musica […] aliqualiter participant de mathematica et aliqualiter de philosophia naturali, et ergo dicuntur sciencie medie inter mathematicam et philosophiam naturalem sicud […] perspectiva considerat de linea visuali, modo linea pertinet ad mathematicam sed visus ad naturalem.' For Hesse's sophisticated division of the sciences, see Markowski, Burydanizm w Polsce w okresie przedkopernikańskim , p. 53-56.\n\n11 See A. M. Smith, 'What is the History of Medieval Optics Really About?', in Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society , 148-2 (2004), p. 180-194, who argues that whereas modern optics is 'luminocentric', the pre-modern one was rather 'oculocentric' .\n\n12 Rogerius Bacon, 'Opus tertium', in Fr. Rogeri Bacon Opera quaedam hactenus inedita ,  vol. II, ed. J. S. Brewer, London, Longman, Green, Longman, and Roberts, 1859, p. 36-38.\n\n13 On the contributions of these three authors see D. C. Lindberg, Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler , Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1976, p. 107-121 or A. M. Smith, From Sight to Light: The Passage from Ancient to Modern Optics , Chicago / London, The University of Chicago Press, 2015, p. 260-277.\n\n14 Although it is neglected in this paper, the domain of perspectiva is not restricted only to the university milieu. As early as the late thirteenth century, perspectiva became a popular source for preachers. The moral dimensions of optical science are epitomized in the famous preaching manual De oculo morali by Peter of Limoges (written around 1280). This treatise was based on a careful study of Roger Bacon's Per-\n\nInterestingly, historians of science often mention that the earliest record in any university statutes to obligatory lectures on optics is, in fact, from Prague 15 . In the dean's book ( Liber decanorum ) of the Arts faculty, there is a statute enumerating which lectures a bachelor of arts must attend to be eligible for the master's exam. Lectures on Perspectiva communis (which is the most suitable for beginners of all the perspectivist texts) are included among other works from the fields of mathematics and astronomy 16 . This prescription is often dated 1390, like the entire Liber spectiva and original deduction of moral analogies and instructions from optical issues. On the place of De oculo morali in the perspectivist tradition see R. Newhauser, 'Inter Scientiam et Populum: Roger Bacon, Pierre de Limoges and the Tractatus moralis de oculo', in J. A. Aertsen, K. Emery, A. Speer (eds.), After the Condemnation of 1277.

Denery, Seeing and Being Seen in the Later Medieval World. Optics, Theology and Religious Life , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. 75-115.\n\nAlthough written at the University of Paris, it soon gained widespread dissemination outside universities and became a true medieval bestseller: there are more than 200 extant manuscripts of this text (Newhauser, 'Inter Scientiam et Populum', p. 688-689). It was obviously also read in the Bohemian lands. Even a quick look into the catalogs reveals a considerable number of copies of De oculo morali - e.g. in MSS Prague, NK ČR, I B 15; IV C 1; V C 10; VIII E 25; X B 24; XI C 8; XIV E 25; Prague, KMK, F 115; MSS Olomouc, Sbírka rukopisů Metropolitní kapituly u sv.

There is also a copy of Bohemian origin now kept in Uppsala (MS Uppsala, Universitetsbiblioteket, C 641) which, according to its explicit, was written in Prague in the 1370s (note that the scribe was uncertain about the authorship and ascribed it to Thomas Bradwardine): 'Explicit tractatus de oculo morali a doctore profundo magistro thoma Brabd bradbardeyn ut fertur finitus prage anno domini MCCC septuagesimo 4°.' (MS Uppsala, Universitetsbiblioteket, C 641, fol. 57r, cited by M. Andersson-Schmi/t\\_t.a, H. Hallberg, M. Hedlund, Mittelalterliche Handschriften der Universitätsbibliothek Uppsala. Katalog über die C-Sammlung , 6 vols, Stockholm, Almqvist &amp; Wiksell International, 1988-1993, vol. 6, p. 192, where the codex is also described.) It is highly probable that a future edition of Prague homiletical works will uncover at least some optical hints in the sermons, likely influenced by Peter of Limoges.\n\n- 15 See Lindberg, Theories of Vision , p. 121; Smith, From Sight to Light , p. 280-281.\n- 16 Statuta et Acta rectorum Universitatis Carolinae Pragensis 1360-1614 , ed. F. Šmahel, G. Silagi, Praha, Karo  linum, 2018, p. 243 (II. 27): 'Statutum fuit […] quod nullus magistrorum de facultate nostra, qui pro examinatore magistrandorum fuerit deputatus, aliquem ad tentamen admittat, nisi complete audiverit  libros  infra  scriptos,  videlicet  omnes  libros  Maioris  physice,  logicam  Aristotelis,  Ethicorum, Politicorum, Economicorum, sex libros Euclidis, [Iohannis de Sacrobosco] Spheram, [Campani Novariensis] Theoricam [planetarum], aliquid in musica et arismetica, Perspectivam communem [Iohannis de Peckham], De sensu et sensato, De somno et vigilia.' I split the phrase 'Spheram theoricam' into the two different astronomical works. See also Statuta et Acta rectorum Universitatis Carolinae Pragensis , p. 256 (V. 29), where it is stated that the lectures on Perspectiva communis should be conducted weekly for at least three months, but no longer than 14 weeks; and Statuta et Acta rectorum Universitatis Carolinae Pragensis , p. 260 (V. 40), where Perspectiva communis is listed among books that ought not to be taught on feast days.\n\nInterestingly, the Prague statutes are much more specific regarding mathematical (or quadrivial) disciplines than, e. g., the Parisian ones. A Parisian statute from 1366 includes only a general mention that a student striving for the license is required to attend lectures on 'some mathematical books' ( Chartularium Universitatis Parisiensis , 4 vols, eds. H. Denifle, A. Chatelain, Paris, Delalain, 1889-1897, vol. III, p. 145). In an older prescription, it is given more precisely that the bachelor should have attended 'at least a hundred lectures on maths' which means, e. g., 'one entire mathematical book, such as the treatise On sphere' completed and 'another book in progress' ( Chartularium , vol. II, p. 678).\n\ndecanorum ;  however,  what  is  called Liber  decanorum today  is  actually  a  'new' book created by then dean Matthias of Legnica, who also included older materials there 17 . As F. Šmahel points out, the statute article prescribing obligatory lectures on perspectiva is actually from the earliest stratum of the Liber decanorum, and its terminus ante quem is 1366 18 .\n\nHence, perspectiva might have been taught in Prague from at least the 1360s. Does a statute as a normative statement, though, entitle us to infer anything about actual practice? Obviously, further evidence is needed. A proof that attending optical  lectures was common practice among bachelors of arts can be gained from two lists of lectures attended by Prague students in the late 1380s 19 .  According to these, both students attended lectures on Peckham's Perspectiva communis delivered by Frederick of Drosendorf. The first student attended lectures on Perspectiva concurrently with lectures on Euclid and Theorica planetarum (all  three delivered by Drosendorf) 20 . The second student first heard lectures on the 2 nd and 3 rd books of Perspectiva communis (on  seeing by reflection and refraction, mirrors, lenses and some atmospheric phenomena), and only later lectures on the 1  book (on light, st anatomy and physiology of the visual organ, visual process and its condition and illusions) 21 .  Again, Drosendorf delivered all the lectures. However, since Drosendorf earned his master's degree in 1387 (and his performance at the exams was not particularly compelling), the quality and originality of his lectures on perspectiva delivered a year or two later is doubtful at best 22 .\n\nAnother testimony to Prague lectures on perspectiva is more than a decade older (and arguably the oldest one known today) - in a manuscript once kept in Halberstadt, a copy of Peckham's Perspectiva communis was accompanied by an explicit\n\n17 See Lindberg and Smith cited above (n. 15); on replacing the oldest book by Liber decanorum see F.

Possibly, the second student wanted to combine his classes thematically - he attended lectures on Aristotle's Meteorology concurrently with the lectures on Perspectiva communis II-III (at least partially) and on Aristotle's De sensu et sensato simultaneously with the lecture on Perspectiva communis I.\n\n22 See Šmahel, Die Prager Universität im Mittelalter , p. 325; for Drosendorf in Prague see also J. T/u0159.a/u00ED.a/u0161.aka, 'Příspěvky k středověké literární universitě I [Contributions to the Medieval Literary University I]', in Acta Universitatis Carolinae - Historia Universitatis Carolinae Pragensis , 9-1 (1968), p. 21. In the 1390s, we find Drosendorf in Vienna, studying medicine and teaching mathematical disciplines at the local university. He lectured on Perspectiva communis twice and on Proportiones breves , the abbreviation of Bradwardine's De proportionibus . See S. G/u00FC.anther, Geschichte des mathematischen Unterrichts im deutschen Mittelalter bis zum Jahre 1525 , Berlin, A. Hofmann &amp; Comp., 1887, p. 198-199. Later, he gained fame as the 'astrologer of Austria' and organized a disputation upon the appearance of the comet in 1402. He died in 1404. See M. H. Shank, 'Academic Consulting in Fifteenth-Century Vienna: The Case of Astrology', in E. Sylla, M.

The codex also included an optical treatise on the rainbow, but unfortunately, it is most likely lost today 24 .\n\nAnother, more indirect proof that Prague masters (and their students) were acquainted with optics in this early period are references to perspectivist texts made by them in lectures or commentaries on other works. The assumption here is that if a master refers to a perspectivist work or doctrine, he must know it, and it is also understandable to, and easily traceable and verifiable by, his listeners (as they have access to these texts in a library or have attended lectures on the issue). Two examples of such references can be introduced here - both texts are from the 1370s, to which the earliest evidence of optical lectures can be dated.\n\nThe first example is found in the commentary on De anima by Jenek of Prague (Jenco Wenceslai de Praga), usually dated 1375 25 . The references to optics are in the exposition of a passage in De anima II where Aristotle mentions kinds of objects which do not have any specific color in light, but which still appear luminous in darkness (he gives the examples of fungi or the scales or eyes of fish) 26 . This claim, however, seems to contradict the common Aristotelian conviction that what is seen is primarily the color and not the light. Commenting on this passage, Jenko first states that the issue pertains to the practitioners of perspectiva ( ad perspectivos pertinet ). He refers to Alhacen, whose explanation is that a more intense light somehow 'covers' the less intense one. A consequence is that a remote candle or stars are not visible in the daylight, but they are easily visible at night 27 .  Jenek  here evidently\n\n23  MS  Halberstadt,  Domgymnasium,  MS  217;  the  explicit,  cited  by  the  catalog  (G.  Schmidt,  'Die Handschriften  der  Gymnasial-Bibliothek  II',  in Königliches  Dom-Gymnasium  zu  Halberstadt.  Oster-Programm 1881 , Halberstadt, 1881, p. 20), is as follows: 'Finita est hec perspectiva communis magistri Johanis de Pysa anno Domini m.xxx.lxxiiij, in die s. Frederici imperatoris in honoranda universitate Pragensi, in domo medici imperatoris, per Allexium de Wratislavia, hora quinta decima.' This explicit has already been used by Šmahel, Die Prager Universität im Mittelalter , p. 107-108, 136 as proof that the lectures of the Prague Faculty of Medicine might initially have been delivered in the houses of royal doctors.\n\n24 The likely loss of the codex was suggested by Dr. Patrizia Carmassi (Herzog August Bibliothek, Wolfenbüttel) who was responsible for new cataloging of Halberstadt manuscripts, in an e-mail conversation from April 2017.\n\n25 On Jenek see P.

The date (or, at least, a terminus ante quem ) is based on the explicit of the commentary in MS Prague, NK ČR, VIII G 30, fol. 109r.\n\n26 Aristoteles, De anima II,  7,  419a1-7,  cf.  also  Averroes, Commentarium magnum in Aristotelis de ani  ma libros , ed. F. S. Crawford, Cambridge, MA, The Mediaeval Academy of America, 1953, II, 72, p. 239-240.\n\n27 Ienco Wenceslai de Praga, Commentarius in I-III libros De Anima Aristotelis , MS Prague, NK ČR, VIII G 30, fol. 70v: '[…] non omnes res sunt visibiles mediante aere illuminato […]. Quedam enim visibilia in lumine non videntur, sed in tenebra sub racione lucis, ut illa corpora que satis habent de igne in sua composicione, videntur in tenebris et sub racione qua lucent […] propter quam causam\n\nrefers to the second chapter of Alhacen's De aspectibus , book I, which is devoted to these kinds of situations 28 .\n\nAnother  example  may  be  found  in  a  theological  text  -  the  commentary  on Sentences by Conrad of Soltau, who lectured on Sentences in Prague around 1380 29 . Perspectivist influences are usually concentrated in one particular place in Sentences commentaries - the thirteenth distinction of book II, devoted to the issue of creation of light. Theologians had here an opportunity to show their proficiency in optics, dealing with such issues as the nature of light, its propagation, colors and so on 30 . In his rather brief treatment of the question, Soltau refers four times to optical science or directly to Peckham's Perspectiva communis (in one case, he even makes an exact reference to a specific proposition of Peckham's) 31 .\n\nHowever, does Soltau not borrow these references from another source? After all, his commentary is significantly influenced by the corresponding work of Thom-\n\nhec in tenebris sunt visibilia alia racio est, i.e. ad perspectivos pertinet, qui dicunt, quia sunt luminosa unde generaliter vel videntur tamquam proprium sensibile a visu nisi color et lumen, de die autem non videntur, quia lumen maius occultat multa visibilia que minus lucent, oportet per Alacen. Eciam lumen minus non videtur in lumine maiori secundum perspectivos. Est causa: sicud sonus maior ocultat minorem, sic lumen maius ocultat minus. Hec eciam est causa, quare candela de nocte accensa videtur a remotis et non de die et quare stelle apparent de nocte et non de die.'\n\n28 Cf. Alhacen, 'De aspectibus, I-III', ed. A. M. Smith, in A. M. Smith, Alhacen's Theory of Visual Perception , Philadelphia, American Philosophical Society, 2001, I. 2, §4. 8 and 4. 10, p. 5-6. A similar solution was also proposed in the Buridanian tradition of De anima commentaries. See (Pseudo-)Iohannes Buridanus, 'Expositio De anima', ed. B. Patar, in B. Patar, Le Traité de l'âme de Jean Buridan [De prima lectura]. Édition, étude critique et doctrinale , Louvain-la-Neuve / Longueil (Québec), Editions de l'Institut supérieur de philosophie / Editions du Préambule, 1991, II. 4, 1, p. 82-83 or Nicolaus Oresmius, 'Expositio in Aristotelis De anima', in B. Patar, Nicolai Oresme Expositio et quaestiones in Aristotelis De anima , Louvain / Paris, Éditions Peeters, 1995, II. 4, 1, p. 42-43; however, none of them mentions perspectiva in this passage, which renders the possibility that Jenek just borrowed the reference from another commentary unlikely. Note that Buridan's authorship of the exposition of De anima edited and ascribed to him by B. Patar has recently been seriously contested - see S. W. De Boer, P. J. J. Bakker, 'Is John Buridan the Author of the Anonymous Traité de l' âme Edited by Benoît Patar?', in Bulletin de philosophie médiévale , 53 (2011), p. 283-332. I therefore refer to the text as by pseudo -Buridan.\n\n- 29 On Conrad of Soltau see T/u0159.a/u00ED.a/u0161.aka, 'Příspěvky I' , p. 14; J.

On the one hand, Conrad evidently draws his inspiration from Thomas of Strasbourg in dividing the distinction into four articuli 33 ; he also shares Thomas's stance in all four cases (in one instance with an explicit reference to him) 34 .  Nevertheless, with one exception (different from Conrad), Thomas does not refer  to  optics  or  Peckham. Even if Conrad's rendering of the question was a mere abbreviation of the one by Thomas, then, Conrad's perspectivist hints would be his own 35 .  It may thus be concluded that writing his commentary  on Sentences ,  Conrad  of  Soltau  was  equipped  with  certain  optical knowledge and might count on the same among his listeners.\n\nTo summarize, the optical texts (chiefly Peckham, but perhaps also Alhacen) were known to Prague masters and students as early as in the 1370s - lectures on optics were delivered then, and the tenets of the discipline were referred to in both philosophical and theological texts.\n\n## 2. Discussing Optics in Prague Quodlibets (c. 1394-1417)\n\nAlthough acquaintance with perspectiva among the members of Prague University is already attested in the 1370s, there is substantially richer evidence of optical knowledge in Prague from the 1390s to the beginning of the Hussite Wars - namely, Prague quodlibetal disputations that took place at the Faculty of Arts 36 . As the questions on optics-related issues are rather numerous, this section is selective 37 . It  lists  the optical questions disputed in the quodlibets, briefly summarizes their topics, and focuses on how this kind of source can be utilized as evidence for the dissemination of perspectiva in the Prague University milieu (on the example of a question included in the quodlibet by Simon of Tišnov). As the rest of the paper is devoted to the question on vision disputed by John of Borotín in the 1411 quodlibet chaired by John Hus, Hus's preparation for the disputation with Borotín is briefly considered here, and its Wycliffian source is uncovered.\n\n32 Schabel, Brinzei, Maga, 'A Golden Age of Theology at Prague', p. 32.\n\n33 Compare Conrad's text with Thomas de Argentina, Commentaria in IV libros Sententiarum , Venice, Iordanus Ziletti, 1564, II. 13, fols 155rb-156va.\n\n34 Conradus de Soltau, Sent. II. 13, MS Prague, NK ČR, I D 23, fols 72vb-73ra: 'Quantum ad 2 m articulum dicit Tomas de Argentina quod non sunt eiusdem nature lumen vel lux corporum celestium et istorum inferiorum […].'\n\n35 E.g. Conrad's solution of the 4 th article is (contrary to that of Thomas) a mere statement that the issue is already solved in perspectiva .\n\n36 The fact that perspectiva remained an obligatory part of the university curriculum even after the secession of the German masters in 1409 is attested by a brief mention made by John Hus in his Quodlibet . Hus, introducing the young master Elias de Tyn (who had earned his master's degree in 1410), stresses that Elias had devoted himself to study of perspectiva recently. See Iohannes Hus, Quodlibet ,  ed. B. Ryba, Turnhout, Brepols, 2006, q. 52, p. 240-241: '[…] Magister E&lt;lias&gt; de T&lt;yn&gt; […] illi sciencie [scil.  perspective]  hoc  anno  specialiter  in  leccione  deditus,  scolas  nostras  in  hac  materia  clarissime informabit.'\n\n37 The author of this paper is preparing another study devoted precisely to the issue of perspectiva in Prague quodlibets.\n\nFirst,  it  is  worth  emphasizing  that  the  Prague  quodlibets  differ  substantially from the traditional ones in several aspects 38 . The traditional quodlibets (from the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries) were organized at theological faculties or the studia of different religious orders. A prominent theologian (deputized by his bachelor) had to answer whatever question was put by any member of the academic community, and then face counter-arguments to his solution. After this first part of the disputation, the master reorganized the questions according to similarities in their topics, summarized the discussions and stated his position on each of the questions (this elaborated version of his positions was called the determinatio ), and introduced it to the community several days later. After that, he sometimes refined his text into a final version intended for distribution ( ordinatio ) 39 . Thus, traditional quodlibets are often original and profound texts produced by the best scholars at the peak of their careers.\n\nBy contrast, the Prague quodlibets were instead a collaborative enterprise. The quodlibets we have evidence for were held at the Faculty of Arts .  The role of the master organizing the session was radically different: he did not answer the questions, but put them. The quodlibetarius had to prepare a question for each master of the faculty (often regarding the field of expertise of the latter) and then present counter-arguments against the latter's solution. Thus, the quodlibetarius prepared a handbook of these questions, including several counter-arguments against both positive and negative solutions to each question (as he did not know which of the options the responding master would choose, the quodlibetarius had to prepare for any of them). Since positiones of the responding masters are rather rarely extant, the actual handbooks of the quodlibetarii (or  rather copies of them) are the best source we have for the study of the Prague quodlibets. Obviously, in this case, we confront a specific kind of source. These preparations often do not include any con-\n\n38 For quodlibets (both as specific disputation sessions organized at medieval universities and studia and as a special kind of written sources) in general see J.

Moreover, the quodlibetarius might help himself by copying the preparation from another kind of source (see Hus below). However, when the preparation is not copied down word for word, it may still reveal what sources the quodlibetarius had at his disposal when he was preparing for the disputation (see Simon of Tišnov below).\n\nToday, no less than fourteen quodlibetarii from the period between 1394 and 1417 are known at least by name 40 .  Further, there are extant handbooks by seven of them: Henry of Ribenice (1394?), Matthias of Legnica (1399?), John Arsen of Langenfeld (1400?), Matthias of Knín (1409), John Hus (1411), Simon of Tišnov (1416) and Prokop of Kladruby (1417). Each of their handbooks is preserved in a single manuscript, and they have not yet been edited except for the handbook by Hus edited by Bohumil Ryba.\n\nWhen the lists of questions from of all of these quodlibets are examined 41 , no less than 13 questions relating explicitly to optics may be identified. All the quodlibetarii (except Arsen) included at least one perspectivist question in their handbooks:\n\n## Henry of Ribenice (MS Leipzig, Universitätsbibliothek, Ms 1414)\n\n- (1)  q. 48: Utrum radius visualis frangatur in occursu medii rarioris seu densioris\n\n## Matthias of Legnica (MS Stralsund, Stadtarchiv, Hs 1067, fols 207r-279r)\n\n- (2)  q. 85: Utrum visio facta sub pyramide radiosa fiat extra mittendo vel recipiendo\n\n## Matthias of Knín (MS Prague, KMK, L 45)\n\n- (3)  q. 37: Utrum species qualitatum per se sensibilium existat in medio realiter et subiective\n- (4) q. 72 (73): Utrum demonstrabile est iridem tantum tricolorem peripheriam circuli apparere\n- (5)  q. 114 (116): Utrum visio facta sub pyramide radiosa fiat intus suscipiendo vel extramittendo\n- (6)  q.  137  (140): Utrum multiplicatio luminis per medium uniforme sit uniformiter difformis\n\n40 The list of all known quodlibets, extant manuscripts and literature on each of them is in Šmahel, Die Prager Universität im Mittelalter , p. 377-381. Besides the quodlibets listed by Šmahel, I found what seems to be another Prague quodlibet in two Cracow manuscripts - in MS Cracow, BJ, 649 and (slightly abbreviated) in MS Cracow, BJ, 624 (which also preserves several abbreviated questions from Ribenice's quodlibet ). Arguably, both codices are of Prague origin, include a set of questions on various topics with problemata and a discussion on the quaestio principalis . Both codices can be dated to before 1400 on the basis of watermarks. They are described in M. Kowalczyk et al., Catalogus codicum manuscriptorum medii aevi latinorum qui in Bibliotheca Jagellonica Cracoviae asservantur , 9 vols, Wrocław, Ossolineum, 1980-2008, vol.

Two questions are dedicated to specific optical phenomena, namely the rainbow and mirror images (nos. 4 and 12). Whereas Knín prepared a question on whether there can be demonstrative science about the rainbow 42 , Prokop of Kladruby deals with the metaphysical nature of the images appearing in mirrors. Both gather arguments about the metaphysical nature of these phenomena: are they qualities existing in a full-fledged way, or mere appearances with somewhat diminished extramental existence?\n\nOther questions deal with human vision and the eyes (no. 7 and 10): Hus wanted to discuss the Aristotelian definition of vision; Tišnov prepared a fascinating question on the conditions of vision, apparently deeply influenced by perspectivist authors (see below). Finally, the mechanism of vision - i.e. whether an observer sees by intromission (receiving stimuli) or extramission (emitting something from\n\n42 Of all the questions listed above, Knín's seems to be the only one which has been studied by a modern scholar. See Koc/u00E1.anov/u00E1.a, 'The Sublunary Phaenomena' , p. 77-78.\n\nhis eyes) - figures prominently in four of these six handbooks (nos. 2, 5, 9, and 13.) The question disputed by Borotín is one of them.\n\nSome of these questions are Aristotelian both by their topic and the sources quoted in them 43 .  As for the perspectivist authors, the most quoted is, unsurprisingly, John Peckham; some quodlibetarii also refer to Alhacen. Nevertheless, in the context of tracing perspectivist influences, there is one interesting preparation with no counterpart in any known Prague quodlibet - that proposed by Simon of Tišnov (no. 10) 44 .\n\nThe question's title already reveals an apparent familiarity with perspectiva .  It asks whether there are eight conditions to be met for vision to be veridical - a standard issue in perspectivist literature 45 . When introducing these conditions, Simon of Tišnov even refers directly to Alhacen's De aspectibus and enumerates that for vision to be veridical, the object must be remote from and opposite the eyes, illuminated, and of a proper quantity and density, while the air must be transparent and the eye healthy, and a moment of time is needed 46 .\n\nFurthermore,  Tišnov's  preparation  includes  the  most  significant  number  of references to perspectivist texts of all the quodlibetal questions mentioned. I have counted 31 references in total; not only to the Peckham's textbook but also to texts known rather to specialists in optical science:\n\n| Peckham, Perspectiva communis   |   17 | Bacon, Perspectiva      |   2 |\n|---------------------------------|------|-------------------------|-----|\n| Alhacen, De aspectibus          |    8 | Euclid, De visu         |   1 |\n| Witelo, Perspectiva             |    2 | Al-Kindi, De aspectibus |   1 |\n\nReferences to Peckham 47 and Alhacen are direct - to a concrete proposition or chapter, which may indicate that Tišnov had these texts in front of his eyes. Two references to Bacon are interesting: the first is very vague (Bacon is just a name in a list of perspectivists) 48 , while the second comprises two pieces of text quoted by Tišnov and ascribed to 'someone writing about natural philosophy' ( quidam naturaliter\n\n43 As further research will probably reveal, some of them are derived from Aristotelian commentaries on, e.g., De sensu et sensato or Meteorologica .\n\n44 Simon de Tissnow, Quodlibet , MS Prague, Knihovna Národního muzea, V C 42, q. 46, fols 131v-133v.\n\n45 See Alhacen, De aspectibus III, 3, §3.1-3, p. 285; Rogerius Bacon, 'Perspectiva', in D. C. Lindberg (ed.), Roger Bacon and the Origins of Perspectiva in the Middle Ages , Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1996, I. 8-9, p. 108-144; Iohannes Peckham, 'Perspectiva communis', in D. C. Lindberg (ed.), John Pecham and the Science of Optics , Madison / Milwaukee / London, University of Wisconsin Press, 1970, I. 47 (50) - 54 (57), p. 130-134.\n\n46 Simon de Tissnow, Quodlibet ,  q.  46,  MS  Prague,  Knihovna  Národního  muzea,  V  C  42,  fol.  131v: 'Quod questio sit vera pro quesito, arguitur auctoritate Alhacen 3  libro sue o Perspective , capitulo 3 quod intitulatur 'capitulum de causis, quibus visui accidit decepcio', sic dicentis: quibus completur comprehensio visi, secundum quod est, sunt octo: remocio, opposicio, lux, quantitas, corporis densitas, dyafaneitas aeris, tempus, sanitas visus. Hiis ergo omnibus aggregatis visum comprehenditur vera visione.'\n\n47 Peckham is cited as 'Pisanus', which is a common mistake in late medieval manuscripts.\n\n48 Simon de Tissnow, Quodlibet , q. 46, MS Prague, Knihovna Národního muzea, V C 42, fol. 132r: '[…] maior patet ex primo Perspective Alhacen et Pisani et omnium Perspectivistarum, Bacon&lt;is&gt; et Vitellonis etc.'\n\nscribens ) 49 . Al-Kindi is quoted once as a proponent of an Aristotelian position unusual among the perspectivists - that light spreads out in an instant and hence what we see, we see immediately 50 .  As for the arguments, the preparation seems to be written by somebody well-versed in state-of-the-art perspectivist works 51 .\n\nDespite poor manuscript evidence, as stated in the introduction, some of the Prague quodlibetal questions - and primarily that by Simon of Tišnov - testify to not negligible degrees of knowledge of perspectiva 52 . Tišnov's question, though, - no matter how interesting - remains a preparation for discussion (and it is not even certain that it was really discussed during the quodlibetal session). As mentioned, the only optics-related question where both the preparation by the quodlibetarius and the positio by the responding master are extant is Borotín's question on the mechanism of vision proposed to him by John Hus. Since the rest of the paper is devoted to Borotín's positio ,  this section ends with a brief look at Hus's preparation for this question and its sources 53 .\n\nHus's preparation for the question of whether sensations are by sensory powers being emitted is rather brief and sketchy. Although several arguments both neganti and concedenti are gathered, all the arguments are ultimately for extramission. The first group of arguments is designed for a situation in which Borotín denies extramission ( neganti ) and defend a kind of syncretic account combining extramission with intromission. The second group is prepared for the case that Borotín accepts intromission ( concedenti, quod fit intus suscipiendo ) - and is thus against intromission, defending extramission again. Obviously, Hus counted on Borotín's acceptance of the much more common intromissionist view 54 .\n\nAs Hus's preparation is strongly derivative, it is interesting to trace his sources. Although one expects a commentary on De sensu or a perspectivist work as a chief\n\n49 Simon de Tissnow, Quodlibet , q. 46, MS Prague, Knihovna Národního muzea, V C 42, fol. 132v: 'In oppositum arguitur et primo contra supposita et primo, quia questio supponit quod oculus componitur ex quattuor tunicis. Contra hoc arguitur sic: non est compositus oculus ex quattuor tunicis, igitur illud primum suppositum questionis est falsum. […] Hoc idem patet auctoritate cuiusdam naturaliter scribentis circa materiam de oculis, questione 2é capitulo 2 , sic dicentis: 'Oculus autem habet tres o tunicas seu panniculos et tres humores et unam telam ad modum tele aranee [= Bacon, Perspectiva I, 2, 2, p. 26] . ' Et in eodem capitulo circa finem dicit: ' Aliqui eciam VII tunicas posuerunt, sed falsum est, quia telam araneam pro tunica computaverunt [= Bacon, Perspectiva I. 2, 2, p. 28]. ''\n\n50 On the context of the medieval debate see D. C. Lindberg, 'Medieval Latin Theories of the Speed of Light', in R. Taton (ed.), Roemer et la vitesse de la lumière , Paris, Vrin, 1978, p. 45-72.\n\n51 The profundity and originality of this preparation are also surprising, as Tišnov's quodlibet is traditionally supposed to be heavily influenced by earlier quodlibetal handbooks. Cf. Kej/u0159.a, Kvodlibetní disputace , p. 97-101; Šmahel, Die Prager Universität im Mittelalter , p. 369 counts 15 questions copied from Knín's quodlibet by Tišnov.\n\n52 Besides optics-oriented questions, references to perspectivist authorities also appear in other questions on different topics. For example, Zdeněk of Labouň (Zdenko de Labun) in the question debated in Hus's quodlibet explains some optical phenomena such as the rainbow or halo as a result of refraction of sunlight in the atmosphere and refers several times to the Perspectiva by Witelo, i.e. to a highly technical compendium of optics. Unlike Tišnov's vague reference to Witelo, Labouň refers to specific propositions, which may indicate that he has the text before his eyes. See Zdenko de Labun, 'Questio astronomicalis', ed. B. Koc/u00E1.anov/u00E1.a, in ead., 'Questio astronomicalis Zdeňka z Labouně: Kritická edice [Questio astronomicalis by Zdeněk of Labouň: A Critical Edition]', in Listy filologické , 139 (2016), §3.7, p. 158-159.\n\n53 The preparation is edited in Iohannes Hus, Quodlibet , q. 56, p. 254-256.\n\n54 As will be scrutinized below, Borotín accepted a syncretic account in the end.\n\nsource for such a question, Hus is faithful to his favorite thinker John Wyclif even here and borrows a considerable portion of the text from Wyclif's theological masterpiece Trialogus , namely from a chapter on sensation in the first anthropological part of the work 55 . On the other hand, it is not so surprising if one takes into consideration both Wyclif's intense interest in the science of perspectiva 56 and the popularity of Wyclif's works among reformist Bohemian masters (concentrated around John Hus and Jerome of Prague) 57 .\n\nThus, even the title of Hus's question prepared for Borotín is borrowed from Wyclif:\n\n| Iohannes Hus, Quodlibet , q. 56 58                                                                                                                                                                                           | Iohannes Wyclif, Trialogus , II, 7 59                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| […] Hanc autem difficultatem […] Magister Io<hannes> de B<orotin> […] nostro auditorio declarabit.

Istam materiam nec tractas philosophice neque fundas, imo difficultas utrum autem sen- sationes fiunt per extramissiones virtutum ab organis , cum aliis difficultatibus, praetermittis […]. |\n\nIn the neganti section,  Hus  then utilizes Wyclif's chapter on sensation, where the evangelical doctor defends a middle position between intromission and extramission. Hus's first argument (inspired by the second part of Wyclif's text) asserts that vision itself is on the intersection of an extension of the (imaginary) visual ray and cathetus , i.e., a line drawn through the object perpendicular to the surface of the mirror (The perspectivist dictum used here pertains to the issue of the location of the mirror images; unlike Wyclif, Hus mentions the context of mirror perception only at the very end of the argument). As the intersection is (usually) behind the mirror and hence outside the eyes, Hus's concludes that vision must be by extramission 60 .\n\n55 Iohannes Wyclif, Trialogus, cum Supplemento Trialogi ,  ed. G. Lechler, Oxford, Clarendon, 1869, II. 7,  p.  97-98.  Note  that  although  Hus's  dependence  on Trialogus in  q.  56  is  unnoticed  by  editor B. Ryba, he identifies several borrowings from Wyclif's Opus evangelicum in q. 52 (on the multiplication of light). See Iohannes Hus, Quodlibet , q. 52, p. 240-246.\n\n56 Copious evidence is provided by H. Phillips, 'John Wyclif and the Optics of the Eucharist', in A. Hudson, M. Wilks (eds.), From Ockham to Wyclif , Oxford / New York, Basil Blackwell, 1987, p. 245-258.\n\n57 On the dissemination of Wyclif's works in Bohemia in the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries and his influence on Prague University masters see V. Herold, Pražská univerzita a Wyclif [Prague University and Wyclif], Praha, Univerzita Karlova, 1985; Šmahel, Die Prager Universität im Mittelalter , p. 467-489 (chapter on 'Wyclif's Fortune in Hussite Bohemia'); or O.

Van Dussen (eds.), Europe after Wyclif , New York, Fordham University Press, 2017, p. 89-114. According to his own testimony, Wyclif's Trialogus was copied in Oxford and brought back to Bohemia by Jerome of Prague himself. See Pavl/u00ED.a/u010D.aek, 'Wyclif 's Early Reception' , p. 94. F. Šmahel, Verzeichnis der Quellen zum Prager Universalienstreit 1348-1500 , Wrocław, Ossolineum, 1980, p. 16-17 lists five copies of Wyclif's Trialogus of Bohemian origin; all of them are today in Vienna (MSS Vienna, ÖNB, Cod. 1387; 3930; 3932; 4505; 4516). There is also evidence - although questionable - that Trialogus was translated into Czech by John Hus himself. See F. M. Barto/u0161.a, Literární činnost M. J.

The second is apparently borrowed from Knín, who, in turn, renders an argument presented by Albert the Great.

Incidentally, the doxographical part of Hus's question was incorporated (almost word for word) into a later Prague question on the mechanism of vision (see Anonymus, Utrum visio fit intus suscipiendo et non extra mittendo , MS Prague, NK ČR, V H 13, fol. 236r).\n\n67 Iohannes Hus, Quodlibet , q. 56, p. 256.\n\n68 Ma/t\\_t.ahias de Knin, Quodlibet , MS Prague, KMK, L 45, q. 114 (116), fol. 123r.\n\n69 Alexander, Albertus, Avicenna ] coni.

Even the present sketch, however, reveals that perspectivist issues were quite popular in the quodlibets, and that in their preparations the quodlibetarii utilized not only almost all the important perspectivist texts (Simon  of  Tišnov),  but  also  unexpected  theological  and  philosophical  sources popular among Bohemian masters (Wyclif used by Hus). Finally, the quodlibetarii also apparently exploited quodlibetal preparations by their former colleagues (as Hus's use of Knín suggests).\n\n## 3. John of Borotín's Quaestio on the Mechanism of Vision\n\nAs already noted, the main problem one must face investigating the presence of optical issues in the Prague quodlibets is the specific nature of the extant written sources - almost all the optical questions are preserved only in the form of preparations gathered in the handbooks by quodlibetarii before the disputations themselves.  This  kind  of  source  cannot  reveal  what  the  discussion  was  like,  or  which position the responding master held. There is however one exception - a positio (elaborated response to the question in written form) by the Czech master John of Borotín, who disputed a question on the mechanism of vision in the quodlibet by John Hus in 1411. The rest of this paper is devoted to Borotín, and to analysis of his question, which is also edited below (see Appendix II).\n\n## 3.1 Borotín's Life and Works\n\nJohn of Borotín was born in 1378, studied the arts at Prague University, and earned his bachelor's degree there in 1400 and master's in 1410. He then lectured and held several positions at the university for almost half of a century until his death (after 1458) 74 . As a fresh master of arts, he had still been attending university lectures in\n\n73 qualitas ] coni. quans cod.\n\n74 Borotín was dispensator (1414 and 1416), dean of the Faculty of Arts (1415 and again 1432), examiner of bachelors (1417 and again 1450) and rector of the whole university (1425-1426). Initially, he was also rector of  a  minor school in Zderaz (in 1412). On his life and service to the university see J. T/u0159.a/u00ED.a/u0161.aka, Literární činnost předhusitské university [Literary Work of the Pre-Hussite University], Praha, Universita Karlova, 1967, p. 166, 173; K. Ber/u00E1.anek, 'O počátcích pražské lékařské fakulty 1348-1622 [On the\n\nthe 1410s. This part of his career is well documented because he wrote down a series of lectures that he attended in his personal codex (today MS Prague, KMK, O 1), which is also useful for identifying Borotín's hand 75 . Evidently, he had a special interest in the astronomical disciplines. From the lecture reports and several dated first-person glosses it can be surmised that he attended a number of introductory lectures on astronomy in 1411: MS Prague, KMK, O 1 preserves an introductory text on De utilitatibus astrolabii by Christian of Prachatice (Křišťan z Prachatic in Czech, fols 37r-37v), an introduction to astronomy with a division of astronomical and astrological disciplines (38r-39r) and commentaries on Sphaera materialis (39v-45v) and Theorica planetarum (46r-47v, 49r-65r) 76 . Borotín then attended lectures on Thabit ibn Qurra's introduction to Ptolemy's Almagest (in 1412, fols 126r-129r) given by John Šindel (Iohannes Andreae Schindel), and Šindel's lectures on the Almagest itself  (in  1413,  fols  138r-161v) 77 ,  as  well  as  lectures on Alcabitius (in 1413, fols 72r-89v) and Alfraganus's De differentiis (in 1414, fols 181v-222r). Marginal glosses and introductory notes written in Borotín's hand indicate that he used these reportationes and excerpts several decades later when he was lecturing these texts 78 .\n\nBeginnings of the Prague Faculty of Medicine]', in Acta Universitatis Carolinae - Historia Universitatis Carolinae Pragensis , 9-2 (1968), p. 79; Šmahel, Die Prager Universität im Mittelalter , p. 146, 303-306; and esp.

Spunar, Repertorium , vol. I, p. 141-142 and Burne/t\\_t.a, 'T eaching'; also C. H. Lohr, 'Medieval Latin Aristotle Commentaries Authors: Jacobus - Johannes Juff', in Traditio , 26 (1970), p. 158. The following passage includes several precisions and additions to Borotín's bibliography.\n\n75 On  the  contents  of  the  codex,  see  Patera,  Podlaha, Soupis  rukopisů , vol. II, p. 452-453; A.

David Juste is preparing a new description of the codex. The codex is in large part Borotín's autograph, as recently argued by Burne/t\\_t.a, 'Teaching', esp. p. 11-13 (the main arguments are the notes in the first person, some of them including Borotín's name). Borotín's hand is idiosyncratic - wide, very cursive and not easy to read.\n\n- 76 Traditionally, it was surmised that the text on fols 37r-65r is a copy of a text on the astrolabe (perhaps by Christian), because of a gloss on fol. 37r ('Principium in tractatum C[ristiani] De utilitatibus astrolabii 1411 […].') and a gloss on fol. 66r following this part of the codex ('1452 incepi legere Alkabicium fer&lt;ia&gt; tertia ante Ascensionem Domini ego M. Io&lt;hannes de&gt; Bo&lt;rotin&gt;'), where 'Alkabicium' was read as 'Astrolabium' . See Patera, Podlaha, Soupis rukopisů ,  vol.  II,  p.  452;  Burne/t\\_t.a, 'T eaching' , p. 13-14 also seems to incline to it. This surmise was refuted by Hadravov/u00E1.a, Hadrava, Křišťan z Prachatic , p. 77-78; who prepared editions of both Compositio astrolabii and Usus astrolabii by Christian (see Hadravov/u00E1.a, Hadrava, Křišťan z Prachatic , p. 133-171, 201-281). A closer look at these passages reveals that the text is actually a series of different commentaries, as stated above.\n\n77 On these texts, see D. Juste, 'Johannes Andree Schindel, Lectures on Thebit Bencora's De hiis que indigent expositione antequam legatur Almagesti ' (update: 30.03.2017), Ptolemaeus Arabus et Latinus. Works , accessible from: https://ptolemaeus.badw.de/work/120, and D. Juste, 'Johannes Andree Schindel, Lectures on the Almagest ' (update: 21.03.2017), Ptolemaeus Arabus et Latinus. Work s, accessible from: https://ptolemaeus.badw.de/work/77. On Schindel (1370s - between 1455 and 1458), the famous Bohemian astronomer and probable designer of the Prague astronomical clock, see, e.g., Spunar, Repertorium , vol. I, p. 133-140 and the study by Alena Hadravová and Petr Hadrava in this volume.\n\n78 This was pointed out by Burne/t\\_t.a, 'Teaching', for Borotín's lectures on Alcabitius.\n\nIn the 1410s, Borotín also participated as one of the responding masters in three quodlibetal  disputations.  He  responded  to  a  question  on  extramission  and  the mechanism of vision in John Hus's quodlibet in  1411 79 ,  a  question on mathematical disciplines and their principles in a quodlibet organized by Michael of Malenice called Čížek in 1412 80 ,  and  a  question on the generation of stones and metals in Prokop of Kladruby's quodlibet in 1417 81 .\n\nLater, during his long career as a teacher, Borotín lectured on several books of natural philosophy, astronomy and medicine. Some of his commentaries are preserved - either as his own preparations for lectures or as marginal glosses in copies of the texts he lectured on, written down as reportationes by his students. In the 1420s he lectured on medical texts - on Hippocrates's Aphorisms (1424, Borotín's brief introduction is preserved in MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 23, fol. 49r) and Isagoge Iohanitii (1430, glosses in MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 16, fols 15r-20r) and later, on Aristotle's Meteorology (1433, glosses in MS Prague, NK ČR, VII E 9, fols 107r-174v) 82 . In the final part of his life, he focused mainly on astronomy and astrology, giving lectures on Ptolemy's Quadripartitum (1444, glosses in MS Cracow, BJ, 593) 83 , Campanus of Novara's Theorica planetarum (1449, introductory notes in MS Prague, KMK, O 1, fols 129v-130r), Alfraganus's De differentiis (1450) 84 and on Alcabitius's Introduction to Astrology (in 1452 and 1454) 85 . Besides that, there are two undated commentaries written in Borotín's hand - a continuation of an exposition on the Alfonsine tables (MS Prague, KMK, O 1, fols 114r-115v) and a commentary on Euclid's Elements (MS\n\n79 Utrum sensationes fiunt per extramissiones virtutum ab organis sensitivis , preserved in MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 18, fols 58r-61r and analyzed and edited below.\n\n80 Utrum omne principium mathematicae, cuius obiectum primarium est quantitas, sit necessarium , preserved also in MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 18, fols 94v-101v.\n\n81 Utrum lapides et metalla generari in nubibus sit possibile quemadmodum in visceribus terre -  Borotín's position is not extant, there is only the quodlibetarius Prokop's preparation in MS Prague, KMK, L 27, fols 40v-41r (on which see also Koc/u00E1.anov/u00E1.a, 'The Sublunary Phaenomena', p. 94-95).\n\n82 There is also a note in MS Prague, KMK, O 1, fol. 222v (basically several paragraphs on the issue of why some regions are uninhabitable), the title of which suggests Borotín lectured on Meteorology as early as 1420: '1420 circa leccionem Metheororum M&lt;agistri&gt; J&lt;ohannis de&gt; B&lt;orotin&gt;.'\n\n83 The codex is described by M. Kowalczyk et al., Catalogus ,  vol.  IV ,  p.  144-148  and  D.  Juste, 'MS Cracow, Biblioteka Jagiellońska, 593' (update: 25.02.2017), Ptolemaeus Arabus et Latinus. Manuscripts , accessible from: https://ptolemaeus.badw.de/ms/182.\n\n84 There is testimony that Borotín lectured on Alfraganus in a list of university lectures preserved in the rear endpaper in MS Prague, KMK, L 43 (and transcribed in Tříška, Literární činnost ,  p.  173): 'Item Iohannes Borotin eodem anno [=1450] legit Alfraganum De differentiis; incepit f. III  ante Zophie.' No a commentary is extant; however, Borotín might have based his teaching on the lectures he attended in 1414 and wrote down in MS Prague, KMK, O 1.\n\n85 Borotín started to lecture on Alcabitius in 1452 (see MS Prague, KMK, O 1, fol. 66r) but apparently changed his mind - see MS Prague, KMK, O 1, fol. 66r: 'Et dicenda minori&lt;bu&gt;s sunt minora verba divi - dicamus igitur aliquid minori pro intelligendo isto libro […]. Et quia iste liber subservit astronomie, cum sit introductorius in iudicia astrorum, aliquid igitur pro noticia astronomie hic dicemus ante omnia et post hoc incipiemus istum librum dei auxilio.' He then lectured on Alcabitius again in 1454. See his preamble in O.1, fols 130r-v (edited by Burne/t\\_t.a, 'Teaching', p. 26-27), where he mentions that he had lectured on the book before but stopped (Burne/t\\_t.a, 'Teaching', p. 26, §3). The preamble ends with a cross-reference to fol. 72r, where the commentary written in 1413 starts, indicating that Borotín lectured on Alcabitius in 1454 according to his student notes from 1413.\n\nPrague, KMK, O 1, fols 165r-178r; with a long borrowing from Alan of Lille's Anticlaudianus III on geometry in the introduction). There are also mentions of Borotín's lectures on plague ( de pestilentia ) and of him as an expert on computus 86 .\n\nBorotín was evidently engaged in the quadrivium or mathematical disciplines in the broad sense, mainly in astronomy. However, does perspectiva have a special place in his thinking? It does not seem so. E.g. in the commentary glosses to Meteorology ascribed to him, the glosses to book III (a traditional place for investigating optical phenomena, such as the rainbow) are rare and short, and serve merely as explanations of difficult expressions 87 . Although he presented several methodological remarks about perspectiva in the question on mathematical principles disputed in Čížek's quodlibet 88 , the most evident influence of the optical tradition is to be found in his earliest text, the question on the mechanism of vision disputed in Hus's quodlibet .\n\n## 3.2 Utrum sensationes : Two Versions of the Text\n\nThe final redaction of Borotín's question Utrum sensationes (preserved in Prague, NK ČR, X H 18 and edited below in Appendix II) 89 consists of a brief propositio (§1-3) with basic arguments pro and contra and problema , a section including notabilia where Borotín investigates all the terms included in the title of the question (§5-28), and finally a section with conclusions and corollaries where Borotín's stance  is  presented  (§29-39).  The  text  itself  does  not  contain  any  information concerning its authorship. Nevertheless, the title of the question matches the one included in John Hus's handbook, and the propositio section is copied from Hus's preparation verbatim . Moreover, since Hus ascribes the question to John of Borotín and calls him 'a new Avicenna,' referring to Borotín's skills in medicine and optics 90 , there is no doubt that the author of the position in MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 18 is John of Borotín.\n\nThe text as preserved in MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 18 has a slightly more complicated structure. In the first place, the part of the codex under discussion includes two versions of Borotín's question. The first redaction is shorter and sketchier, con-\n\n86 See Spunar, Repertorium , vol. I, p. 42.\n\n87 See  Iohannes  de  Borot/u00ED.an, Epitome  Meteorologicorum  Aristotelis ,  MS  Prague,  NK  ČR,  VII  E  9, fols 152v-161r (book III) and especially tractatus 2 on fols 154r-161r which is 'de passionibus causatis ex refraccione radiorum solis aut lune' (fol. 152v, in mg.). Glosses explain terms for optical atmospheric phenomena such as the halo, parhelia etc. On fol. 157r a gloss points out that Aristotle speaks about vision as if it were by extramission ('Perloquitur de visu quod sit extramittendo.' See also note 124 below.). Several diagrams are included, e.g. the origin of the halo (155v), the colors of rainbow (158r) and its origin (159r, 159v, 160r).\n\n88 Here,  Borotín  explains  in  what  sense perspectiva is  subordinated  to  geometry.  See  Iohannes  de Borot/u00ED.an, Utrum omne principium , MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 18, fol. 97v.\n\n89 For reference, I use the paragraph numbers of the edition.\n\n90 Iohannes Hus, Quodlibet , q. 56, p. 255: 'Hanc autem difficultatem venerandus Magister noster, Magister Io&lt;hannes&gt; de B&lt;orotin&gt;, cum sit preclarus perspectivus et medicus, velud Avicenna alius, nostro auditorio declarabit.'; Iohannes Hus, Quodlibet , p. 281: 'Illic Iohannes Borotyn, ut Avicenna, sensaciones, qualiter fiunt intus suscipiendo et extramittendo, cum ceteris difficultatibus conpendiosissime declarabat.'\n\ntaining many crossed phrases, interlinear and marginal glosses, and consisting only of notabilia . It is written on a single bifolio; however, due to binding, the text is on the folios both before and after the second version (fols 57r-57v, 62r-62v) 91 .  The second version seems complete, as it includes not only notabilia but also conclusions and corollaries. There are also fewer cross-outs and glosses. After the text of the second version, there are several notes in the manuscript. As they relate to the main text (as argued below), I involve them in the edition (§40-43). The hand of the scribe is very cursive and, importantly, is the same for all the texts mentioned.\n\nThere are several indications which suggest that the exemplar of Borotín's question preserved in MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 18 is an autograph. The first (albeit not particularly persuasive) indication is that the hand of the scribe of Utrum sensationes is very similar to Borotín's handwriting preserved in MS Prague, KMK, O 1. Secondly,  another  question Utrum  omne  principium  mathematicae , disputed  by Borotín in the following year, is preserved in the same codex and shares both the idiosyncratic hand and complicated structure typical of Utrum sensationes . It also includes the beginning of the question, with propositio and first notabile (Prague, NK ČR, X H 18, fol. 94v) and then another version of the beginning with an additional division (95r). Further, there are notabilia , conclusions and corollaries (95r-99v); and the final version of the question is again followed by what can be considered preparatory notes that mirror the structure of the question itself (100r-101v). It is possible that two quires with Borotín's personal writings were bound (with many other disputed questions) into this collected volume.\n\nThe most persuasive reason for declaring Utrum sensationes an autograph, however, is a comparison of the two versions of the question. This comparison suggests that the scribe had worked extensively on the text, adding new parts and rearranging the old ones, refining the style, etc. Sometimes, too, a marginal gloss in the first version is extended and becomes a part of the main text in the second. All of this suggests that the scribe is identical to the author. The comparison reveals that the first version functions as preparatory notes for the second version, which is in turn carefully constructed as a final version of the text.\n\nSometimes Borotín changes the preparatory text because he finds a more suitable authority. For example, defining the term virtus (the soul's capacity to perform an action, e.g. a cognitive one), the preparatory version refers to Aristotle's definition of virtus as a habit that perfects and renders good both its bearer and his deeds, and identifies virtus with spiritus ,  understood physiologically with Avicenna as a 'subtle vapour' (fol. 57v). These are not, however, particularly convenient definitions when the virtus in dispute is a power of soul as Aristotle's definition relates rather to a moral or intellectual virtue, whereas Avicenna is talking about the physiological vehicle which is behind the workings of the power. Borotín was aware of this unsuitability, and in the final version, he proposes an entirely different definition which he borrowed from Bartholomaeus Anglicus: power is an essential attri-\n\n91 For a more detailed description of this part of MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 18 and more information about the gatherings see Appendix I.\n\nbute of the soul by means of which the soul performs its actions in the body (§14). Nevertheless, Borotín still found Aristotle's definition worth mentioning, and thus he put it after the final version of the question as an additional remark (§40), where he applies Aristotle's definition of virtue to the case of the soul's power, stressing that sensory power renders the workings of body perfect and good.\n\n| Preparatory notes fol. 57v                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Final version fol. 58v = §14                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Additional note fol. 61r = §40                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Dixi 3 o quod ad sensacionem re- quiritur virtus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Dixi 3 o quod ad sensacionem re- quiritur virtus que est causa effi- ciens sensacionis, ut dicit Con- stantinus in Pantegni .                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Unde virtus 92 - licet apud phi- losophos multipliciter accipitur, tamen pro presenti materia                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Unde ly 'virtus' apud philoso- phos multipliciter accipitur; in presenti tamen materia summitur virtus pro quadam po- tencia anime per quam ipsa suas operaciones exercet in corpore et describendum sic:                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| potest sic describi: 'virtus naturalis 93 est habitus 94 , que habentem se perficit et opus eius bonum reddit, 95 ' ut dicit Philosophus Ethicorum ; vel po- test dici spiritus, qui - ut dicit Avicenna I o Canonis , fen I a - est vapor subtilis ex sanguine reso- lutus ad totum corpus multipli- catus 96 . | 'Virtus est potencia anime ei essencialiter attributa ad suas peragendas in corpore acciones, nam mediante hac virtute anima corpus vivificat, cor et arterias constringit continue et dilatat, sensum et motum voluntarium omni animato corpori admini- strat, ut dicit idem Constantinus libro 13 in Pantegni 97 .

The definitions of virtutes (see below) in Borotín's preparatory notes, for example, are rather brief (fol. 57v), while the same passage in the final version is detailed and consists above all of borrowings from Bartholomaeus (see §15-21). It seems that Borotín discovered the usefulness of Bartholomaeus's encyclopedia for his purposes after he had already written the major part of his preparatory notes. Tacit borrowings from Bartholomaeus, although numerous in the final version, are completely absent from the preparatory notes. Sometimes it seems that Borotín realized he could improve his text with a quotation from Bartholomaeus while finalizing it. For ex-\n\n92 virtus ] sic describitur add. sed del.\n\n93 naturalis ] suprascr.\n\n94 habitus ] suprascr.\n\n95 Aristoteles, Ethica Nicomachea II, 5, 1106a15-24.\n\n96 Possibly Avicenna, Liber canonis , Basel, Johannes Herwagen, 1556, I. 1, 6, 4, fols 49-50.\n\n97 Bartholomaeus Anglicus, De proprietatibus rerum , vol. I: Prohemium, Libri I-IV, eds. B. Van den Abeele, H. Meyer, M. W. Twomey, B. Roling, R. J. Long, Turhnout, Brepols, 2007 [hereafter abbreviated as DPR I-IV], III. 14, p. 162.\n\nample, he excerpted a short passage on saliva and its role in the sense of taste from Bartholomaeus and placed it after the whole text of the preparatory notes (fol. 62v). Then, writing the final version and discussing the object of taste, he notes that what is perceptible to the sense of taste must be humid and adds a quotation from Aristotle's De anima . He might, however, have recollected the excerpt on saliva, crossed out Aristotle's saying, added these several lines on saliva from Bartholomaeus and, finally, added Aristotle's dictum again after that (see §25).\n\nThe claim that the scribe of the text may be the author himself is further confirmed by notes appended to the final version of the text (§40-43). At least some of these seem to be an outcome of a rereading and rethinking of the final version carried out by the author himself. The corollary to the first conclusion (§30), for example, states that the sensible per se does not bring about the sensation. To give precision to this statement, he later adds what 'per se' means here: he superscribed 'secundum esse reale', making clear that the statement pertains only to the sensible in its real being. Nevertheless, the distinction between the real and intentional being of the sensible, no matter how common in the medieval philosophical literature, had not previously been introduced in the text. He therefore adds a marginal gloss 'hic nota' to this place, which is most likely a cross-reference to one of the notes after the text (see §43). Here, on fol. 61v, the marginal 'hic' appears again next to the text that begins 'nota […]', and explains the distinction between esse reale and esse intentionale .\n\nIn the corollary to the fourth conclusion (§37), Borotín introduces the notion of the visual cone. He says that there is both a cone constituted by species multiplied from the sensible object and a cone constituted by species of the eye emitted from the eye (on the doctrine, see below). At the end of the corollary, however, Borotín speaks about three cones. This seeming mistake can be explained if one has Bartholomaeus's text in mind. In his discussion of vision, Bartholomaeus introduced the third cone. Besides the two cones from the object and the eye, there is a further cone of light. Borotín also had this passage on the necessity of light for vision in mind, which is proven by the fact that he includes it among the notes after the question (see §42).\n\nThese examples reveal that the question Utrum sensationes , as preserved in MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 18, is a genuine work-in-progress, its two versions representing two stages of the text formation, as the former includes many notes which in the latter were carefully elaborated, edited and refined by a scribe who, in all probability, is to be identified with the author himself.\n\n## 3.3 Utrum sensationes : Borotín's Sources\n\nAt first sight, Borotín's question appears to be quite revealing regarding its sources. There are numerous explicit references, mainly to Aristotle (10×), Constantine the African and his Pantegni (8×), and Peckham (or 'auctor Perspective communis '  -6×). It is however unclear to what extent, or even whether, Borotín worked with the actual texts of these authors (at least in the case of Aristotle and Constantine). Tracing Borotín's references reveals a considerable discrepancy between who is explicitly referred to, and from whom the passage is borrowed (see the table below). When the actual borrowings are considered, Borotín's most prominent source is -\n\nperhaps surprisingly - Bartholomaeus Anglicus and his encyclopedia De proprietatibus rerum (especially book III on human psychology) 98 .  Although almost never indicated,  there  are  no  less  than  twenty-three  borrowings  from  Bartholomaeus, some of them quite extensive 99 .\n\nSometimes Borotín uses Bartholomaues as a source for other authors' positions. It is highly probable that Borotín did not work with Constantine's Pantegni , Calcidius's commentary to Plato's Timaeus , or Aristotle's De animalibus . Although he names these works several times, in all cases either the reference to them is a part of a literal borrowing from Bartholomaeus (hence, it seems as if he quoted from these authors themselves - see, e.g., §14, 15, 20, 38) 100 ,  or Borotín deliberately ascribes quotations from Bartholomaeus to another, perhaps more eminent authority (especially to Constantine, as in §19, 25, or 27) 101 .\n\nNevertheless, it is very likely that Borotín had copies of two other sources before his eyes - Peckham's optical textbook Perspectiva communis and Galen's compendium De locis affectis (referred to by him as De interioribus ). In the case of Peckham, Borotín refers to specific propositions using correct numbering, and often quotes them literally (see §8, 10, 36, 41); sometimes he also accepts and rephrases Peckham's doctrine (see §32). The three quotations of Galen's De interioribus are less accurate, but at least one of them is still traceable (see §18) 102 .\n\n98  Bartholomaeus's encyclopedia (finished about 1240 in Saxony) was apparently popular in the Bohemian Lands. H. Meyer, Die  Enzyklopädie  des  Bartholomäus  Anglicus:  Untersuchungen  zur  Überlieferungs-  und  Rezeptionsgeschichte  von  'De  Proprietatibus  Rerum' , München, Wilhelm Fink Verlag, 2000, lists six codices which preserve an original Latin version (p. 99-101) and two other redactions or compilations (p. 171, 177) now kept in Prague libraries, all from the fourteenth or fifteenth century and most of them of Czech origin. Two copies of Bartholomaeus are also mentioned in late medieval catalogs of Prague University libraries. See Catalogi librorum vetustissimi Universitatis Pragensis , p. 127 (N I: Q48, Q49). Later in the fifteenth century, Paul Žídek used Bartholomaeus for his own encyclopedia. See A. Hadravov/u00E1.a, Kniha dvacatera umění mistra Pavla Žídka: část přírodovědná [Master Paul Žídek's Book of Twenty Arts. The Natural Sciences Part], Praha, Academia, 2008, p. 47-48.\n\n99 There is one unwitting reference to Bartholomaeus's text in §21 of Borotín's quaestio .  Borotín,  introducing three kinds of bodily spirit, compiles this paragraph out of excerpts from chapter III, 22 of Bartholomaeus's encyclopedia. Having tacitly borrowed Bartholomaeus's claim that the spirit is generated in the liver,  Borotín  avoids  summarizing  Bartholomaeus's  scrupulous  exposition  of  the propagation of spiritus through other organs by reference (where 'post presentem' means 'after the just quoted passage from Bartholomaeus') to his source: 'Quaere post presentem de generacione huius spiritus.'\n\n100\n\nHence, Borotín's reference to Calcidius in §20 cannot unfortunately be used as further evidence for the dissemination and popularity of his commentary to Plato's Timaeus among Bohemian masters around 1400. On Platonist influences on Prague University masters see, e.g., E. Jeauneau, 'Plato apud Bohemos', in Mediaeval Studies , 41 (1979), p. 161-214, esp. p. 162-168; Herold, Pražská univerzita a Wyclif , p. 230-231; or Pavl/u00ED.a/u010D.aek, 'Wyclif 's Early Reception' , who listed numerous borrowings in the works by Borotín's contemporary Jerome of Prague (p. 100, 113).\n\n101 Such a practice might have been common among Bohemian scholars. Use of Bartholomaeus's encyclopedia is proven in the Czech lexicographer Claret (Bartholomaeus de Solencia in Latin, Bartoloměj z Chlumce in Czech) a half-century before Borotín. See, e.g., A. Vidmanov/u00E1.a, 'Mistr Klaret a jeho spisy [Master Claret and His Writings]', in Listy filologické , 103-4 (1980), p. 221.\n\n102 Borotín probably used a copy of Galen when working on his preparatory notes, whereas he prepared the final version without further reference to it. When discussing the faculty of movement ( virtus\n\n| Source                                                 | Explicit references   | Actual borrowings (as identified in the edition below)   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Bartholomaeus Anglicus, De proprietatibus rerum        | -                     | 23                                                       |\n| Aristotle (various works)                              | 10                    | 8                                                        |\n| Peckham, Perspectiva communis                          | 6                     | 6                                                        |\n| Averroes (various works)                               | 2                     | 3                                                        |\n| Galenus, De interioribus                               | 3                     | 3 (?)                                                    |\n| Constantinus Africanus ( Pantegni or unspecified work) | 8                     | 1 (?)                                                    |\n| Calcidius, Super Timaeum                               | 1                     | -                                                        |\n\nSometimes Borotín uses  terminology  or  phrases  from  Buridanian De  anima commentaries; this terminology, however, was so common that it is impossible to trace his exact sources (see, e.g., §27, 35). Further, he introduces an argument very similar to one proposed by John of Jandun in his De sensu commentary (see §35 and the respective note). Borotín might have had access to Jandun's works 103 , although Jandun's argument might also have become a part of later tradition and Borotín could have encounter it in another work. Also, the definition of sensation that Borotín incidentally added in the margin at the beginning of the notabilia section may be borrowed from 10 th -century Jewish philosopher Isaac Israeli (see §7).\n\nFinally,  there  is  no  link  between  the  quodlibetal  preparation  by  Hus  and Borotín's positio except the fact that the propositio of Hus's preparation and Borotín's question (in both preliminary and final versions) are identical 104 . Borotín, however, neither addresses any of Hus's arguments nor makes any indication that he was acquainted with Hus's preparation for disputation. The explanation suggesting itself is that Borotín received the propositio before the quodlibetal disputation, prepared a written determination of the question which he then presented during the ses-\n\n103\n\nmotiva ), Borotín mentions Galen's example of a patient hit in his spine, whose three fingers lost the capability to move while they remained able to feel (see §18). Nevertheless, Galen described precisely the opposite case: the patient lost the sense in his fingers, but could move them (Galenus, 'De interioribus', in Quarta impressio ornatissima continens omnes Galeni libros , ed. Rusticus Placentinus, Pavia, De Burgofranco, 1515, I. 6, vol. II, fol. 27rb: '[…] dixit sensum digitorum a triginta diebus esse ablatum, motus vero digitorum permansit […].'). Interestingly, Borotín rephrased Galen correctly in the preparatory notes (see fol. 62r: '[…] narrat Galenus I o De interioribus de quodam homine, qui amiserat sensum in tribus digitis, motum tamen non amisit.') but adjusted this example in the final version. Borotín's acquaintance with the so-called 'new Galen' may be considered a further proof of his connection to the Faculty of Medicine, which is sometimes suggested but founded only on indirect evidence. See Ber/u00E1.anek, 'O počátcích', p. 79; Šmahel, Die Prager Universität im Mittelalter , p. 146. The  notes  on De  anima written  in  Borotín's  hand  preceding  the quaestio encompass  a  variant  of andun's theory of two substantial forms of the human being, namely, cogitative and intellective soul. J Compare MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 18, fol. 56v with Iohannes de Ianduno, Super libros Aristotelis de Anima subtilissimae quaestiones ,  Venice, Hieronymus Scotus, 1552, fol. 71ra. On Borotín's notes on the human intellect, see Appendix I. Jandun's commentary on De anima is also mentioned in the catalogs of Prague University libraries; see Catalogi librorum vetustissimi Universitatis Pragensis , p. 40 (shelfmark R II: G27), p. 139 (shelfmark N II: D18).\n\n104 Compare §1-3 in the edition (and the beginning of Borotín's preparatory notes in MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 18, fol. 57r) with Hus's preparation in Hus, Quodlibet , q. 56, p. 255.\n\nsion. His question as preserved in MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 18 originated before the session itself, as it does not seem to reflect either Hus's preparation or the discussion that probably followed Borotín's performance 105 .  Further, it is also uncertain whether Borotín read his positio in its entirety during the session, as it is quite long (and a little tedious in its notabilia section) and 54 masters were responding to a question in Hus's quodlibet that lasted only a couple of days 106 .  Hus noted at the end of his handbook that Borotín responded very concisely ( conpendiosissime ) 107 .\n\nNevertheless, another interpretation is possible. Borotín might have presented his preliminary version of the text, which includes merely the notabilia ;  in  other words, he might just have explained the meanings of all the words employed in the title of the question. Only after the discussion with Hus, might he have prepared the final version of the question intended for distribution, where he takes the syncretic position connecting intromissionist and extramissionist accounts of perception, paying homage not only to Peckham but also to Wyclif, the source of Hus's preparation. The issue of the exact shape of the Prague quodlibetal disputations remains undecided 108 .\n\n## 3.4 Borotín's Position in the Dispute over the Mechanism of Vision\n\nOnce textual issues and Borotín's sources have been investigated, the doctrinal aspects of the question can be scrutinized. The question asks 'whether sensations occur by the [sensory] powers being emitted out of the sensitive organs' ( Utrum sensationes fiunt per extramissiones virtutum ab organis sensitivis ) and is thus devoted to the issue of what the mechanism of vision is. This issue arose even in Ancient philosophy and science, and was still popular in the Latin Middle Ages. As pre-modern optics concerned not only the physics of light but also the physiology and psychology of seeing, it became one of the crucial questions investigated in optical science. The history of pre-modern optics is often narrated as a clash between two competing answers to this issue, i.e. intromission and extramission. Some authors (such as Democritus or Aristotle) proposed an intromissionist explanation of the visual mechanism as they claimed that we see by receiving an entity in our sight. For Aristotle, for example, such an entity is a causal effect of the quality (color) of the external object ( eidos or species ) that first actualizes the medium between the object and the observer, and then the observer's power of sight. Other authors (such as Plato, Euclid or Galen) favoured the extramissionist explanation of vision: our sight must issue forth or emit an entity in order to see. Such an entity is a visual\n\n105 In his pivotal book on Prague quodlibets, Jiří Kejř argues that such was a common practice. According to Liber decanorum ,  the quodlibetarius had to deliver the topic of the question to every responding master three or four days before the session (see Kej/u0159.a, Kvodlibetní disputace , p. 28); extant positiones of various masters reflect neither the actual discussion (Kej/u0159.a, Kvodlibetní disputace , p. 62-63) nor the quodlibetarius ' s preparation (except in just one case, see Kej/u0159.a, Kvodlibetní disputace , p. 67-68).\n\n106 Kej/u0159.a, Kvodlibetní disputace , p. 92.\n\n107 See quotation in note 90.\n\n108 I thank Ota Pavlíček, who prepares an up-to-date study on the processual aspect of Prague quodlibetal disputations, for his insights into the matter.\n\nray of fire or light nature for Platonists or Euclidians; for Galenists, it is a visual spirit or pneuma 109 .\n\nSometimes historians argue that the dispute was settled as early as in the eleventh century by the Muslim scientist Alhacen, who united all the traditions and elaborated  a  powerful  explanatory  optical  paradigm  based  on  intromission  and denying extramission 110 . Nevertheless, some Latin perspectivists of the thirteenth century (esp. Roger Bacon and John Peckham), although heavily influenced by Alhacen and proposing intromission, still made room for extramission 111 .  The question of intromission and extramission had therefore not been answered once and for all for Latin medieval scholars. It has the status of a problema (an unsettled issue where both positions are equally attractive), and was thus ideal for quodlibetal disputations - and as pointed out above, a question on extramission vs intromission was included in almost every Prague quodlibet .\n\nResponding  to  the  question  given  to  him  by  Hus,  Borotín  chooses  what  is called by his contemporary Zdeněk of Labouň the 'ancient way' ( modus antiquus ), i.e. to first define all of the terms included in the title of the question (rather than to divide the response into a series of articles, which is the modus modernus ) 112 . In terms of word count, this notabilia section is the longest as it occupies c. 58/u0025.o of the text (whereas the section with conclusions occupies only c. 26/u0025.o and the additional notes only 14/u0025.o). Further, Borotín is sometimes verbose in the notabilia . He seems to forget that the question is restricted only to the visual power and adds more information about faculty psychology in general, or organs and media of all the senses, which eventually turns the notabilia section into a general introduction to the theory of the sensitive soul and its operations.\n\nIn the notabilia section, there is a palpable tension between Aristotelian influence and the more Platonizing tendencies delivered by Bartholomaeus Anglicus (whose encyclopedia predates the broad dissemination of Aristotle's psychology after c. 1240s and hence still bears the seal of the twelfth-century Platonic- and Galenic-oriented philosophy) 113 .  Sometimes, Borotín tries to assume a compromise position; sometimes he sides with Bartholomew. For example, Borotín follows Aristotle's lead when he defines what sensory perception ( sensatio ) amounts to be. The sensation is a kind of apprehension realized when a species (i.e. a similitude) of the object is impressed on a sense (§5). The species is a sensible accidental form of the object (e.g. color); however, it is abstracted from the material realization that it has when inhering in the object. In this frame, Borotín also introduces the famous Aristotelian analogy with wax and\n\n109 For the dispute among Ancient thinkers, see Lindberg, Theories of Vision , p. 1-17 and Smith, From Sight to Light , p. 23-75.\n\n110 E.g. Lindberg, Theories of Vision , p. 58-86, esp. 85-86.\n\n111 See Lindberg, Theories of Vision , p. 107-121 or Smith, From Sight to Light , p. 256-273.\n\n112 Zdenko de Labun, Questio astronomicalis ,  §3, p. 135 : '[…] respondeatur secundum modum antiquum, videlicet simpliciter declarando ea, que ponuntur in titulo questionis, sine hoc, quod questio ipsa in multos articulos distingwatur, qui est modus modernus.'\n\n113 R. J. Long, the editor of book III of DPR , stresses the influence of the pseudo-Augustinian work De spiritu et anima and also medical tradition, esp. Constantine the African. See Bartholomaeus, DPR , p. 139-142.\n\nseal (§7). He does not, though, seem to agree with more Aristotelian-minded thinkers in reducing the sensation to a passive reception of species (although he mentions this Aristotelian position in §7). Influenced by Bartholomew, he acknowledges the more Platonic view that the efficient cause of the sensory act is the sensory soul (or its power) itself (§12, 14) 114 . An apparent conflict between these two views is resolved by distinguishing between (principal) efficient causality and an instrumental one. The sensation is apprehension effectuated by both the species (as the instrumental cause) and the sensory power (as the efficient cause) (§5).\n\nAnother example is the issue of the nature of eye, concerning which there was a debate between Aristotelians and Platonists. On the one hand, Aristotelians proposing intromission stressed the ability of the eye-jelly to receive impressions, inferred that it must be easily malleable and concluded that eyes are of a watery nature 115 . On the other hand, Platonists surmised that eyes are of an igneous nature and that their inner light or spirit may emit forth. A fiery nature is also ascribed to the eyes by Bartholomaeus Anglicus 116 . Borotín admits that - insofar as its ability to receive impressions is considered - the eye may be called watery, but its proper nature is different. Borotín wants to assign one element to each of the senses - and as the organ of hearing is airy, that of taste is watery, that of smell is fiery, and that of touch is dominated by the element earth (§9), the element which remains for vision is the aether 117 . Borotín's statement is not to be pushed too far (and read as an ascription of a special celestial nature to the eyes); he simply wants to emphasize that the eyes have a sort of natural light which participates somehow (see below) in the visual process. He supports this claim by reference to Peckham's Perspectiva communis (§8) 118 . Later in the additional notes (§41), Borotín repeats that eyes are of an aetherous nature and compares them to celestial bodies. Just as some stars are warmer and have stronger rays while others have only diminished light, so various animals have visual powers of different strengths. Borotín concludes that some animals have eyes with more natural light than humans, and are able to emit stronger visual rays, which is supported by popular extramissionist anecdotes (also mentioned by Peckham) - cats or wolves allegedly see in darkness, and the lynx is even able to see through walls 119 .\n\n114 See esp. Bartholomaeus, DPR III, 17, p. 167 (for vision); 18, p. 172 (hearing); 19, p. 174 (smell); 20, p. 176 (taste); 21, p. 178 (touch). The ascription of a causal role to the soul's power is typical of  the  Platonic  and  Galenic  tradition.  See,  e.g.,  William  of  Conches, Glosae  super  Platonem , ed. E. A. Jeauneau, Turnhout, Brepols, 2006, II, 148, p. 267 or Constantinus Africanus, 'Pantegni', in Ysaac, Omnia opera , 2 vols, Lyon, 1515, vol. II, fols 1ra-144ra, here Theorica IV. 10, fol. 17ra.\n\n115 See Aristoteles, De sensu 2 where he criticizes his predecessors and states his position.\n\n116 Bartholomaeus, DPR III, 17, p. 167: 'Sensus igitur visus, cum sit igneus, est simplicissimus […].'\n\n117 Such a matching of elements and sensory organs has a long tradition in pre-modern philosophy. See, e.g.,  Augustinus, De Genesi ad litteram libri duodecim ,  ed.  J.  Zycha,  Prag  /  Wien  /  Leipzig, F. Tempsky, 1894, III. 4, p. 66-67 who, however, assigns a fiery nature to sight. Aether was regarded as a special fifth element of a very subtle, fiery and crystalline nature, located above normal air and a constituent of celestial spheres.\n\n118 Peckham, Perspectiva communis I, 46 (49), p. 128-130. However, Peckham does not explicitly assign an aetherous nature to the eyes; he seems to accept the Aristotelian position about their watery nature. Cf. Peckham, Perspectiva communis I, 31 (34), p. 112.\n\n119 Cf. Peckham, Perspectiva communis I, 46 (49), p. 128-130; 51 (54), p. 132.\n\nAnother example from the notabilia section of Borotín siding with medical authors rather than Aristotelians is his classification of the soul's powers ( virtutes ). While the fundamental division for Aristotelians is into vegetative, sensory and rational faculties, Borotín introduces a Galenic division which can be found in Constantinus, and which he borrows from Bartholomaeus Anglicus. There are three basic  powers  (§14-20):  (1)  natural  power  ( virtus  naturalis ),  responsible  for  the vegetative functions of the body; (2) vital power ( virtus vitalis ) which brings life to  the  individual body; and animal power ( virtus  animalis ),  responsible for cognitive functions and locomotion. All of these powers are embodied. Natural power originates from the liver, vital power has its seat in the heart and is diffused by the arteries throughout the body, and animal power is seated in the brain. Borotín also borrows the medical notion of spiritus (§21) which is a subtle matter diffused through the body which, in Platonic thinking, plays the role of mediator between the immaterial soul and material body. There are three kinds of spiritus corresponding to the three powers (natural, vital and animal).\n\nIn a brief but important remark closing his exposition of powers and spiritus (§21), Borotín qualifies the meaning of the term 'extramission' included in the title of the question. In his view, what is emitted is not a body of a luminous or fiery nature (e.g. a ray of inner light, as Platonists would maintain), but precisely these powers, namely, the sensitive  ones.  As  will  become  obvious  in  the  conclusions, such  a  qualification  enables  Borotín  to  hold  a  compromise  position  between intromission and extramission.\n\nThe influences of the three sources quoted most frequently by Borotín - Bartholomew's encyclopedia, Aristotle, and Peckham's Perspectiva communis - are not present equally in all the sections. As pointed out, Bartholomew's domain is the notabilia section, whereas Aristotle's and Peckham's influences are more evident in the section with conclusions. Responding to the central issue of the text - whether vision is  by  extramission  -  Borotín  continues to balance between opposing authorities.\n\nInitially, he proposes a version of an Aristotelian intromissionist account of vision. He begins with an evident intuition that every sensation is in its proper sensory organ (conclusion 1, §29) and not outside of it, as the extramissionists seem to imply. This intuition is corroborated not only by Aristotle's authority in De sensu but also by reasoning: if the efficient cause of the sensory act is the sensory power - and Borotín (under Bartholomew's influence) agrees with this - then since the power is in the organ, its effect is in the same place.\n\nHowever, the sensible object itself is  not present and efficacious in the sensory organ as seeing a green color, the eye does not actually become green. Borotín states this in the corollary (§30), and solves the problem by the Aristotelian distinction between the real and intentional being of the sensible (he adds the proper expression of the distinction as an additional note after the text, as pointed out above - see §43). Every sensible object can thus replicate (or, in perspectivist terminology, 'multiply') its causal effects through the medium. These effects are the so-called species , i.e. similitudes having mere intentional being (concl. 2, §31).\n\nThe question remains as to how the presence of the seen object in the eyes (its repraesentatio ) is provided. Does it occur by extramission of the powers towards\n\nthe objects or by receiving their species in the senses? Borotín uses this dilemma to argue against extramission in a way influenced by Peckham 120 . If extramission were the case, then the power would not only issue from the eye, reach the object and stop there. As the sensation occurs in the organs, the power would have to return to the eye and 'announce' the object to it. Such a conception is however absurd. Emitted powers would have to be animated, even rational and capable of voluntary movements, as they would go forth and return. Therefore, intromission appears to be a better option. Sensation occurs by species of the objects, multiplied through the medium and impressed in the eyes, which in turn cause the acts of sensation (concl. 3, §34). Additionally, every power whose operation is immanent (i.e. which produces nothing besides itself) is actualized only if it receives something from outside. The extramissionist explanation of vision would lead to a counter-intuitive conception of vision: the visual power would always be actualized (and never in potentiality), and its operation would not be immanent (§35). Intromission is thus a more plausible way to explain the mechanism of vision.\n\nBorotín's response could end right after conclusion 3. In that case, his position would amount to an Aristotelian intromissionist account of vision. However, he adds another conclusion which - perhaps surprisingly - rehabilitates extramission. Such a move would be unexpected, if it were not anticipated by the perspectivists of the thirteenth century, namely by John Peckham who is Borotín's direct source here. Extramission is introduced not as a single explanation of vision but in a way trying to make it compatible with intromission. In other words, Borotín (like Peckham) does not want to assert that extramission is the primary mechanism of vision, although it is somehow involved in a process which is generally intromissionist.\n\nBorotín implies two reasons why extramission may be appealing. Firstly, there is an ontological gap between crude material objects and the visual power which is,  after  all,  a  part  of  the  sensory  soul  and  thus  subtler  (albeit  not  as  completely immaterial as intellect). The species of the material object must therefore be refined and rendered proportionate to the visual power in order to be able to act upon it. This demand is met precisely by extramission - the power is emitted from the eyes (in the form of a cone) and makes the species proportionate to itself. The species are 'moderated' ( contemperantur ) and made suitable to enter the eye. If they were not moderated, sight would gradually be disintegrated by them (concl. 4, §36) 121 .\n\nSecondly, sometimes extramission of the 'natural light' of the eyes can substitute for external light when it is lacking. As commonly accepted, vision requires ordinary light - the color of objects cannot multiply their species without  being mingled with the light 122 . However, as some ancient anecdotes allege, some animals\n\n120 Compare §32 with Peckham, Perspectiva communis I, 45 (48), p. 128 (quoted in the edition).\n\n121 Borotín's source is Peckham, Perspectiva communis I,  46 (49), p. 128-130. Cf. also Rogerius Bacon, Perspectiva I.  7,  4,  p.  104-106  and  L.  Li/u010D.aka,  'The  Visual  Process:  Immediate  or  Successive? Approaches to the Extramission Postulate in 13th-Century Theories of Vision', in E. Baltuta (ed.), Medieval Perceptual Puzzles: Theories of Sense-Perception in the 13th and 14th Centuries , Leiden, Brill, 2020, p. 89-94.\n\n122 See, e.g., Peckham, Perspectiva communis I, 47 (50), p. 130.\n\ncan see in darkness. Borotín (again following Peckham) explains this precisely by advocating extramission: The visual powers of some animals are so strong that they can replace the outer light and give a 'power to multiply' ( virtus  multiplicativa ) even to color in darkness (§41) 123 .\n\nBorotín  therefore  combines  both  competing  positions.  The  primary  mechanism is intromission (the eyes receive species both  of  colors  and  light),  but  extramission is also involved in the process (the powers are emitted forth towards the objects in order to moderate and sometimes corroborate the species ). All three movements (the multiplication of species of colors and light, and the emission of powers) constitute three visual cones, with the apex in the eye and the base on the visible object - all occupying the same place (§37). Whereas perspectivists postulated only two cones (of species and of emitted power), Borotín adopts three cones from Bartholomaeus Anglicus.\n\nTo sum up, Borotín presents a compromise position. On the one hand, his answer to the question given to him by Hus is negative. In his view, sensations do not occur through extramission of the sensory power but rather by receiving the species of  the  object.  The  primary  mechanism  behind  vision  is  not  extramission but intromission. On the other hand, although he denies a robust conception of extramission, Borotín still argues for involving extramission (of visual power) in the visual process as important for 'refining' species coming from the outside to the eye. Is this an eclectic position, a superficial mixing of different sources without real understanding? It is worth noting that such a combination of intromission and extramission was quite common among medieval thinkers. Even Aristotle - although read as a strict intromissionist by thinkers like Albert the Great or Thomas Aquinas - was sometimes interpreted as conceding extramission 124 .  Stressing the extramissionist hints in Aristotle was common in the thirteenth century, especially among Franciscan thinkers (e.g. Bartholomaeus Anglicus, Bacon and Peckham). Not surprisingly, these authors also want to integrate extramission into their general account of perception. Thus, the compromise view presented by Borotín is derived directly from Peckham, but one may also find it in Bartholomew or Bacon 125 . The popularity of this position is also manifested by the fact that later in the fourteenth century it was held by John Wyclif who proposes it at least in his Trialogus 126 ,\n\n123 See also Peckham, Perspectiva communis I, 46 (49), p. 128-130.\n\n124 Especially some parts of his Meteorology (where he uses the notion of the visual ray to account for some meteorological phenomena), De animalibus (see §38 of Borotín's question), or De somno , where he  mentions  a  case  of  a  menstruating  woman  whose  gaze  allegedly  clouds  a  mirror  (2,  459b24460a23). The last passage (in Latin translation) is referred to in the excerpts from various texts on dreams written in Borotín's hand in his personal codex and interpreted as proposing extramission. See MS Prague, KMK, O 1, fol. 10r: '[…] facile hic videtur quod visus fiat extramittendo, ut per totum 3 m Metheororum videtur velle Aristoteles, ubi loquitur de refraccione visus.'\n\n125 Bartholomaeus Anglicus, DPR III. 17, p. 168, 169-170; Rogerius Bacon, Perspectiva I. 7, 2-4, p. 100-106.\n\n126 As mentioned in section II above, the evangelic doctor also ascribes this position to Augustine and Robert Grosseteste (Iohannes Wyclif, Trialogus II.  7,  p.  97);  see  also  Phillips,  'John  Wyclif ' , p. 258.\n\nwhich in turn inspired Hus in his preparation for discussion with Borotín. Thus, Borotín's conclusion was likely in consonance to what was regarded as the correct opinion among his peers during the quodlibetal session.\n\n## 4. Conclusions\n\nThis paper aimed to investigate the dissemination of perspectivist texts and knowledge of the discipline among Prague University masters around 1400. Despite the lack of optical manuscripts extant in Prague today, it has been documented that perspectiva was taught at the Prague Faculty of Arts at least from the 1370s and - on the examples of Jenek of Prague and Conrad of Soltau - that it was also referred to in philosophical and theological lectures. The main source for such investigation, however, is the Prague quodlibets organized from the 1390s to the 1410s. There are 13 questions explicitly dealing with optical topics included in the extant handbooks by Prague masters that organized a quodlibet . Some attest a considerable knowledge of perspectivist texts (Simon of Tišnov), while some are derived from other, more philosophical sources (namely from Wyclif, in the case of John Hus).\n\nThe only extant positio is the question on the mechanism of vision by John of Borotín. As it is a juvenile work by a fresh master of arts, expectations should not be too high. Borotín borrows extensively from De proprietatibus rerum by Bartholomaeus Anglicus in the notabilia section (on sensory powers and organs), but his position is influenced rather by John Peckham's textbook Perspectiva communis . He uses Peckham's arguments against extramission, but in the end proposes a compromise intromissionist account with some extramissionist features in a manner similar to Peckham. Nevertheless, Borotín's question is rather a cognate of Aristotelian psychological works than a full-fledged perspectivist text (e.g. Borotín includes nothing at all from geometrical optics) 127 .\n\n127 I am indebted to Ota Pavlíček and Pavel Blažek for discussions on the subject of this paper, and their valuable comments on the edition. My thanks also go to David Juste for sharing his copy of Borotín's codex with me, to Matyáš Havrda for his help in identifying the citations from Galen, and to Alena Hadravová for her hints on the dissemination of De proprietatibus rerum in Bohemia.\n\n## Appendix I Borotín's Notes in MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 18\n\nThe final redaction of Borotín's quaestio is preserved in MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 18 on fols 58r-61r among several different texts written in the same hand. All these texts constitute a part of the codex (55r-62v) which is - in terms of its handwriting - independent of adjacent parts. This part is also separated by blank folios (54 bis r - 54 ter v; 62 bis r - 62 bis v) 128 . As was argued above, this part of the codex may comprise folios Borotín himself used for recording notes, excerpts or preparing his own texts, and which were later bound together with other gatherings into one codex. A brief description of the contents of the passages written by what can be considered Borotín's hand follows:\n\n## 55r-56v: Notes on quaestiones on (human) intellect\n\nInc.: Sicud habet se sensus ad sensibilia, sic intellectus ad intelligibilia.\n\nNota: duplex est passio […]\n\nExpl.: […] ex 2  Metaphysice Buridani questione o .\n\nThis passage includes rather short quaestiones dealing with intellect. These notes or excerpts are of different lengths (some of them gather several arguments and notabilia, others a few sentences). The titles are: Utrum intellectus sit virtus passiva vel activa ; U. intellectus possibilis sit intelligibilis ; U. intellectus sit separatus ab intelligibili ; U. intellectus potest intelligere sine phantasmate ; U. calidum consumat ipsum humidum radicale (a mere title without text); U. indivisibile est intelligibile ; U. intellectus possibilis sit ens in pura potencia ; U. intellectiva anima sit forma substancialis .\n\nThe topics of all these questions belong to the tradition of commentaries on Aristotle's De anima III; the reference in the explicit indicates that they may be of a Buridanian origin. If written by Borotín himself, they may represent his reportationes of lectures on De anima or preparations for an exam.\n\nThe text seems to be written on a single independent bifolio.\n\n57r-57v: Shorter redaction of Borotín's Utrum sensationes […] - first part\n\nInc.: tur sic […]\n\nExpl.: […] et ista instrumenta iam … | in marg. inf.: motum, qui in prora, sensum.\n\nUtrum sensaciones fiunt per extramissionem virtutum ab organis sensitivis. ArguiQui ergo leditur in puppi amittit\n\n128 The composition of this part of the codex is not entirely clear at first sight, as the binding is very tight and the quires are mostly irregular. However, an inspection in situ revealed that fols 55-56 seem to represent an independent bifolio attached to a ternio (fols 57-62). All these folios are yellowed and timeworn, which contrasts with the brighter bifolio (54 ter + 62 bis) into which both the bifolio and ternio seem to be inserted. Such a quiring scheme (1+[1+1]+[3+3]+1) accords with the textual content of the gathering: while the bifolio includes Borotín's notes on De anima , the ternio preserves two versions of his quodlibetal positio .\n\nAs argued above, this part presents a preliminary, shorter but highly glossed version of Borotín's quaestio . It continues on fols 62r-62v. Note that fols 57 and 62 constitute a bifolio.\n\n## 58r-61r: Longer redaction of Borotín's Utrum sensationes […]\n\nInc.: Utrum sensaciones […].\n\nExpl.: […] questio, ut proponitur, est falsa.\n\nEdited below, see §§1-39.\n\n## 61r-v: Several notes connected to the main text of the quaestio\n\nInc.:\n\nVirtus, ut dicit Philosophus […]\n\nExpl.: […] qua sentiri debet sicuti est.\n\nEdited below, see §§40-43. Together with the preceding item, these texts are written on two bifolios (58-61).\n\n## 62r-62v: Shorter redaction of Borotín's Utrum sensationes […] - second part\n\nInc.: | … sunt sicud canalia que si obstruuntur per aliquam viscosum vel grossum humorem, cessat motus et sensus […]\n\nExpl.: Item ergo stantibus concurentibus sensu, organo eius, virtute, obiecto et medio et intencione actuali sensus super sensibile, causatur sensacio .\n\n## 62v: An excerpt on saliva from Bartholomaeus Anglicus\n\nInc.: Saliva in sapore est insipida […]\n\nExpl.: […] secundum qualitatem saporis rei gustate immutatur; hoc Constantinus .\n\nThis passage is not part of the preliminary version of the quaestio ; however, Borotín included it in the final one. See §25 in the edition.\n\n## Appendix II Critical Edition of John of Borotín's Quaestio utrum sensationes fiunt per extramissiones virtutum ab organis sensitivis\n\n## Ratio edendi\n\nThe question edited below is extant in a single manuscript (MS Prague, NK ČR, X H 18, fols 58r-61v). As argued above, the text preserved in the manuscript is written by the author himself in two versions. The aim of the present edition is more doctrinal than philological; thus, only the version the author considered final is edited here and the variants between both versions are not recorded. A full comparison of these two versions (merely indicated above) is beyond the scope of the present paper and may perhaps be the subject of future work on Borotín. Further, since the text is autograph, the additions, corrections and glosses, both marginal and interlinear (all of which are written in the same hand as the main text) are regarded as integral to the text itself and, consequently, are involved in the main edited text (the fact that they are later additions by the author is always indicated in the apparatus) 129 .\n\nI decided not to classicize the orthography, and the spelling of the manuscript is preserved even if it varies throughout the text (e.g. olofactus x ollofactus ). The only exception is a systematic distinction between the vowel letter u and the consonant v . Admittedly, this strategy of adhering to the manuscript's orthography does not free the editor from having to make a choice from time to time, especially when a medieval scribe's abbreviation enables different spellings. In such cases, I resort to the reading which is, to my best knowledge, more common in late medieval Bohemian manuscripts 130 .\n\nUpper-case letters are used in the edition to mark the beginning of a sentence, proper  names,  generic  names  used  in  reference  to  an  individual  person  ( Philosophus , Commentator ), or titles of texts. The titles are italicized. Abbreviations of the numerals are preserved (e.g. 3 o ). Roman numerals are not substituted by Arabic numerals and vice versa. The text is divided into sentences according to its meaning, the interpunction follows the logical order of the text rather than the punctuation in the manuscript, which is only occasional and often insufficient. The division into paragraphs preserves the original division in the manuscript\n\n129 I omit only the one-word glosses signaling the contents of the respective paragraph (e.g. the words vitalis and animalis on fol. 59r pointing to the parts of the text on the vital and animal power; see §16, and 17.)\n\n130 A special case is the Latin word for 'corollary' since medieval scribes used not only the correct variant corollarium , but also (and perhaps preferably) the incorrect variant correlarium . The present text includes seven instances of the abbreviation'cor m ',  which may be expanded in both ways (see §30 [twice], 31, 35 [twice], 37, and 39). However, §37 includes the derived adverb corollarie abbreviated as'cor'e ', which permits only the 'incorrect' reading e correlarie . Hence, I resort to the incorrect variant correlarium instead of the correct variant corollarium .\n\nonly partially: longer paragraphs are divided according to their sense. The paragraphs are numbered mainly to facilitate references. Quotation marks ('…') are used (i) to mark a piece of text that the author obviously intended as a quotation (usually, such a part of the text is preceded by an explicit reference to a particular author and/or his text); (ii) to indicate a tacit verbatim borrowing from another text by another author; and (iii) to mark an expression which is intended to refer to itself and not to its meaning (often preceded by ly in medieval Latin text). Square brackets ([…]) enclose words that I think should be deleted. Angle brackets ( &lt;…&gt; ) enclose words that I added, mainly headings and the numbers of the paragraphs. Editorial conjectures are indicated only in the apparatus by the abbreviation coni.\n\n## Conspectus auctoritatum\n\nAlbertus, Mineralia = Albertus Magnus, Mineralia . Opera omnia, vol.

Sicut enim cera recipit formam sigilli sine materia, sic sensus speciem sensibilis sine materia, ut vult  Philosophus 2 o De anima .  Species  autem  senciendi est similitudo materialis et propria rei, qua res materialiter cognosci habet sicuti est. Sunt autem sensus quidam interiores, quidam exteriores, sed dimissis interioribus, restringetur sermo pro exterioribus, de quibus magis videtur eodem questionis intencio.\n\n&lt;8&gt; Sunt autem sensus exteriores quinque - sensus visus, auditus, ollofactus, gustus et tactus - quibus fit sensacio, quarum eciam sunt organa quinque distincta secundum quinque corpora sensibilia principalissima mundi  corporei.  Primum  est  organum  visus  quod  est  quodammodo nature etheree ex eo quod est diafanum et lumen est sibi connatum, ut dicit auctor Perspective communis 46  proposicione primi: 'Lumen oculi a naturale radiositati sua conferre visui' . Sed quia organum visus faciliter recipit species et conservat, dicitur aquee nature.\n\n&lt;9&gt; Organum ollofactus est ignee, cum sit calidius et siccius. Auditus aeree: nam organum auditus mediante aere quodam in tortuositate auris complantato recipit species sui sensibilis et conservat. Organum gustus aquee, tactus autem terree. Omnis enim res corporea substancialis est nature alicuius illorum corporum. Similiter et organum. Dico igitur quod quilibet sensus habet suum organum, in quo suum exercet officium.\n\n&lt;10&gt; Organum visus est humor glacialis vel cristalinus, | ut dicit 36 a Communis  perspective :  'Visum  vigere  in  glaciali  humore' .

Que tunica si rumpitur, ita quod humor ille crystalinus effluit, visus corrumpitur, unde dicit Galienus I o De interioribus , quando quidam puer prefixit sibi humorem albugineum ita quod aliquot gutte eius eximit et tamen virtus visiva non fuit lesa, differens tamen est humor ille.

Organum gustus est quidam nervus a cerebro ad lingue medium ductus ad extremitates lingue ramificatus. Organum tactus est quidam nervus per totum corpus ramificatus et expansus sicud rethe. Et omnes isti nervi habent ortum de ventriculi cerebri a prora, i.e. anteriori parte cerebri.
