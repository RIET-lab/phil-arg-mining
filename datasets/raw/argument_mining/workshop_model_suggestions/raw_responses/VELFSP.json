Behavior expresses the effort to maintain the integrity and of the organization. unity unity\n\nLecky regarded self-consistency as the object of a cognitive or epistemic motive from which all other motives are derived. 4 .The subject must feel that he lives in a stable and intelligible environment,;\" Lecky wrote: \"In a world which is incomprehensible, no one can feel secure.\"5 The subject therefore constructs an organized conception of his world\\_an \"organization of experience into an integrated whole\" and this organization just is his personality; because the effort to maintain its consistency is what gives shape to his thought and behavior.6\n\nIf a person is to maintain consistency in his self-conception, he has to be consistent-~to think and behave in ways that lend themselves to a coherent representation. That's why the person's conception of his world, and especially of himself, can play the functional role of his personality: it organizes his thought\n\nCentral to the personality; s0 conceived; is the subjects conception of him The most constant factor in the individuals experience, according to Lecky; \"is himself and the interpretation of his own meaning; the kind of per son he is, the place which he occupies in the world, appear to represent the center or nucleus of the personality.

Some were offered $1 by the experimenter for performing this service; others were offered $20. Those who received only $1 for saying the' task was enjoyable subsequently came to believe that it was enjoyable; whereas those who had received $20 continued to believe that it was tedious. Festinger and Carlsmith hypothesized that the subjects who received only $1 experienced greater \"dissonance\" between their attitudes and their behavior; and altered their opinion in order to reducè this dissonance.\n\nThe effect reported by Festinger and Carlsmith has been replicated hundreds if not thousands of times; but its interpretation remains controversial. Festinger and Carlsmith did not clearly explain their dissonance hypothesis, and others have proposed alternative hypotheses to account for their results '3\n\n## 352 I David Velleman\n\n## Aronson's version of the dissonance hypothesis\n\nThe clearest version of the dissonance hypothesis was Aronson (1968).'4 Aronson proposed by Elliot argued that the subjects' cognition of their behavior was at odds with what would expect themselves to have done under the circumstances. What would expect themsèlves to have done, having found the task is to say that it was but found it that it was interesting: Their boring and said cognition of what had done therefore clashed wich the expectation that would naturally follow from their cognition 0f son, so that could their cognition of the circumstances, it consistent with their cognition of what had done. rendering they they boring, boring; they they they change they\n\nThis hypothesis relies on two assumptions that are not explicitly stated either by Aronson or by and Carlsmith. The first pointed explanation of Festinger\n\nThe hypothesis that Aronson thus framed in terms of expectations be framed in terms of explanations. Just can also as the subjects' cognition of found the task would lead to an expectation at odds with their said that it was interesting; 80 it would leave them at a loss to explain had said that it was interesting: Finding their behavior why it contrary to expectation would be two inexplicable and aspects of the same cognitive predicament. And changing their opinion of the task would resolve the under either description; by rendering their behavior both predicament dictable under the circumstances explicable and preas re-conceived. having boring having they finding\n\nThe pressure that induced these subjects to lie was covert: it was the sure exerted by the experimental setting and the authority conferred pres on the experimenter. by that set16 People are notoriously unaware of how powerful such pressure can be. Hence the subjects in Festinger and Carlsmith' s didn't know why lied. One group of subjects were offered experiment designed to seem adequate to them; while the others an explanation tion designed to seem were offered an explana with no authority; but $20 was sufficient for the subjects stranger been a sufficient to believe that it had inducement for them; whereas $1 was not. Hence some of the sabiocts butenot others were supplied with what seemed like an adequate nation of their behavior; or an adequate basis on which to expla expect it. ting they\n\nThe second assumption required by the dissonance hypothesis is that the changed it. The awareness of retroactively come to believe what had with an explanation of had said it; or with a basis on which their saying it why pected. The premise could have been exrequired to explain or predict their behavior was that had believed what were saying at the as said it. In retroactively having they they they they time, they\n\ncoming to believe what had said, then; must also have lieve; falsely; that had believed it all come to bethey they they along-\n\nAs supplemented by these assumptions; the dissonance hypothesis when people cannot identify the forces that have shaped says that their behavior; conjure up forces to make it seem intelligible and predictable\\_if retroactively forming a motivationally relevant attitude and necessary, by in time '7 This maneuver would projecting it back appear to be motivated by the subjects' desire for explanatory and predictive coherence in their self-conceptions; the sort postulated by Lecky: Hence the a motive of results of forced-compliance experiments; as explained by the dissonance hypothesis; appear t0 theory of self-consistency: support Lecky's they\n\n## A rival explanation: self-perception\n\nDavyl Bem (1972) has argued that subjects who seem to be motivated by cognitive dissonance are merely interpreting their own behavior as no were external observers: they\n\nJust as an outside observer might ask himself; \"What must this man's attitude be if he is t0 behave in this fashion in this situation?\" s0 too, the subject itly asks himself, 'What must my attitude be if I am ion in this situation?\" Thus the subject who receives SI discards the inducement as the major reflect his actual attitude; he infers that he must have must The actually enjoyed the tasks. subject who receives $20 notes that his behavior is adequately accounted for by the monetary inducement; and hence he cannot extract from the behavior information relevant to his actual opinions; he is in the same situation any as a control subject insofar as information about his attitude is concerned. (pp. 16-17) willing willing\n\nIn this \"self-perception explanation;\" Bem says, is no aversive motivational pressure postulated. As described by Nisbett and Valins (1972), \"Bem's reinterpretation of dissonance phenomena avoids the use of any motivationa] concept, and so \"the two positions appear to be at a logical impasse\": dissonance theory attributes the subjects' change of attitude to \"a motivated process ` whereas Bem attributes it to a passive; inferential 18 process . sthere\n\nBem's thesis is that a person often comes to know about his own attitudes in much the same way as we do when observing him from the outside. Bem's\n\nSubsequent research has shown that the correct explanation for dissonance phenomena is indeed motivational.!9 But I do not want to interpret this research as mistake, I believe; is in claiming that his self-perception explanation doesn' postulates the same motive as cognitive-dissonance and so the two theories give coordinate explanations that are mutually reinforcing 2 theory theory;\n\nformulation of the thesis suggests that a person receives his self-knowledge passively, as if by a process of sensory perception: But this suggestion is super fluous to the thesis and, indeed, incompatible with Bem's defense of it.\n\nOn the latter occasions, detecting the attitudes behind a person's behavior requires a process that is not passive and perceptual but active and intellectual: it requires &amp; process of interpretive inquiry: We will not undertake that process unless we have the requisite motives. If the meaning of someone's vocaliza tions or movements doesn't impress itself upon us immediately; we won't bother to figure it out unless we want to\\_that is, unless we want to understand what such occasions; interpretation is an activity that must be motivated.\n\nTo be sure, our knowledge of a person's attitudes is often obtained by a process that is quasi-perceptual. That person's vocalizations is of ten inseparable from hearing them as the assertioniof a particular proposition; and his bodily movements is often inseparable from them as an effort to attain a particular end. On other occasions; however; we hear a person's voice without hearing what he's saying, or we see his movements without seeing what he's and what he is saying or doing are then matters that we have to figure out. is, hearing. seeing seeing doing;\n\nperceptual, as in the phrases \"self-perception; 'interpersonal perception;' cial perception; pretation is passive and receptive rather than active and motivated: Even though Bem denies that one is automatically given a knowledge of one's attitudes, he calls the process of acquiring such knowledge \"self-perception;' and so he is naturally interpreted as describing a process that is passive. The possibility that self-perception might be &amp; motivated activity therefore goes unnoticed. \"So-\n\nNow; an interest in explanation and prediction is the basis of all consismotivation; according to Lecky. Consistency isn't desired for its own sake; its desired as the form of the predictable and the intelligible; by a creature who \"must feel that he lives in a stable and intelligible environment \" Inconsistency isn't intrinsically disturbing; it's disturbing because it stymies comprehension; and '[i]n a world which is incomprehensible; no one can feel secure.*21 A detency\n\nYet Bem himself implicitly concedes this possibility; when he says that an observer 'might ask himself, What must this man's attitude be if he is to behave in this fashion in this situation?' This question expresses the observer's desire to understand and anticipate, a desire without which he wouldn't ask the question or, having asked it, would let it go unanswered. Bem's thesis is that the subject \"implicitly asks himself\" the same question about himself, because a knowledge of his attitudes is not automatically given to him any more than it is to an observer: To portray the subject as this question is to acknowledge that he doesn't passively perceive his own attitudes but must sometimes actively inquire into them. It is therefore to acknowledge a motive for self-inquiry. willing asking\n\nsire for consistency in one's self-conception thus arises; according to Lecky, from the desire to understand and be able to anticipate oneself\\_the very desire expressed by the question that Bem attributes to the self-interpreting subject.\n\nLecky's insight was that the desire for self-knowledge can drive either of two; coordinate processes. If we want to understand what we we can either figure out why we've done after we've done them, or we can make sure that we don't do unless we already know The latter process entails only what we are aware of motives or other dispositions to and so it amounts to the process of true to ourselves by acting in accordance with our self-conceptions; the self-consistency process described by Lecky: The former process entails interpreting our behavior after the fact: it is the selfperception process described by Bem. Self-consistency and self-perception are self-interpretation. do, things, things why. doing having do; being\n\nHence the motive implicitly conceded by Bem is the same motive that is explicitly postulated by Lecky; the desire for self-knowledge. Bem should not the existence of this cognitive motive; since his own presupposes it. deny theory\n\nNote that dissonance-reduction lies on the intellectual side of this contrast. When a subject experiences cognitive dissonance; its too late for him to make his behavior consistent with his self-conception; he has t0 adjust his selfconception to fit his behavior; which is in the past. Bem and Aronson are thus describing one and the same process; of fitting an interpretive hypothesis to past behavior:\n\nIn Aronson's story; the subject begins with an interpretation that doesn't fit-\\_namely; that he believed the experimental task to be tedious\\_\\_and the rediscomfort moves him to frame a new hypothesis; that he believed the task to be fun. In Bem's the subject appears to have no initial interpretation; and so he isn't motivated by any discomfort; But he is still motivated by a desire for an interpretation that fits his behavior; the desire whose frustration of disagreement between Aronson and Bem is whether the subject was dissatisfied with one interpretation before moved to frame an interpretation that satisfied him.22 sulting story, point being\n\nThus; the dissonance theorist and the self-perception theorist aren't at a 'logical impasse\"= are in fact comrades in arms. Both are describing process of self-interpretation, motivated by a desire for self-knowledge:zs they\n\nIf the differences between dissonance theory and self-perception theory are s0 small, why do their proponents*believe that yield different predictions, and that are consequently The answer, I think, is that each theory isolates and simplifies one aspect of a and complicated reality. The reality behind both theories is the holistic process of an interpretation to behavior\\_a process that is complicated; in the first-personal case, by the possibility of working in the opposite directhey they large fitting\n\nby one's behavior to an interpretation: Each theory treats a single aspect of this process as if it were the whole, thus obscuring the fact that tion, fitting they\n\nI have already explained how self-perception theorists focus on the case of automatic; passive self-understanding; neglecting cases in which self understanding is attained through active self-inquiry; motivated partly byehe discomforts of reflective ignorance and incomprehension: The corresponding fault among dissonance theorists is a tendency to focus on individual inconsistencies of particular kinds; neglecting the overall cognitive goals in relation to which inconsistency is undesirable; in the first place. The narrow focus of either allows its proponents to state specific algorithms\\_an algorithm for dissonance; in the other These algorithms do yield conflicting predictions; which would be confirmed by different experimental outcomes. But the algorithms are radically underdetermined by the theories to which have been tached, and in both cases are implausible. Attributing attitudes and eliminating inconsistencies are two aspects of the overall process of mnaking sense of the world; a process that has not been and probably cannot be reduced to an algorithm. theory they they\n\nBut the \"prediction\" that Snyder and Ebbesen derived from dissonance depends on a very narrow view of the circumstances. To be sure, if the subject's belief that a task was tedious is made salient to him, then he will be more aware of its inconsistency with his statement that the task was interesting.27 But his initial belief would also be inconsistent with a that the task was will also be impressed on him by the salience of the former belief . Once he is made aware of without acknowledging that he has changed his mind, for no apparent reason; Thus; even as the discomfort associated with his initial belief is intensified; 80 is the discomfort t0 be expected from the alternative. theory esting\n\nConsider an experiment by Snyder and Ebbesen (1972), billed as \"a test of dissonance versus self-perception theory:' 26 This experiment modified a standard dissonance protocol by making salient to the subject either his initial Ebbesen claimed that making the subject's attitude salient to him ought to increase his awareness of dissonance between it and his behavior; thereby increashis tendency to alter the attitude; if dissonance were correct; whereas if 'self-perception theory were correct, making the subject's attitude salient ought to discourage him from attributing a different attitude to himself:. Snyder and Ebbesen reported that their results favored self-perception theory in this respecc theory ing theory\n\nWhat; then, does dissonance predict that the subject will do? Surely the theory cannot make a definite prediction in a case $0 under-described:. What the subject will do depends on circumstances that will vary from one subject to another; since he wili seek the most coherent view of the situatiòn all theory things\n\nconsidered:. Among the things he'll have to consider will be such what the task was; specifically; and how offensive questions as he is the sort of to his personal tastes; whether person to lie; or the sort of person to be unsure of' what he likes; whether he identifies with the experimenter or with his sellow and so on. If dissonance theorists think that they have subjects; ing how such questions will be resolved; an algorithm for predict also are mistaken. But their critics are mistaken if think that the failure of some particular algorithm the failure of the entails they they theory.\n\n## Another rival explanation: self-enhancement\n\nIhave now argued that self-perception theory tacitly cognitive motive that is explicitly postulated presupposes the same these theories can by dissonance theory; and that appear to yield conflicting predictions only if formulated with more precision than their shared theoretica] basis can support; But nance research. Others have explained that evidence in dissoclearly aren't cognitive by postulating motives that theory\n\nOf course, dissonance theory is not committed to denying the influence of the former motive Everyone prefers not t0 Iook foolish, and this preference may well be implicated the forced-compliance phenomena. Dissonance is merely committed to asserting the influence of an additional motive; a motive to avoid that which is inexplicable or contrary to expectation. But if the phenomena cited in support of dissonance theory can be completely explained ical support. empirtheory\n\nAccording to dissonance the Festinger-Carlsmith subjects came to believe what they had said in order t0 escape &amp; specifically cognitive ment, of unable t0 explain their behavior; or of predicaexpectation. But might instead have it contrary to come to believe what they had said in order t0 escape the appearance of having been irrational, in said it for no good reason; In that case; their change of mind would have 8imed to ratior nalize their past behavior rather than to remedy their current state of reflective ignorance Or incomprehension; and it would thus have aimed at removing not a fects of forced compliance have therefore been taken by other psychologists to indicate a motive for attaining a favorable view of oneself rather than for mainconsistency with one? actual self-view\\_a motive of self-enhancement rather than self-consistency.28 theory, being finding they having taining\n\n## Attribution Effects\n\nA number of experimenters . claim to have found dissonance effects that cannot be explained as instances of self-enhancement.29 But I am less inter-\n\nested in dissonance per se than in the cognitive motive for reducing it ~a motive that, as we have seen, can drive not only dissonance-reduction but selfperception and other attributional processes as well: I therefore prefer t0 draw further evidence from phenomena that don't clearly involve dissonance but turn out to involve the same cognitive motive:\n\n## Self-verification\n\nOne such phenomenon has been explored by William B. Swann, under the label 'self-verification. 30 Swann has shown that people tend to seek, credit, and retain feedback that confirms their actual self-conception; even if that conception is negative. Thus, for example; people tend to choose and feel committed to partners who view them as view themselves, for better Or worse.31 When interacting with someone who appears t0 view them differently; tend to behave in ways designed to him around to their view; even if it is unflattering 32 also lend more credence to his feedback about them, and are more likely to remember that feedback, if it confirms their conception 0f themselves, favorable or unfavorable.33 Jr., they they bring They\n\nThere is ample evidence for behavioral self-verification of positive selfviews, especially in children. This evidence is less than conclusive; because it can be explained, at least in part, by a motive for self-enhancement; but it is nevertheless   worth reviewing, since it coincides in interesting respects with Lecky's views.\n\nBecause these tendencies are associated with negative as well as positive self-conceptions, cannot be explained by a desire for self-enhancement.34 Yet don't exactly confirm the Leckian hypothesis. What Swann and his colleagues have found are biases in people's collection and interpretation of feedback from others. These biases well be motivated by a self-consistency motive such as Lecky postulated: But Lecky hypothesized that this motive would lead people to confirm their self-conceptions directly, by behaving in ways that verified those conceptions. Lecky's hypothesis was that people who think of themselves as poor spellers would not just choose friends who think of them as poor spellers, too, but would actually tend to spell poorly in order to be true to themselves: Swann's research does not demonstrate a tendency toward such direct, behavioral self-verification. they they may\n\nMiller, Brickman; and Bolen (1975) compared attribution and persuasion as means of modifying the behavior of elementary school pupils. In one exper iment, compared the littering behavior of children who had repeatedly been told that ought to be tidy (persuasion) with that of children who had repeatedly been told that were tidy (attribution). Both groups decreased their rate of littering, in comparison with both their own rate and that of a control group that was offered no messages on the subject. But the effects of attribution were significantly greater and lasted significantly longer than those of persuasion. Children who had been told that were showed a they they they prior they tidy sharp\n\nand lasting decrease in their rate of littering; whereas children told that ought to be showed who had been then only a moderate decrease in littering and returned to littering at the same rate as the control In periment, the same researchers found group. another exbution a similar difference in the effect of attriand persuasion on children's performance in arithmetic.

These results suggest that the technique depended on the children's motivation to behave in accordance with self-attributions of helpfulness or gênerosity induced by their first donation 36 they\n\nAll of these experiments seem to show subjects true to themselves by behaving in ways that verify self-attributions. Indeed, some of the experi ments seem to confirm Lecky's claim that such behavioral self-verification accounts for moral behavior; while others seem to confirm his corresponding claim about academic performance. Hence attribution research with children is at least consistent with Lecky's views on the connection between a bad speller and not being a thief. being being\n\nWhat would confirm the existence of a cognitive motive is evidence that people tend to verify self-conceptions that don't enhance their self-esteem. Some researchers have therefore attempted to demonstrate a tendency to confirm negative self-conceptions.\n\nUnfortunately; these findings involve the attribution of positive traits; and they can in principle be explained by a motive of self-enhancement.37 The rather than as a way of self-enhancement motive would not necessarily account for the difference in effectiveness between attribution and praise, or for the observed correlations with the development of trait-based self-understanding or with independently measured levels of motivation for self-consistency  But these phenomena may be too subtle to determine a choice between rival explanations.\n\nIn the classic experiment of this type, Aronson and Carlsmith (1962) asked subjects to identify the pictures of schizophrenics from among pictures that had in fact been randomly cut from a Harvard yearbook. Since subjects had no grounds for questioning the feedback received about their rate of success, that feedback could be manipulated by the experimenters.

The research appears t0 show; that we tend to act in first,\n\naccordance with the motives and traits of character that we conceive of ourselves as having; The research is also consistent with a second conclusion, that this tendency is due to a cognitive motive; to find ourselves explicable and predictable.\n\nIwill not repeat these arguments here.

This work by psychologists tends to support a philosophical theory like mine\n\nIn the past I have argued that creatures endowed with such a motive would satisfy our ordinary concept of an agent in the respects that often seem to make that concept seem unsatisfiable; Creatures s0 motivated would have futures that were open in a sense sufficient to afford them choices or decisions;44 would be the causes rather than the mere vehicles of behavior;45 would be guided by the normative force of reasons for 46 and would find such force in principles requiring them to be moral.47 they they acting; they\n\n## Philosophical Implications\n\nSome psychologists have gestured toward the philosophy of action in the course of discussing self-consistency motivation: Zillman, for example, having concluded that self-attributions of emotion can influence behavior; goes on to speculate that their influence makes for the difference between automatic mans ifestations of emotion and emotional actions that are under voluntary control:. In Zillman's view; an emotion involves some basic motor which responses, can be reinforced; suppressed; o redirected by the subject's interpretation of them. The basic motor responses to \"the primitive heritage of man; which we share with the lower animals, and are not under voluntary control; their modulation by the subject's self-interpretation manifests his \"rational capabilities; by which he controls his behavioral response.48 belong they\n\nBerkowitz draws a similar distinction between impulsive and purposive aggression  In collaboration with Tumner (1974), he manipulated the degree %f angerthat subjects attributed to themselves toward a particular person; thereby modifying the intensity of the 'punishment' that inflicted on that person, though not their aggression toward a third party; Berkowitz emphasizes that the attribution-governed aggression observed in this experiment was purposive rather impulsive.

Vallacher and Wegner (1985) therefore remark, \"although egoism and altruism can represent opposing forces in everyday life, arise from similar action identification 55 processes . got they they\n\nOn the basis of this and related experiments; Wegner and Vallacher have proposed a theory of action identification: The first principle of their theory is \"that people do what think are doing; identity; or act description; and then instantiating it in their behaviors6 The result, according to Wegner and Vallacher; is that people usually know what they' re doing, because are what think.57 they they they doing they\n\nThis principle can readily be interpreted as describing an intermediate in the self-verification process described aboves8 We can imagine; first, that the cognitively motivated agent selects a \"prepotent act identity\" consistent with the motives and other dispositions that he conceives himself to have. Conceivof himself as angry; he thinks of something consistent with such as retaliating; conceiving of himself as generous, he thinks of consistent with generosity; such as making a donation He thereby maintains the coherence of his self-conception. When he goes on to do what he is thinking, we can regard him as the next step in the same process. For we can imagine that he does what he's thinking in order to know what he's given that whatever he thinks he's about to do is the that he would consequently know about; if he did it. The agent thinks of something that fits his self-attributed motive; and then he does what fits this self-attribution of action; s0 that his self-conception is consistent with itself and with his actual behavior. step ing doing doing thing taking doing, thing doing\n\nWegner and Vallacher suggest that the agent's \"prepotent act identity\" is in fact an intention to act: in what he thinks; the agent is carrying out an now elaborated, onto the process of intentional action as ordinarily understood. Described in theoretical terms, the process goes like this: first something arouses the agent's anger; which already involves some behavioral dispositions; then the agent interprets his arousal as anger and thinks of what, in light of it, would make sense for him to finally; the agent's anger and his thought of behavangrily jointly cause the corresponding behavior\\_the behavioral impetus of the one regulated for consistency with the other by the agent's motive for making sense. But now we can redescribe the same process in ordinary language, by attaching the term 'motive' to the agent's anger and the term 'intention\" to his thought of behaving angrily: Thus redescribed, the process goes like this: the agent forms an intention that's consistent with his motive; and then he acts, under the impetus of his motive; as regulated for consistency with his intention. The of self-verification can thus be seen to coincide with ordinary understanding of intentional action. doing do; ing being theory\n\n## for reasons Acting\n\nIf the agent's what he is thinking constitutes the carrying out of an intention; then what about the preceding step; in which he thinks of doing what would make the most sense?

Aronson tends to describe the subject as changing his belief about the experimental task; Bem tends to describe him as attributing such a belief to his earlier self. As I have explained; Aronson's version requires the assumption that the subject not only forms the belief in the present but also pròjects it back into the past;, thus arriving at the same attribution as in Bem's version: But Bem's version says only that the subject attributes the belief to his earlier self\\_which, in principle; he could do without task to have been enjoyable; what Bem says is that the subject believes himself to have believed what he was saying when he said that the task was enjoyable. point\n23. In a paper presented to the 1967 Nebraska Symposium on Motivation, Harold connected dissonance theory and self-perception by way of attribution which he presented as containing a \"broad motivational assumption;' to the effect that attributional processes \"operate as if the individual were motivated to attain a cognitive of the causal structure of his environment:\" Commenting on the passage in which this statement occurred, Bem says: \"It is an admirable attempt, but the strongest motivation to emerge from this quotation appears to be Kelley' s need to understand why he was there\" (Bem [1972], P. 45). Kelley theory theory; mastery\n\nBut this in-principle difference between Bem and Aronson makes no difference in practice. Surely; if someone believes that shortly after finishing a task, he believed it to have been enjoyable; then he is likely to believe; in the present, that the task was enjoyable; unless he has some reason for doubting the truth of his earlier belief; In the absence of such a reason; he will probably be unable to attribute the belief to his former self without adopting it. Bem and Aronson agree that what the subject wants is to attribute the belief to his former self, s0 as to account for his behavior Bem doesn't mention that the subject will probably have to adopt the bes lief in order to attribute it to his former self, in the absence of reasons for it. But this omission hardly constitutes an important difference of opinion with Aronson. doubting\n\nThis remark is wonderfully self-refuting: Bem claims that the processes disYussed by Kelley involve no motivation; despite Kelley's assertions to the contrary: Yet Bem's attempt to discredit the latter assertions ends up confirming them instead. Bem suggests that we shouldn't credit Kelley's assertions about motivation because he made them only in order to satisfy his need to understand why he was addressing a symposium on motivation. The psychological process to which Bem thus attributes Kelley's assertions is one of the very processes whose existence was reason could we have for accepting Kelley's assertions as true than his having made them out of a need t0 understand himself?

Bem therefore concludes that such experiments support self-perception theory; according to which the subjects' self-attributions were based on their behavior rather than vice versa.\n\nYet there are many ways of accounting for the weaker effect on attitudes than on behavior; even under the hypothesis that the' attitudes came first in the order of causation. After all, the problematic correlations were observed, not with the attitudes themselves, but rather with the subjects' reports of those attitudes. gaps in the process of articulating self-attributions could therefore account for the results. Suppose, for example, that the subjects attributed anger or euphoria to them selves but not in s0 many words, or not in words at all. Perhaps they had mental images of those emotions images of facial expressions or bodily postures), which they immediately associated with particular kinds of behavior; but to which were not equally quick to attach names.

If their behavior was thus designed to facilitate the attribution; then it preceded the attribution in the order of causation; but it would still have been motivated by a cognitive interest in the self-understanding that the attribution would provide. they\n\n- 45 .
