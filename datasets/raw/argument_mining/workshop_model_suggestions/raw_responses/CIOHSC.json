The present study focuses on imaginable impossibilities in 14 th -century logic, underlining the relevance of Marsilius of  Inghen's  innovative  approach  through  a  comparison  with  the  semantic accounts  proposed  by  other  mid-14 th -century  Parisian  nominalists,  namely John Buridan and Albert of Saxony. In particular, this paper tracks the specific issue  of  the  admissibility  of  absolute  impossibilities  -  such  as  the  chimera  within Marsilius of Inghen's semantic analysis, proving that there is a sense in which the chimera is indeed treatable. The present study does so by analysing the issues involved in impossibilities on the levels of signification, supposition, and extended reference. In doing so it provides a clearer picture of the problems involved, where they emerge and why, as well as of the significance and range of Marsilius of Inghen's approach.\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThroughout the 14 th -century,  imaginable  impossibilities  ( imaginabilia ) make their appearance on the Latin philosophical scene, especially in natural philosophy, logic, and the logical analysis of scientific statements. 1 It is uncontroversial that items which are only relatively\n\n1. The appeals to imaginability occurring in the works of the Oxford Calculators have received more scholarly attention than their more refined developments on the Continent by some followers of John Buridan, such as Marsilius of Inghen and Nicolas Oresme. See e.g. J.  Biard ,  'La  signification  des  objets  imaginaires  dans  quelques  textes  anglais  du\n\nimpossible,  i.e.,  mere  impossibilities secundum quid (e.g.,  the  void, instants  of  time,  or  mathematical  points,  given  the  way  in  which Aristotelian physics pictures the world), are imaginable. However, for some authors, absolute impossibilities, i.e., logical and metaphysical contradictions (such as the chimera, the ass-man or, for us moderns, the  square-circle),  are  imaginable  as  well.  This  is,  for  example,  the case  for  Marsilius  of  Inghen's  account  of  imaginability,  which  will become paradigmatic in logic, semantics, and metaphysics throughout the later Middle Ages and well into the early modern period. 2\n\nIn this study, I examine in particular Marsilius of Inghen's account of imaginable absolute impossibilities in logic, tracking their thematisation and functions across signification, supposition, and ampliation theory. 3 I do so by taking into account some still understudied Marsilian texts (such as the Treatise on Consequences ) and by contextualising  Marsilius's  theory  in  comparison  with  those  proposed  by other  mid-14 th -century  Parisian  nominalists,  namely  John  Buridan and Albert of Saxony.\n\nMarsilius has been credited with having established imaginability as a proper logical modality - in Marsilius's jargon: 'a distinction of time' ( differentia  temporum )  -  in  the  context  of  ampliation  theory ( ampliatio ). The nature, workings, and goals of ampliation, its developmental history, and why it is either ignored or rejected by a number of authors while being embraced and developed by several others, are still mostly unsettled issues which cannot be sufficiently addressed\n\nXIV e siècle,' in: o. lewry (ed.), The Rise of British Logic , Toronto 1985, pp. 265-283; id. , Logique et théorie du signe au XIV e siècle ,  Paris 1989, pp. 229-230. For an overview on continental theories of imaginability in natural philosophy and logic, along with a detailed study on Marsilius of Inghen's take on relative impossibilities, see G. Ciola , 'The Void and the Chimera: Marsilius of Inghen on imaginabilia ,'  in: Medioevo 44  (2019), pp. 143-162. Interesting remarks on Marsilius's take on the chimera with some passages from Marsilius's Commentary on Aristotle's De interpretatione are in the critical apparatus of e. P. Bos (ed.), Marsilius of Inghen: Treatises on the Properties of Terms. A First Critical Edition of the Suppositiones , Ampliationes , Appellationes , Restrictiones and Alienationes, with Introduction, Translation, Notes, and Appendices , Dordrecht 1983.\n\n2. On the later discussions on these matters, see e.  J.  ashworth ,  'Chimeras  and Imaginary Objects: A Study in the Post-Medieval Theory of Signification,' in: Vivarium 16 (1977), pp. 57-77.\n3. The locus classicus on the signification and reference of absolute impossibilities in scholarly  literature  remains s.  eBBesen ,  'The  Chimera's  Diary,'  in: s.  Knuuttila -J. hintiKKa (eds.), The Logic of Being , Dordrecht 1986, pp. 115-143, to which I refer for a detailed and entertaining overview up to Buridan.\n\nhere. 4 Suffice it to say that ampliation is framed as a spin-off of supposition,  along  with  restriction  ( restrictio ),  appellation  ( appellatio ), and alienation ( alienatio ). At least in the 14 th century, ampliation, like supposition, is a property of terms in sentences, namely the expansion of the supposition of a term under the effect of some sentential part (e.g.,  an  adjective,  an  adverb,  a  tensed  verb,  and  so  on)  having  an ampliative  effect.  Ampliation  and  supposition  are  properties  of embedded occurrences of terms within well-formed sentences, in contrast  with  signification  ( significatio ),  which  is  a  property  of  terms taken  independently  of  any  propositional  occurrence. 5 Because  of some staples of medieval logic in general and Ockhamist semantics in particular,  terms  that  are  empty  or  necessarily  empty  because  they signify  impossibilities  pose  a  set  of  complications  on  every  level  complications  which  14 th -century  nominalists  address  in  different ways and with different outcomes.\n\nIn  the  scholarly  literature  on  necessarily  empty  signification  and reference the Marsilian engagement with imaginable impossibilities is not  a  novelty.  Yet  the  current  scholarship  is  somewhat  lacking  on several fronts. On the one hand, there has been a recurring confusion between signification and supposition (and, thus, ampliation), 6 which\n\n4. For an introductory overview of ampliation theory, see s. read , 'Medieval Theories:  Properties  of  Terms,'  in: e. n. Zalta (ed.), The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2019 Edition), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2019/entries/ medieval-terms/  (last  accessed  28  August  2020).  For  a  critical  take,  in  particular on    nominalist  accounts  of  ampliation,  see r.  Pasnau ,  'Medieval  Modal  Spaces,'  in: Aristotelian Society Supplementary Volume 94/1 (2020), pp. 225-254; id. , 'Nominalism's Modal Paradise Lost' [forthcoming].\n5. Some major exceptions are accounts of natural supposition. See l.  M.  de  riJK , 'The Development of Suppositio Naturalis in Medieval Logic I,' in: Vivarium 9 (1971), pp.  71-107; id. ,  'The  Development of Suppositio  Naturalis in  Medieval  Logic  II,'  in: Vivarium 11 (1973), pp. 43-78. Among the other properties of terms, for some authors appellation does not require sentential embedding either.\n6. In particular  on  Marsilius  of  Inghen's  and  his  fellow  nominalists'  dealings  with empty terms, see: t. dewender , 'John Buridan, Albert of Saxony, Marsilius of Inghen on chimerae, and impossible objects,' in: V.  M.  salas (ed.), Hircocervi  &amp;  other  Metaphysical  Wonders , Marquette  2013,  pp.  95-119,  esp.  pp.  104-113; G.  ronCaGlia , '«Utrum impossibile sit significabile»: Buridano, Marsilio di Inghen e la Chimera,' in: l. BianChi (ed.), Filosofia e teologia nel Trecento: Studi in ricordo di Eugenio Randi , Louvain-la-Neuve 1994, pp. 259-282; e. P. Bos ,  'Marsilius of Inghen on the Principle of Non-Contradiction,' in: J. l. FinK -h. hansen -a. M. Mora-MárqueZ (eds.), Logic and Language in the Middle Ages , Leiden 2013, pp. 403-418; Biard , Logique et théorie du signe (cit. above n. 1).\n\nhas so far caused a lack of clarity about which distinct semantic issues emerge  with  respectively  the  signification,  the  reference,  and  the expansion  of  that  reference  when  dealing  with  necessarily  empty terms. Consequently, there is still a need for a more systematic study tracking these issues throughout Marsilius's logic and outlining their specificities as well as their interconnections in an articulated fashion, beyond a nonetheless important overview and assessment of the Marsilian novelty itself. On the other hand, an analogous lack of clarity and of agreement among scholars concerns the type of impossibilities that are treatable within Marsilius's semantics. Does Marsilius's treatment of imaginable impossibilities include absolute impossibilities? Or is it limited to relative ones? Can absolute impossibilities be signified? Can they be supposited for? Can there be ampliation to absolute impossibilia ? Most existing literature on these subjects has focused on Marsilius's analysis of relative impossibilities, leaving absolute impossibilities on the sidelines, often dismissing them as untreatable. 7 Such an assessment is, nonetheless, at least partially incorrect, as the present study shows.\n\nTherefore,  in  this  contribution  I  track  the  specific  issue  of  the admissibility of absolute impossibilities - such as the chimera - within Marsilius of Inghen's semantic analysis, proving that there is a sense in which the chimera is indeed treatable. I proceed here by analysing separately the issues with impossibilities on the levels of signification, supposition, and extended reference. 8 This approach allows us to have a  clearer  picture  of  the  problems  involved,  where  they  emerge  and why, as well as of the significance and range of Marsilius of Inghen's approach.\n\n7. This dominant conclusion has been explicitly articulated and endorsed by e.g. ronCaGlia ,  '«Utrum impossibile sit  significabile»,'  especially  pp.  281-282.  On  the  other hand, while focusing on relative impossibilities, Ciola ( 'The Void and the Chimera') has recently argued that such a conclusion is unwarranted and that absolute impossibilia , such as  the  chimera,  should  in  principle  be  admissible  within  Marsilius's  logic.  The  present contribution fully develops and builds on the arguments sketched in that study.\n8. For an engaging overview on these matters, from the point of view of a rational reconstruction of 12 th - to 14 th -century theories, see: t. Parsons , 'The Development of Supposition  Theory  in  the  Later  12 th through  14 th Centuries,'  in: d.  M.  GaBBay -J.  woods (eds.), Handbook of the History of Logic ,  II: Mediaeval and Renaissance Logic , Amsterdam 2008, pp. 157-280.\n\nI  will  thus  proceed  as  follows,  structuring  my  exposition  in  two parts. I will begin by outlining the general semantic framework dominant in mid-14 th -century Parisian nominalism, as exemplified mainly by John Buridan and Albert of Saxony (1), in order to focus on the treatment of absolute impossibilia throughout Marsilius of Inghen's semantics (2).\n\n## 2. Some (properties of) terms: signification, supposition, and ampliation in nominalist logic after Ockham - a short overview\n\n## 2.1.   Signifying nothing\n\nIn order to clarify the semantic issues with necessarily empty terms - which are our main focus here - before delving into the heart of the  matter  it  is  desirable  to  sketch,  in  inevitably  generic  terms,  the shared background against which these discussions emerge, beginning with the notion of signification.\n\n## 2.1.1.   The basic notion of signification: a sketch of the 'nominalist' shared account\n\nIn  broad  strokes,  signification  is  the  most  basic  semantic  relation, generally defined as the function of a meaningful sign bringing something to mind. 9 In  the  medieval  philosophical  vulgate,  spoken  and written  words  in  ordinary  language  are  artificial  signs  instituted  to signify  conventionally  through  an  act  of  imposition  of  meaning ( impositio ). 10\n\n9.

Van  der leCq , vol. 4, Turnhout 1998, URL = http://www.logicmuseum.com/wiki/Authors/Buridan/Summulae\\_de\\_dialectica (last accessed 28 August 2020): 'cuiuslibet dictionis […] non materialiter sumpta […] interest significare et audienti eam conceptum aliquem constituere secundum institutionem sibi ad placitum datam. […] Et sic patet quod vox significativa debet significare audienti conceptum proferentis et debet in audiente constituere conceptum similem conceptui proferentis […]'; alBert oF saxony , Quaestiones  circa Logicam [= QcL ], q. 12, ed. M. J. FitZGerald , Leiden 2002, p. 198: 'Significatio autem termini est repraesentatio qua terminus repraesentat hoc vel istud, ad quod est impositus ad significandum vel quod naturaliter significat. Verbi gratia, sicut repraesentatio qua hic terminus: homo, mihi vel tibi repraesentat, vel ad memoriam reducit hoc ad quod est impositus ad significandum; vel semet ipsum vel sibi simile in mente, vel in voce, vel in scripto.'\n10. Cf. alBert oF saxony , QcL , q. 12, ed. FitZGerald , pp. 194-195: '[…] impositio termini est intitutio qua primus instituens istum terminum instituit sive imposuit ad\n\nDespite the development of profoundly disparate accounts, diverging on what qualifies as a meaningful sign, what is actually brought to mind - for example, whether it is concepts, forms or universals, intentions,  mental  terms,  or  actual  things,  etc.  -  and  how, 11 most medieval theories of signification usually share a similar underlying threefold semantic structure, involving: a spoken or written word in an actual language (i.e., normally, a regimented version of medieval Latin); an object or class of objects in the world; and either a metaphysical entity (e.g., a species, a form, or a universal, etc.) or a mental one (e.g., concepts, mental terms, intentions, etc.). 12\n\nSome authors active in Paris in the wake of William of Ockham (e.g., John Buridan, Albert of Saxony, Marsilius of Inghen, and Peter of Ailly) developed a group of semantic theories which share a common nominalist  flavour  and,  notwithstanding  some  differences  in terminology, articulation and detail, 13 present the same fundamental significandum. Et igitur, termini sic instituti dicuntur termini impositi ad significandum. Et est recte simile sicut si rex vel princeps alicuius patriae instituerit aliquid, puta florenum, valere 10 solidos. Unde sicut primus instituens aliquem terminum sic instituebat, quod tali  termino  sic  esset  utendum  pro  tali  re  pro  qua  imposuit  et  non  pro  alia;  sic primus impositor imposuit istum terminum homo pro homine et non pro asino. Et ulterius est sciendum quod si aliquis aliter hominum a principe alicuius patriae, sicut civis qui esset parvae auctoritatis, imponere quod florenus solveret 10 solidos, illa impositio modicum vel nihil valeret quia homines de tali impositione modicum vel nihil curarent.'\n\n11.

This exposition is in no way meant to be exhaustive nor to focus on the nonetheless important specific developments in signification theory that emerged after Buridan, e.g.  in  the  work  of  authors  such  as  Marsilius  himself  and  especially  Peter  of  Ailly.  In particular, Peter - building upon some hints that can be found in Marsilius's account develops a full-fledged double-track account of signification relations. This account maps, on  the  one  hand,  the  relations  of  signification  between  spoken  or  written  terms  and external things, and on the other hand, the relations of signification between spoken or written terms and the occurrences of the terms themselves in their inflected forms. Since here my aim is to explore issues with the signification of terms which cannot have any res extra as an actual or possibly actual significate - in virtue of such res extra being absolutely impossible - I will not consider the second track, focusing exclusively on the first one. (I thank the anonymous peer reviewer for their remarks on this subject.)\n\npicture of how signification works - which can be schematically represented by the following semantic triangle. 14\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWritten words ('item') immediately and non-ultimately signify spoken words (!item!). Spoken words non-ultimately signify concepts or mental terms (&lt;item&gt;) and ultimately signify items in the world ( res extra ). These items in the world are the ultimate significate of terms and are naturally signified by their corresponding mental term. What a term ultimately signifies, then, is that thing or those things in the world for which the term was imposed to signify.\n\nIn the way in which signification came to be predominantly characterised since the 12 th century, the significates of a given term include all  the  possible  items which that term could signify - be they past, present, future, or possible. A discrete name like 'Socrates', then, ultimately signifies an individual, i.e., Socrates; a common name such as 'man' ultimately signifies Socrates, and Plato, and Aristotle, and all of those things of which it can be truly predicated, by virtue of its subordination to the mental term &lt;man&gt;. 15 This is, roughly, the basic nominalist semantic picture found in Ockham's account and in those accounts stemming from it. Overall, such an analysis shows a pronouncedly extensional approach to signification. 16 The fact that the\n\n14. Here, as a convention, I am adopting a simplified and somewhat conventional terminology. Versions of this semantic triangle are common in secondary literature. See e.g. Parsons , 'The Development,' p. 187.\n15. See, for example, williaM oF oCKhaM , Summa logicae , I, c. 33, ed. P. Boehner -G. Gál -s. Brown , in: id., Opera Philosophica , vol. 1, St. Bonaventure (N.Y.) 1974. 16. read , 'Medieval Theories,' §1.\n\nultimate  significates  of  words  and  mental  terms  are  individuals  or classes of individuals, is in tune with the more preponderant role that supposition theory plays in 14 th -century logic, effectively taking over the spotlight that signification used to occupy within earlier logical texts  and  discussions  -  despite  signification  remaining  the  prior notion.\n\nThere are at least two fundamental semantic principles underlying these Ockhamist accounts of signification. First - and unsurprisingly, in  a  nominalist  framework - the 'middle-man' bridging words and things is something mental, i.e., a concept or mental term. Second, signification is ultimately about things in the world.\n\n## 2.1.2. Signifying nothing\n\nThe idea that the ultimate significate of words and concepts is some discrete object or a collection of discrete objects is taken to be one of the cornerstones of 14 th -century Parisian logical nominalism - which, after Ockham, is expressed by Buridan, Albert of Saxony, and Marsilius of Inghen, among others. This seems a straightforward consequence  of  the  ontological  parsimony  that  characterises  nominalist approaches.  Of  course,  this  approach  does  not  limit  the  scope  of signification exclusively to actually existing items, which would produce a counterintuitive and unsatisfactory account of how signification works. Evidently, signification can constitute for our intellect an understanding of no longer, or not yet existing items - or, put otherwise, significative terms include past and future objects (as well as, often,  potential  objects  bound  to  be  actualised)  in  the  set  of  their significates. But any strict interpretation of ontological parsimony will have issues  in  dealing  with  unrealised  possibilities  -  which,  at  face value, imply a somewhat generous expansion of the ontology 17 - and, even more so, with signifying unrealisable possibilities (e.g., significates that are naturally impossible given the way the world is taken to be, but not intrinsically so) 18 or impossibilities in a stronger sense\n\n17. Unrealised possibilities are all those individuals, belonging to a certain kind, that never were and will never be, as well as items such as the Golden Mountain in the traditional  medieval  example,  which  are  perfectly  possible,  both  naturally  and  absolutely, despite the fact that there was, is, nor will there be any such thing as a Golden Mountain.\n\n18. Given that, according to the Aristotelian picture of the world dominating in medieval  physics,  time  and  space  are  a  continuum  and  nature  abhors  the  void,  the  natural\n\n(e.g.,  those  intrinsically  contradictory  significates  constituted,  per definition, of incompossible parts, such as the chimera, the squarecircle, etc.).\n\nIt should be noted that, on the one hand, while these problems are more obvious within supposition and ampliation, they are nonetheless  present  also  at  the  level  of  signification,  insofar  as  signification ultimately revolves around signified individuals or sets of individuals. On the other hand, the most obvious issues are those with terms such as 'void' or 'chimera' - especially in those cases, like the chimera &amp; friends, carrying some kind of logical and metaphysical contradiction, i.e., an impossibility in a fairly strong sense. These problems are neither a 14 th -century novelty 19 nor do they receive a uniform treatment by our 14 th -century Parisian nominalists after Ockham.\n\nAs for  unrealised  possibilities,  neither  Buridan  nor  his  followers seem to perceive them as much of a logical difficulty, since in the underlying semantic account endorsed - relying on concepts' bridging role between the world and language - it is implied that signification  and  understanding  are  coextensive.  Not  admitting  unrealised possibilities would leave us with Golden Mountains and all sorts of unsignifiable understandings, yielding a semantic inconsistency in the theory. In the Tractatus de consequentiis [= TC ] and in the Summulae de dialectica [= SdD ], Buridan does not have any problems admitting unrealised  possibilities  'that  neither  are,  were,  nor  will  be,  but  are only  possibles' 20 within  the  scope  of  ampliation  (and, a  fortiori , within that of signification) on the basis that possibility scopes over all  possibles,  not  just  actualisable  potentialities,  and  that  unrealised possibles are indeed intelligible, at least to the mind of God. 21\n\nimpossibilities of this kind that we encounter throughout the medieval discussions are the void, instants, points, and so on. See e.g. Ciola , 'The Void and the Chimera.'\n\n19. eBBesen , 'The Chimera's Diary.'\n\n20. Translation by Stephen Read, in: John Buridan , Treatise on Consequences [= TC] , trans. and intr.

Buridan's account of the signification of terms signifying both relative and absolute impossibilities is well known. 22 Buridan's analyses of 'void' 23 and 'chimera' are substantially the same: there is no impossible significate  and  all  such  terms  signify  complex  concepts,  whose  simple parts naturally signify items in the world - such as, in the case of the chimera, the body of a goat, the head of a lion, the tail of a snake, etc. A term like 'chimera', then, is properly significative, but it does not  signify  any  significate  ( bene  significat,  sed  tamen  non  significat aliquid ),  since  there  is  no  such  thing  as  a  chimera  out  there  to  be signified. 24 Since in this picture there is no unitary significate beyond the complex concept for the term 'chimera' to ultimately signify, it is clear that 'chimera' will not have any supposition - and neither will 'void'. 25\n\nintelligit quae nunc nec sunt nec fuerunt nec erunt, sed sunt possibilia'; id. , SdD , 4.6.2, ed.

Albert of Saxony's take on the chimera and the void in the QcL is overall ambiguous, possibly due to the poor quality of the existing critical edition. Sometimes it looks analogous to Buridan's, with 'chimera' and the like ultimately signifying simpler (and possible) components of a complex concept (see e.g. alBert oF saxony , QcL , q. 5, ed. FitZGerald , p. 114; ibid . , q. 12, ed. FitZGerald , p. 195), but resulting in an overt and somewhat stronger rejection of the chimera's signifiability: 'Respondetur negando quod chymaera est opinabilis. Similiter quod sit intellegibilis et significabilis.' (ibid., q. 5, ed. FitZGerald ,  p.  116).  While  ultimately  not  endorsing  it,  in QcL ,  between  q.  13  (esp. pp.  204-207) and q. 19 (pp. 245-260), Albert seems to consider legitimate a position closer to Marsilius's, admitting into the realm of ampliation - and thus, of supposition and, a fortiori ,  of  signification - imaginable referents, including the chimera. For a fair assessment of Albert's account in QcL ,  a  more reliable edition is sorely needed. On the limitations of Fitzgerald's edition see h. weideMann ,  'Book Review,' in: History and Philosophy  of  Logic ,  25/3  (2004),  pp.  245-261.  Overall,  in  the Quaestiones subtilissimae super libros Posteriorum analyticorum Aristotelis I, q. 10, ed. Venice 1497 (esp. f. 9rb-va), Albert's position, while remaining very close to Buridan's, seems to have taken a step in\n\n## 2.2.   Supposition, empty reference, and the matter of the present\n\nOverall, supposition becomes such a central theory in 14 th -century logic - across decades and across schools of thought - because it provides a systematic semantic account of the truth conditions of sentences. 26 In its broadest characterisation, supposition is the property of subject and predicate terms 27 to  stand  for  that  thing  or  those  things  which  they signify and of which the sentence would be verified through its copula. 28 This  standing  of  a  term  for  something  is  the  core  operation  of supposition. Ockhamist theories of supposition tend to characterise this function  as  the  picking-out  of  an  item  by  pointing  at  it  through  a demonstrative pronoun. 29 Call this the '  Ockhamist pointing strategy'or the same direction as Marsilius's: 'chimera' is a complex term signifying a complex concept; this complex concept, as for Buridan, does not correspond to any single item in the world, but the composition in the complex concept itself appears to be imaginable.\n\n26. It should be noted that this is not a claim about the nature and main purpose of supposition theory, which have been widely debated in the literature and are beyond the scope of this paper. All that is being claimed is that one of the reasons for supposition theory's overwhelming preponderance in late medieval logical literature is that supposition - among the other things it does or it might aim to do - ends up providing a systematic account of the truth conditions of sentences. This much is quite uncontroversial and it is all we need for our present purposes. (I thank the anonymous reviewer for their remarks on this matter.)\n\n27. Throughout the history of supposition theory, it has been a point of contention whether the predicate term can have supposition proper or if some other property is doing an analogous job. For example, Peter of Spain maintained that predicates do not supposit personally, but rather supposit simply - e.g. Peter oF sPain , Tractatus called afterwards summule logicales , VI.10, ed. l. M. de riJK , Assen 1972. William of Sherwood, instead, held the view that predicates appellate but do not supposit at all - e.g. williaM oF sherwood , Introductiones in logicam , 5.15, ed. C. h. lohr -P. KunZe -B. Mussler , in: Traditio 39 (1983), pp. 219-299. Buridan maintains that the predicate term can supposit just as well as the subject does - e.g. John Buridan , SdD , 4.1.1, ed. Van der leCq : '[…] quia non est propositionis supponere, sed termini qui est subiectum vel praedicatum.' On the other hand, Albert of Saxony often characterises the referring function of the predicate as  the  appellation  of  the  predicate's  own  form  rather  than  supposition  proper  -  e.g. alBert oF saxony , Perutilis Logica II.11, ed. h. BerGer , Hamburg 2010, p. 394.\n\n28. E.g. alBert oF saxony , Perutilis logica II.1, ed. BerGer , p. 246: 'Suppositio, de qua hic intenditur, est acceptio seu usus termini categorematici, qui accipitur pro aliquo vel pro aliquibus in propositioni.' See also id. , QcL , q. 12-13, ed. FitZGerald , pp. 191209; Marsilius oF inGhen , Suppositiones, ed. Bos , p. 52: 'suppositio est acceptio termini in propositione pro aliquo, vel pro aliquibus, de quo, vel de quibus, verificatur talis terminus mediante copula talis propositionis.'\n\n29. E.g. John Buridan , SdD , 4.2.1,  ed. Van  der  leCq :  'solus  talis  terminus  est innatus supponere qui aliquo demonstrato per istud pronomen 'hoc' aut aliquibus demonstratis  per  istud  pronomen  'haec'  potest  vere  affirmari  de  illo  pronomine.' alBert  oF\n\n'pointing criterion'. Depending on the mode of supposition of a term occurrence, that term can stand for: itself and other linguistic items ( suppositio  materialis );  metaphysical items or concepts, mental terms, and the like ( suppositio  simplex ,  for  those  who  recognised  it); 30 and, when taken significantly, some of the items it signifies ( suppositio personalis ). For our purposes here, the personal supposition of denotative terms is the most relevant case; this is roughly analogous to ordinary reference. 31 For a term to supposit personally, the term has to pick out some of the items it ultimately signifies.\n\nLooking  at  most  mid-14 th -century  definitions  of  supposition (including Buridan's, Albert's, and Marsilius's), nothing would irrevocably tie the theory exclusively to the present, limiting it to an analysis  of  the  truth  conditions  for  present-tensed  categorical  sentences and, thus, to picking only presently existing items for the verification to be carried out. However, this is the way in which theories of supposition are articulated.\n\nFor example, in an affirmative sentence like 'Brownie is running' ( Brunellus est currens ), 'Brownie' stands for something - be it a horse or a donkey or a mule, etc.- that is signified by 'Brownie'. The sentence is true, if Brownie is actually running. But for that to be the case,  the  subject  term  'Brownie' has to have supposition, i.e., there saxony , Perutilis logica II.1, ed. BerGer , p. 246: 'Unde terminum in aliqua propositione dico accipi pro illo, de cuius pronomine demonstrativo praedicatum in illa propositione denotatur verificari affirmative vel negative. Verbi gratia, ut hic dicendo 'Homo est animal' vel dicendo 'Homo est nomen'. In prima istarum hic terminus homo accipitur pro Sorte vel Platone, quia de pronomine demonstrativo Sortis vel Platonis ly animal , quod est praedicatum praedictae propositionis, denotatur verificari per praedictam propositionem, ut dicendo 'Hoc est animal', demonstrando per ly hoc Sortem vel Platonem vel alium hominem.' See also alBert oF saxony , QcL , q. 13, ed. FitZGerald , pp. 201-203; Marsilius oF inGhen , Suppositiones , ed. Bos , p. 52: 'Ut in hac propositione homo currit , homo supponit pro quolibet homine qui est, quia de quolibet eorum mediante copula ista verificatur; quocumque enim homine qui est demonstrato hec est vera hoc est homo .'\n\n30. Some authors in the nominalist tradition, such as Buridan and Marsilius, do not recognise simple supposition as an independent mode of supposition, thus subsuming the standing of a term for concepts under material supposition. This outline is necessarily general and leaves out some nonetheless important discussions and features of supposition theory and of material supposition in particular, which does seem to have a significative use. See e.g. read , 'How is Material Supposition Possible?,' in: Medieval Philosophy and Theology (1999), pp. 1-20 [12-13 - particularly on Marsilius].\n\n31. Here,  I  will  also  ignore  the  branch  of  supposition  theory  dealing  with  ascent ( ascensus ) and descent ( descensus ).\n\nhas to be an actual referent ( suppositum ) for the term to point at and for  which  it  would  be  true  to  say  'this  thing  is  Brownie'  ( hoc  est Brunellus ). If there is no Brownie, then the subject term is empty and the sentence is false. 32 The same holds for all affirmative statements, both particular (e.g., 'some donkeys are running') and universal (e.g., 'all  donkeys are running') or also general statements about natural classes,  such  as  'all  donkeys  are  mammals',  which  would  be  false under this analysis if donkeys were to go extinct and the natural class were actually empty. This is the famous Existential Import (= EI) of affirmative categorical sentences; EI stems from the logical relationships constituting the Aristotelian Square of Oppositions 33 and is one of the most recognisable features of medieval logic.\n\nIn a way, it makes sense for 'all donkeys are mammals' to be false when there are no donkeys, insofar as the present tensed copula both in English and in Latin - normally carries a reference to the present tense, thus implying that there must be present referents for any affirmative statement about them to be true. 34 However, under the  standard  medieval  analysis,  all  statements  about  actually  empty classes would, strictly speaking, be false, including identity statements with empty subjects - e.g., 'the square-circle is a square circle', 'the chimera is the chimera', 'all dodos are dodos', etc. Nonetheless, it would still be desirable to be able to make true affirmative statements about things like presently empty natural classes, mathematical items, or idealised laws of natural philosophy. Most medievals do not want to forsake analogous statements either and explore several strategies to validate a number of them, at least in special circumstances. For\n\n32. Of course, 'Brownie is running' is false also if there is a Brownie but Brownie is not running.\n33. For a clear and synthetic overview on these matters, see T. Parsons ,  'The Traditional Square of Opposition,' in: e. n. Zalta (ed.), The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2017 Edition), URL = &lt;https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entries/ square/&gt; (Last Accessed 20 August 2020); ideM , 'The Development,' pp. 161-165.\n34. Some 14 th -century authors are very well aware of the tensed connotation of the copula as a linguistic feature of the Latin language. See e.g. John Buridan , TC ,  1.6.6, ed. huBien : 'Et ita dico quod hoc verbum 'est' praesentis temporis quod est copula in propositione facit stricte supponere tam subiectum quam praedicatum pro praesentibus, nisi praedicatum aliud operetur […].' For an interesting study on the predominance of the present in Albert of Saxony's semantics, see M. J. FitZGerald , 'Problems of Temporality and Scientific Propositions in John Buridan and Albert of Saxony,' in: Vivarium 44 (2006), pp. 305-337.\n\nexample, theories of natural supposition ( suppositio naturalis ) in their 14 th -century iterations, like Buridan's, propose a kind of atemporal or omnitemporal reference, with a removal of the copula's reference to the present, in order to respond exactly to such issues for general statements about natural classes and natural principles. A similar goal is also pursued in theories of ampliation like Marsilius's, scoping over imaginable referents. 35\n\nYet, none of these strategies saves the supposition of 'chimera', not even in identity statements: 'the chimera is the chimera' remains an affirmative  statement  with  an  empty  subject  and  is,  therefore,  false - even for Marsilius, who is otherwise often more ontologically permissive than most nominalists. 36 Hic non sunt chimaerae , it seems.\n\n## 2.3.   On ampliation, (its) status, and alienation\n\nOnce a term has (personal) supposition, that supposition can sometimes be extended. This is ampliation's job. Both among medieval authors and among their modern interpreters, the consensus on the theory is flimsy at best. Ampliation is normally taken to be the medieval way of treating modal and tensed sentences, namely by providing a semantic analysis of their truth conditions. 37 This is only partially true:  ampliation is a medieval way of treating some specific tensed and modal contexts - which ones, how, and why, are still matters of discussion.\n\nWith some generalisation, there seems to be two usual requirements for a sentence to be ampliative. The first is syntactic: normally, there has to be some sentential part warranting the ampliation. Only in a handful of exceptional cases, admitted only by a few authors, the pragmatic features of the discourse and common practices in specific contexts (e.g., the context of natural philosophy or\n\n35. For  a  more  detailed  examination  of  these  issues  and  the  possible  strategies  to address them, see Ciola , 'The Void and the Chimera,' pp. 146-150.\n36. See e.g. John Buridan , TC , 1.5.3, ed. huBien : '[…] Ideo enim haec non ponitur vera: Chimaera est chimaera , scilicet quia subiectum pro nullo supponit, ideo pro nullo eodem.'; alBert oF saxony , QcL , q. 13, ed. FitZGerald , p. 208: '[…] haec est falsa: Chymaera est chymaera […] quia per eam denotatur quod illud quod modo est chymaera, sit chymaera. Hoc est falsum, quia nihil est modo chymaera […].'; Marsilius oF   inGhen , Quaestiones in Sent. , III, q. 13, art. 2, ed. Strasbourg 1501.\n37. See eg. Parsons , Articulating Medieval Logic , Oxford 2014.\n\nthat of   mathematics) can warrant an ampliative analysis even without a properly ampliative term. 38\n\nAs for the second requirement, since in most theories supposition is taken to be supposition for the present (i.e., reference to some presently existing items), the ampliated term picks out its present and past supposita (i.e., those things picked out by the subject), or its present and future supposita ,  or  its  present  and  possible supposita .  In  other words, the most frequent analysis of the truth conditions given by ampliation aims to capture those cases in which there is a permanence of the suppositum between the present and the tense or mode to which the term is ampliated. But even this is not a requirement tout court : for some - like Marsilius of Inghen - the term does not need to have any supposition for the present in order to still have a properly ampliative (and possibly true) analysis.\n\nOverall, even limiting our focus to Ockham's Parisian followers, it is  impossible  to  outline  the  broad-strokes  of  an  underlying  shared theory, because such a theory is simply not there. Ockham himself went to some trouble to dismiss ampliation altogether; 39 some later authors around the end of the century do the same - for example, Peter of Mantua, who is otherwise quite 'Marsilian' in several respects, cannot really  see  the  point  of  the  theory  and  deems  it  to  be  utter nonsense. 40 Buridan,  Albert  of  Saxony,  and  Marsilius  are,  instead, among those who develop ampliation; they do so substantially and in substantially different ways.\n\nDespite some technical differences, Buridan's and Albert's accounts share  some  basic  features.  First  and  foremost,  for  both  of  them, ampliation is carried out starting from a term's reference to present referents. In SdD , Buridan defines ampliation as the expansion of the status of a term - ' status ' being the basic extension of the supposition of  a  term  which  can  be  ampliated  or  restricted.  For  Buridan,  the\n\n38. This  is,  for  example,  the  case  of  statements  about  mathematical  items  -  e.g., points, lines, etc. - in the analysis that Marsilius of Inghen endorses in his Quaestiones super libros Physicorum VI, q. 3, ed. Lyon 1518, f. 66rb-va. Analogously, Marsilius recurs to  an  ampliative  analyses  also  in  the  case  of  general  statements  about  factually  empty natural classes or when treating physical idealisations, such as instants of time.\n39. See e.g. G. Priest -s. read , 'Ockham's rejection of ampliation,' in: Mind 90 (1981), pp. 274-279.\n40. See e. P. Bos , 'Peter of Mantua and His Rejection of Ampliatio and Restrictio ,' in: o. lewry (ed.), The Rise of British Logic , Toronto 1983, pp. 381-399.\n\nstatus includes  exactly  all  the  significates  of  a  term  for  the  present tense. 41 Then, for the ampliative analysis to be viable, the ampliated term must have present supposita ; if this is not the case - e.g., if the term has only past or future referents - then the status of the term is removed entirely ( alienatio ). 42 While Albert's definition of ampliation does not appeal to the notion of status , it remains in the same vein as Buridan's and claims something even stronger: not only does ampliation  start  from  the  present  tense  and  a  term's  present  significates, but also from what is actual. 43\n\nBoth for Buridan and Albert the basic reference to the present can be ampliated to the past, to the future, or to the possible. 44 Given\n\n41. John Buridan , SdD , 4.6.1, ed. Van der leCq : 'Et oportet primo videre statum secundum quem terminus nec dicitur ampliatus nec restrictus, respectu cuius status aliquando dicitur ampliatio, aliquando restrictio. Status ergo ille  potest  assignari  quando terminus praecise supponit uel appellat pro omnibus suis significatis praesentis temporis; ut si dico 'homo currit' vel 'omnis homo currit', 'homo' supponit indifferenter pro omnibus hominibus qui in praesenti tempore sunt, et non pro aliis.'\n42. John Buridan , SdD , 4.6.4, ed. Van der leCq : 'Quandoque autem status praedictus termini non remanet, nec ampliatur nec restringitur, sed alienatur, ita quod terminus non amplius supponit, vel tenetur, pro praesentibus pro quibus supponeret, vel teneretur,  in  statu,  sed  solum  pro  futuris  vel  praeteritis,  nisi  contingat  quod  illa  futura  vel praeterita sint praesentia; et sic supponunt vel appellant termini sequentia verba praeteriti vel futuri temporis.' It should be noted that ampliation does not exhaust the medieval treatments of modal and tensed logic, since ampliation covers for those tensed contexts where the reference to the present should not be maintained.\n43. alBert oF saxony , Perutilis logica II.11, ed. BerGer, p. 368: '[…] ampliatio est acceptio alicuius termini pro aliquo vel pro aliquibus ultra hoc quod actualiter est, pro quo vel pro quibus accipi denotatur per propositionem in qua ponitur.'\n44. E.g. John Buridan , SdD ,  4.6.2,  ed. Van der leCq and TC ,  1.6,  ed. huBien . Albert is not quite as consistently clear as Buridan about the inclusion of possibilia within the  domain of ampliation: namely, he sometimes omits them from the list of tensed/ modal spaces to which the supposition of a term can be ampliated, despite their inclusion being implied by the theory and often made explicit by its further articulations. alBert oF saxony , Perutilis  logica II.11,  ed. BerGer ,  pp.  378-380: 'Omnia verba adhuc ispis praesentis temporis existentibus, quae sic se habent, quod habent naturam transeundi ita bene super rem praeteritam vel futuram vel possibilem sicut praesentem, sunt ampliativa terminorum ad omne tempus praesens, praeteritum vel futurum, ut sunt ista verba intelligo , cognosco , appeto et huiusmodi. Et causa est, quia res potest intelligi sine aliqua differentia teporis vel abstracte ab omni loco et tempore. Et tunc, quando res sic intelligitur, ita bene intelligitur res, quae fuit vel erit vel potest esse, sicut res, quae est. Unde si habeo conceptum communem in mente mea, a quo sumitur hoc nomen homo ,  indifferenter intelligo omnes homines praesentes, praeteritos et futuros. Et ideo, quia ista verba habent naturam transeudi ita bene super rem praeteritam vel futuram sicut super rem praesentem, ergo etiam habent naturam ampliandi accusativum, in quem transeunt, ad supponendum pro praesentibus, praeteritis vel futuris.'\n\nBuridan's stances on signification and supposition, for him possibilities  are  as  far  as  ampliation  can  go;  even  intentional  terms  -  e.g., 'thinking', 'knowing', 'understanding', 'signifying', 'desiring', 'imagining',  'conceiving',  etc.  -  cannot  ampliate  beyond  that. 45 This,  of course,  has  the  consequence  that  any  affirmative  statement  about impossibilities being thinkable, imaginable, understandable, signifiable or even desirable, within the context of ampliation, will be false: 46 the chimera is not understandable, or at least it cannot truthfully be said to be so.\n\nCertainly, the chimera could hold on to some hope on the side of alienation - given that alienation, for Buridan, deals with cases of reference to tenses other than the present, thus excluding all present referents altogether. 47 This  would, however, be a short-lived hope: in his brief overview of alienation, Buridan seems to limit alienation to the exclusive reference for past supposita or future supposita , but does not mention it applying to possibilia , let alone to impossibilia such as the chimera. The chimera &amp; friends, carrying an intrinsic  contradiction,  imply  a  total removal of supposition: in the world there are items signified by the possible but incompatible components of the complex concept underlying to such terms; yet, there is nothing that the term itself could be alienated from suppositing for. 48 Alas, hic non sunt chimaerae either!\n\nInterestingly, it is Albert of Saxony who, in the context of ampliation, seems to throw a non-committal lifeline to the chimera, while discussing  whether  intentional  terms  could  have  ampliative  force beyond the possible, i.e., to a distinct sphere of the imaginable and the conceivable. Albert is certainly aware that admitting conceivable\n\n45. Intentional terms of this sort are terms whose semantic properties are dependent on a mental act, a mental state, or a mental object. See e.g. John Buridan , TC , 1.6.1117,  ed. huBien ; id. , SdD ,  4.6.2,  ed. Van  der leCq :  'Quinto,  terminus  ampliatur  ad praeterita, futura et possibilia si construatur cum verbo significante actum animae intellectivae,  sive  a  parte  ante  sive  a  parte  post;  unde  haec  est  vera  'hominem  intelligo'  si Aristotelem vel antichristum intelligo, et haec etiam est vera 'intelligo rosam', licet nulla sit rosa.'\n46. E.g. John Buridan , TC , 1.5.4, ed. huBien : 'Et ideo credo quod nulla propositio affirmativa est vera cuius aliquis terminus pro nullo supponit praesente, praeterito vel futuro, uel saltem possibili. Unde has reputo falsas: Chimaera est intellegibilis , Chimaera est opinabilis , Chimaera significatur per hoc nomen 'chimaera' , posito quod impossibile sit esse chimaeram.'\n47.

Van der leCq .\n\nimpossibilities within the domain of ampliation would ultimately be inconsistent with his theory and, therefore, he prefers to evaluate as false those statements with ampliative intentional predicates scoping over subjects that are necessarily empty because they signify impossibilities. 49 However, he also explicitly recognises that, were someone to  welcome 'that which can be conceived or imagined' within the domain of ampliation,  then  an  affirmative  statement  such  as  'the chimera is opinable' could be ampliatively true. 50\n\nIf there is any chance of saving the chimera, at any level, our best chance is with Marsilius of Inghen.\n\n3.

My provisional  edition  of  Marsilius  of  Inghen's Consequentiae is  available  in: Ciola , Marsilius of Inghen and the Theories of Consequentiae , PhD thesis, Scuola Normale Superiore, Pisa 2017. A critical edition is forthcoming.\n54. Some broad premises in the background of this discussion, which should be kept in mind, are the following:\n- In a Buridanian vein, the underlying theory of predication is an 'identity predication  theory'  (see  for  example G.  KliMa ,'The  Essentialist  Nominalism  of  John Buridan,' in: The Review of Metaphysics 58 (2005), pp. 301-315).\n- While in a Buridanian framework, strictly speaking, sentences do not have supposition, which is a property of terms (see e.g. SdD 4.1.2.1), Buridanian authors commonly employ a  strategy  of  sentential  nominalisation  through dicta in  the accusative+infinitive  Latin  construction.  Such  a dictum supposits  materially  for instances of the original sentence of which the dictum is a nominalisation. A construction such as ' dictum+est verum ' - which for Buridan is implied by any sentence - is verified by whatever the original sentence was verified of. The dictum and the sentence of which it is a nominalisation, then, have the same semantic content. (See  e.g. G.  KliMa in: John Buridan , Summulae de Dialectica, translated  and annotated by G. KliMa , New Haven/London 2001, p. 844, n. 28.)\n- These dicta ,  then,  have a dual role and a twofold nature: on the one hand, they constitute the immediate content of the sentences of which they are a nominalisation; on the other hand, they are terms and, as such, have the usual properties of terms.\n- In a Buridanian context, complexe significabilia are  not  admitted, i.e., there is no proposition-like fact in the world.\n\nAlthough these matters are relevant, interconnected, and quite well studied, this will have to suffice by way of an introduction.\n\n55. On  Marsilius's  definitions  of  logical  consequence  and  logical  validity,  see G. Ciola ,  'Marsilius  of  Inghen  on  the  Definition  of  Consequentia,'  in: Vivarium 56 (2018), pp. 272-291. Marsilius's criterion of logical validity reads as follows: '  consequentia\n\nit  would validate consequences such as 'Homo est et asinus est, ergo homo est asinus' ('Man is and ass is, therefore man is an ass'). The objector's argument runs as follows. The consequent 'man is an ass' either [i] signifies for-man-to-be and for-ass-to-be, or [ii] it also signifies for-man-to-be-an-ass. 56 If [i], then the antecedent and the consequent would have exactly the same signification, therefore - per definition the consequence would be valid. 57 But if [ii] is the case, then the consequence would have an incongruous consequent, since for-man-to-bean-ass, being 'simply impossible', 'neither is, nor can be anything' and consequently - according to the objector - cannot be signified. 58\n\nAll that can be done to block [i] is to deny it: it is simply not the case that 'man is an ass' only means for-man-to-be and for-ass-to-be; instead, it only means that man is an ass. 59 To counteract [ii], then, one could deny that for-man-to-be-an-ass is nothing and it cannot be anything, claiming that it is instead something complexly signifiable ( complexe significabile ). 60 However, Marsilius's semantic views are still Buridanian enough not to admit the existence of complex   proposition-like bona est oratio sic se habens quod impossibile est sic esse qualitercumque per antecedens secundum eius totalem significationem pro nunc significatur sic esse, quin ita sit qualitercumque per consequens significatur secundum eius significatione pro nunc, et per consequens antecedens esset propositio sic se habens quod impossibile est esse qualitercumque per eam significatur pro nunc secundum eius totalem significationem, quin ita sit qualitercumque pro nunc per consequens significatur et secundum eius totalem significationem.' (ibid., p. 280).\n\n56. Marsilius oF inGhen , Consequentiae ,  I,  ed. Ciola : 'vel hoc consequens 'homo est asinus' significat hominem esse et asinum esse vel, ultra ista duo, significat hominem esse asinum.'\n\n57. Ibid .: 'Si dicatur primum, tunc propositum, quia antecedens et consequens precise significant idem.'\n58. Ibid .:  'Sed  si  dicatur  secundum,  inconveniens  est  quia  'hominem  esse  asinum' nihil est nec potest esse, et per consequens non potest significari. Consequentia videtur esse notam. Et antecedens ipsi declarant, quia hominem esse asinum, si esset vel posset esse, nihil posset esse aliud quam homo existens asinus, modo hoc est simpliciter impossibile quia homo non potest existere asinus. Quod autem hominem esse asinum nihil aliud posset esse quam homo existens asinus patet, quia hominem esse currentem nihil aliud est quam homo existens currens, prout isti alibi determinate supponunt.'\n\n59. Ibid .:  'Tenendo  definitionem  priorem  quidam  respondunt  ad  argumentum quando dicitur 'sequitur quod ista consequentia esset bona: homo est et asinus est, ergo homo est  asinus'  negando  consequentiam.  Et  quando  quaeritur  ab  eis  quid  significet consequens plus quam antecedens, scilicet utrum solum significet hominem esse et asinum esse, dicunt quod non, sed significat solum hominem esse asinum.'\n\n60. Ibid .:  'Et  quando  eis  arguitur  contra  quod  hominem  esse  asinum  nihil  est  nec potest esse, negant: dicunt enim quod est significabile complexe.'\n\nfacts in the world, thus rejecting complexe significabilia. 61 His refutation of [ii] is, therefore, based on a different strategy:\n\nEt quando dicitur hominem esse asinum nihil esse nec potest esse, conceditur;  et  quando  infertur  'ergo  non  potest  significari',  negatur  consequentia. Nam sufficit  quod  possit  imaginari  esse.  Non  enim  oportet  significatum propositionis esse vel posse esse, sed sufficit quod possit imaginari esse. Intellectus enim extendit se ad imaginabilia. Quod autem possit imaginari hominem esse asinum patet, quia, si forma humana cum forma asinina imaginarentur simul in eadem materia, licet hoc naturaliter loquendo sit impossibile, tamen imaginabile est hominem esse asinum - nam forma humana dat esse hominem et forma asinina dat esse asinum.\n\nAgainst supporters of complexe significabilia , here Marsilius denies that for-man-to-be-an-ass  is  or  can  be  anything:  for-man-to-be-an-ass remains an absolute impossibility, an incompatibility of forms. However, Marsilius also denies that, then, for-man-to-be-an-ass cannot be signified, since - for him - significates neither need to exist nor to be possible. Terms like 'chimera' or 'for-man-to-be-an-ass' can signify chimeras and ass-men just fine because these radical impossibilities are imaginable and, as such, are within the grasp of our intellect. In the semantic  picture  endorsed  here,  then,  the  standard  relations  of  the semantic triangle are still in place; but impossibilities are admitted in the domain of signification and, therefore, do not require to be analysed away into signifiable possible parts, as in Buridan's theory. 62 Chimeras, ass-men, and all sorts of absolutely impossible and contradictory items, are properly signifiable and understandable qua chimeras and ass-men, i.e., as unitary, simple significates. In this way, they are made into a proper part of the logical discourse and this is a radical novelty. Hic sunt chimaerae , indeed.\n\n## 3.2.   Much ado about nothing? The quest for impossible reference\n\nHaving proper significates is a necessary but not sufficient condition for terms such as 'chimera' to have supposition. Yet, the chimera -\n\n61. Ibid .: 'Sed istam opinionem non credo esse veram nec sufficere.'\n62. Buridan examines an example very close to the ass-man, i.e. that of the man able to neigh, in John Buridan , SdD , 4.66, ed. Van der leCq : 'Tamen sciendum est quod in ista propositione 'homo hinnibilis currit', ista nomina 'homo' et 'hinnibilis' sumuntur significative, quia utrumque nobis constituit conceptum suorum ultimatorum significatorum, ita quod utroque remoto reliquus supponeret pro suis significatis ultimatis.'\n\ndespite being signifiable, imaginable, and understandable - remains an  imaginable  impossibility  and,  as  such,  it  cannot  be  verified  of anything. 63 Between the Ockhamist pointing criterion and the underlying  EI  assumption  for  affirmative  statements,  within  supposition theory not much can be done for the chimera, given the standing definition of supposition. While Marsilius's treatment of the signification of 'man is an ass' extended to for-man-to-be-an-ass has eliminated some further complications with necessarily empty terms signifying  impossibilities,  nonetheless  an  empty  term  is  an  empty  term and, strictly  speaking,  it  does  not  have  any  supposition.  Insofar  as supposition theory is concerned, then, not even in Marsilius's Suppositiones is there any room for the chimera and her friends. 64\n\nAmpliation, however, is full of (im)possibilities - first and foremost because of the radically different way in which Marsilius frames and articulates the theory compared to Buridan's and Albert's accounts, beginning with its definition: 'ampliatio est suppositio termini pro suis significatis respectu diversorum temporum indifferenter.' 65 Here, ampliation is described as an expansion of the supposition of a term to scope over its significates 'with regard to different times without distinction.' 66 In this framework, all that is required for ampliation are referents situated within at least two or more 'times' or 'distinctions  of  time'  ( differentiae  temporum ),  without  any  mention  of  the supposition of the present being the one undergoing such an expansion.  These  distinctions  of  time  include,  unsurprisingly,  the  three traditional tenses (the present, the past, and the future - which constitute the domain of tensed logic) 67 as well as the modal domain of\n\n63.

Et tales etiam dicuntur tempora, ut solemus dicere hoc est presens tempus , hoc est preteritum , etc.'\n\npossibility.  But Marsilius implements a further expansion to a fifth and independently defined modal space: that of imaginability - to be understood in the technical sense, which we have seen so far, of conceivable impossibility. 68 This is a substantially original development, yielding a modal logic in many ways similar to some versions of contemporary impossible world semantics. 69\n\nMarsilius can go down this road because of his semantic views and because of an overall reconceiving of ampliation theory. Marsilius's very definition of ampliation contains, in a nutshell, two radical innovations which  are  made  explicit  and  articulated  throughout  the  treatise  on Ampliationes . Firstly, for Marsilius, ampliation does not require taking the  supposition  for  the  present  along  with  whatever  other  tense  or mode to which that supposition gets extended - as had previously been the standard case. Therefore, secondly, if there can be ampliation from any  tense  or  mode  to  at  least  another  one,  and  if  ampliation  is  an expansion of supposition, then there is still an acceptable way of suppositing which is somewhat different from the one articulated in theories (and treatises) of suppositio proper - even Marsilius's - and can pick out supposita in any one tense (or mode) individually taken. 70\n\nFor  all  intents  and  purposes,  this  minimal  notion  of  supposition - bared of all further characterisations and requirements put in place in supposition theory proper - is functionally equivalent to Buridan's status , i.e., it is the basic reference that can be ampliated or restricted. But, contrary to Buridan's and Albert's views, for Marsilius, this mini-\n\n68. Marsilius oF inGhen , Ampliationes , ed. Bos , p. 102: 'Et possunt addi duo, scilicet 'posse' et 'imaginari esse', que licet non sint proprie differentie temporum, tamen in proposito sunt differentie temporum, nam respectu eorum termini supponunt in propositionibus pro diversis temporibus.'\n69. For a recent overview of non-normal modal logics appealing to impossible worlds and their use for modelling the space of conceivability, see F. Berto -M. JaGo , 'Impossible Worlds,' in: e. n. Zalta (ed.), The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2018 Edition),  URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2018/entries/impossible-worlds/ (Last Accessed 28 August 2020).\n70. Marsilius oF inGhen , Ampliationes , ed. Bos , p. 98: 'Quando igitur subiectum supponit tantum pro illis que sunt, aut solum pro illis que fuerunt, aut solum pro hiis que erunt, scilicet quando stat solum pro suis significatis ultimatis que sub una differentia temporis comprehenduntur, tunc dicitur stare restricte, quia stat solum pro suis significatis que significat respectu unius differentie temporum solum. Et ideo non dicitur ampliatio  ad  istam  suppositionem  restrictam,  quia  terminus  qui  ampliatur,  non  stat  pro  suis significatis pro uno tempore sive una differentia temporis, ymmo stat pro suis significatis et pro diversis temporibus indifferenter.'\n\nmal supposition neither is tied to the present nor to actuality, but it is instead the supposition of a term for its referents falling under the one distinction of time defined by the tense of the copula. While Marsilius does not use the label of status in his treatise on Ampliations , he does so in his little treatise on Restrictions and Alienations and the definition of status given there fits perfectly with the use of unrestricted and unampliated supposition at play in the treatise on Ampliations :\n\nEt primo considerandus est status secundum quem terminus non ampliatur nec  restringitur.  Status  enim  ultra  quem  terminus  sepe  ampliatur  et  citra quem terminus sepe restringitur,  est  suppositio  termini  pro  omnibus  suis suppositis,  aut  omni  suo  suppositio,  sibi  adequate  correspondentibus,  vel correspondente, respectu unius differentie temporis precise: vel presentis tantum vel preteriti solum vel futuri solum. Exemplum, ut homo currit , homo est animal , Adam fuit , Antichristus erit . 71\n\nHowever, neither the tenses mentioned here as candidates for hosting the status '  referents  nor  the  proposed  examples  overtly  include  the modal space of possibility and even less so that of imaginable impossibility. If the most primitive relation of reference can pick out only present, or past, or future items, then there would not be any hope for the chimera: 'chimera', 'for-man-to-be-an-ass', and all such terms would still be irredeemably empty.\n\nNow, the first question we need to address is whether, among the 'distinctions of time' within which basic supposition can be had, we can count also the possible and the imaginably impossible. As we have seen, Marsilius explicitly includes the possible and the imaginable besides the present, the past and the future - in the list of distinctions of time to which ampliation is admitted. 72 As far as possibilities are concerned, ampliation works smoothly. In particular, the extension of the supposition to possibilia happens through a revised version of the Ockhamist pointing strategy, i.e., a potential pointing or even a merely  possible  pointing. 73 So,  nothing  in  the  theory  forbids  the\n\n71.

Bos , p. 118: 'Et ideo in ista homo potest esse albus, li homo ampliatur ad supponendum pro isto quod est vel potest esse homo.\n\npossible  to  be  a  proper  and  unampliated status ,  insofar  as  nothing forbids a possible pointing to or picking out exclusively possible referents. This being the case, then, there is no reason for which subjects referring to merely possible but never actualised supposita should be taken as empty under all circumstances. Therefore, affirmative statements about empty classes, which cannot but be empty even if they are not strictly speaking impossible (e.g., mathematical ficta or  idealisations in natural philosophy, such as points and instants of time), can be true without any need for ampliative syntactic features being in place nor for an ampliative analysis at all. 74\n\nSuch statements, of course, when provided with the proper ampliative elements, can still be ampliatively true, because possibility and imaginability are distinct and independent 'distinctions of time' and e.g. intentional terms ampliate not only to the possible (like for Buridan and Albert) but also to the imaginable. 75 So, for Marsilius, 'the void is understandable' is ampliatively true: despite the void (in the Aristotelian picture of the world) never being found in nature, it is nonetheless both possible and imaginable - which verifies the statements  for  two  distinctions  of  time  and,  therefore,  is  enough  for ampliation  to  take  place  and  for  the  sentence  to  be  ampliatively true. 76\n\nHowever, the chimera, the ass-man, and their fantastical menagerie are contradictory in nature: not only are they not naturally possible, but  they  are  logically  and  metaphysically  impossible.  Then,  statements such as 'the chimera is imaginable' or 'for-man-to-be-an-ass is understandable' will be, strictly speaking, ampliatively false: were we to find chimeras and ass-men anywhere in modal space, it would\n\nUnde sensus eius est: 'quod est vel potest esse homo, potest esse albus'. Et simili modo ampliat hoc verbum est supradictum cum hoc additamento in potentia vel etiam cum hoc additamento possibile.'\n\n74. This seems to also be the case in the analysis of mathematical statements that Marsilius presents in the Quaestiones Super Libros Physicorum , VI, q. 3, ed. Lyon 1518.\n75. Marsilius oF inGhen , Ampliationes , ed. Bos , p. 124: '[…] terminus rectus a terminis significantibus actum anime interiorem ampliatur ad supponendum pro eo quod est vel fuit vel erit vel potest esse vel imaginari esse. Et sunt huiusmodi verba intelligo , diligo , cogito , appeto , desidero , provideo , imaginor et cognosco et similia. Ideo in ista intelligo hominem , li hominem ampliatur ad supponendum pro eo quod est vel fuit vel potest esse vel erit vel potest imaginari esse. Simili modo li homo ampliatur in ista homo intelligitur […].'\n\n76. On vacuum intelligitur , see Marsilius oF inGhen , Ampliationes , ed. Bos , p. 110.\n\nbe only in the domain of the imaginable; but this is not enough to ampliate, since ampliation requires referents in at least two 'distinctions of time'. Hic non sunt chimaerae either, it seems!\n\nNonetheless, the chimera might still have an appeal against her dismissal. There is not, there was not, and there never will be a chimera; there cannot be one either. Marsilius is clear on this: 77 'chimera' does not supposit - at least not for any present, past, future, or possible items.\n\nYet, an internally contradictory non-entity such as for-man-to-be-anass can be signified, imagined, and understood as one significate and not as merely composed concepts; therefore, that must be the case for the chimera as well. There is, thus, a sense in which it must be true to state, about absolute impossibilities, that 'the chimera is imaginable', 'the chimera is understandable', 'the chimera is signifiable', and so on, because the whole inclusion of imaginability within the semantic spectrum  depends  on  the  fact  that  such  impossibilities  are  imaginable, understandable, and signifiable per se. Therefore, given the Ockhamist underlying semantic framework, for such statements to be true, their corresponding pointing statements ('this is imaginable', 'this is understandable', 'this is signifiable') must pick out something - and there is nothing to be picked out anywhere but among what is purely imaginable and utterly impossible. Just like Marsilius admits an additamentum possibile , his semantics seems to bind him to having some sort of imaginary pointing, an additamentum imaginabile. In other words, the domain of imaginability has to be a domain for minimal supposition, i.e., it has to host a status . If imaginability does not have a status , then some of the very principles grounding Marsilius's semantics at the level of signification would be false and the whole construction would collapse with them. Here, the chimera might have found her safe harbour.\n\n## 4. Closing remarks\n\nIn this study I have examined the account of imaginable absolute impossibilities in Marsilius of Inghen's logic, tracking their thematisation and functions across signification, supposition, and ampliation theory.\n\n77. Marsilius oF inGhen , Ampliationes , ed. Bos , p. 104: 'Nam sic etiam sensus istius propositionis chymera erit esse iste: 'quod est vel erit chymera'. Et tamen non ampliatur, cum non supponit, et omnis ampliatio est suppositio.'\n\nWhile Marsilius's semantic theory remains firmly rooted within the nominalist  and  Ockhamist  tradition,  compared  to  Buridan's  and Albert of Saxony's semantical views, it presents a profoundly innovative  approach  to  the  semantics  of  terms  that  are  necessarily  empty because they signify impossibilities, on all levels.\n\nFor Marsilius, absolute impossibilities - such as the chimera or the ass-man - are imaginable, understandable, and properly signifiable as unitary significates rather than as a collection of disparate parts subsumed under a complex concept. Along with a general reformulation of the scope, aims, and workings of ampliation and of the notion of status ,  this  allows  for  a  coherent  and  systematic  extension  of  the modal space to the domain of imaginable impossibilities, which looks a lot like a medieval counterpart to contemporary Impossible Worlds Semantics.\n\nChimeras might not have supposition proper, nor ampliation, but they do have signification and are allowed within the 'distinction of time' pertaining to the purely imaginable, therefore they must have a kind of basic reference, a status , within that modal space. It might not be much, but it is still better than nothing!\n\nGraziana Ciola Radboud University Nijmegen Center for the History of Philosophy and Science PO Box 9103 Nl-6500 HD Nijmegen g.ciola@ftr.ru.nl",
