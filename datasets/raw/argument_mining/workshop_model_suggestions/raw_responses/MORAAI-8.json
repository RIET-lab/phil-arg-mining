The standard account would go like this: under the action of light, a thing's colour produces a species of itself in a medium, the transparent; the species reproduces itself until it reaches the organ of vision, the eye, where it causes the vision of the colour.5 Regarding the cognition of essences, however, there is not an all -encompassing or standard medieval account, for even within the same tradition (for instance, the tradition of thirteenthcentury Parisian commentaries on Aristotle's De anima ) there are substantial differences from\n\n1 For the continuation of this medieval tradition in the 14th c entury, see chapter six below. For the relevant passages in Aristotle, see the introduction to this volume, sections one and two.\n\n2 For details of the Aristotelian tradition in late antiquity, see chapter one.\n\n3 I here discuss medieval authors working at an already -established medieval university in the thirteenth century. Scotism, Ockhamism, and Buridanism dramatically change the medieval landscape, but I will not consider that part of the medieval tradition in this chapter.\n\n4 Some  exceptions  are  Robert  Kilwardby  and  Peter  John  Olivi;  for  their  views,  see  Jos é Filipe Silva, Robert Kilwardby on the Human Soul: Plurality of Forms and Censorship in the 13th Century (Leiden: Brill, 2012); and Juhana Toivanen, Perception and the Internal Senses: Peter John Olivi on the Cognitive Functions of the Sensitive Soul (Leiden: Brill, 2013).\n\n5 See, e.g., the account in Albert the Great, De anima ,  ed.  C.  Stroick (M ü nster: Aschendorff, 1968), l. 2 , tr. 3 , cap. 8, 108-10.\n\nThis is an open access chapter distributed under the terms of the\n\none author to another. In fact, in the cognition of essences the reliance on a causal link is problematic because external things are material and the intel -lect and its acts are immaterial, and most authors from the period would argue that the material cannot act on the immaterial. I submit that the metaphysi -cal incompatibility between the immaterial intellect and the material world brings about a medieval case of today's 'Integration Challenge.'6\n\nThe Integration Challenge is the challenge that some contemporary episte -mologies face because they are either incompatible with the metaphysics that underpin them or nonexplanatory altogether in that they contain an explana -tory gap. For instance, they may posit a cognitive mechanism, say, intuition of  abstract  facts,  but  fail  to  provide  a  plausible  link  between  intuition  and abstract facts.7 The typical example of an integration challenge is the dilemma put forward by Paul Benacerraf regarding an epistemology of mathematical facts based on causal cognition and mathematical Platonism. There is, accord -ing to Benacerraf, a plain and significant inconsistency between a metaphysics of  mind-independent ,  causally  inert,  and  abstract  mathematical  facts  and an epistemology based on causation.8 The Integration Challenge was later gen -eralised by Christopher Peacocke, who describes it as: '[…] the general task of providing, for a given area, a simultaneously acceptable metaphysics and epistemology,  and  showing  them  to  be  so.'9  So,  not  only  the  epistemology and the metaphysics must be compatible, but one must also show that they are compatible by means of a plausible and positive link. A particular case today is the epistemology of essences, which some scholars place under the area of modal epistemology.10\n\n6 The challenge started to gain notoriety since it was formulated in Christopher Peacocke, Being Known (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1999).\n\n7 For an account of intuition of abstracta that attempts to meet the integration challenge, see John Bengson, 'Grasping the Third Realm,' Oxford Studies in Epistemology 5 (2015): 12-38.\n\n8 Paul Benacerraf, 'Mathematical Truth,' Journal of Philosophy 70 (1973): 661-79.\n\n9 Peacocke, Being  Known ,  1.  See  also  Sonia RocaRoyes,  'Modal  Epistemology,  Modal Concepts and the Integration Challenge,' Dialectica 64  (2010):  335-61;  and Ylwa Sj ö lin Wirling, Modal Empiricism Made Difficult: An Essay in the Meta-Epistemology of Modality (Gothenburg: Acta universitatis Gothoburgensis, 2019), 27-66.\n\n10 Followers of the Kripke -Putnam tradition take the epistemology of essences to be a spe -cial case of modal epistemology, but not everybody does. Fine and Lowe, for instance, take an opposing view. See Tuomas Tahko, 'The Epistemology of Essence,' in Ontology, Modality, Mind: Themes from the Metaphysics of E. J. Lowe , ed. A. C arruth, S. C. G ibb, and J.  Heil  (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018), 93-110. For the integration challenge in modal epistemology, see RocaRoyes, 'Modal Epistemology,' 335-61.\n\nEssences are, in fact, at the centre of the medieval discussions with which this  chapter  is  concerned. The medieval epistemology of essences is funda -mentally based on what medieval scholars called the first act of the intellect, that is,  the  intellectual apprehension of essences, or 'intellection.' I propose we understand the various accounts of intellection found in some medieval commentaries on Aristotle's De anima as  different  ways  to  go  about  solving 'The  Medieval  Integration  Challenge  for  Intellection.'  Medieval  accounts  of intellection are mostly concerned with the intellectual apprehension of the essence human , which among the followers of the Aristotelian tradition is nor -mally understood as the unitary form that makes some concrete thing be a human. In other words, a material essence is not just a bundle of essential properties, but rather the mind-independent formal unity x that makes some material  thing  be  an  instantiation  of x .  The  medieval  challenge  consists  in accounting for intellection in terms that are positively explanatory and com -patible with a given metaphysics of essences so as to make intellection a good basis for knowledge about them. For instance, a suitable account of intellec -tion will make the intellection of the human essence a good basis for the truth of, say, the thought that humans are animals in that it will provide a criterion to demarcate knowledge of this truth from cases of epistemic luck.\n\nI take it as uncontroversial that the medieval authors here considered take essences to be mind-independent (they  are  all  realists  about  essences)  and immaterial (essences are forms as opposed to matter). While I will refer to 'material' essences, I do not mean that the essences themselves are material but rather that they are forms of material things. For the authors considered in this chapter, material essences are causally inert as regards intellection. There is a minimal sense in which material essences have causal power though: they are forms, and hence are also formal causes. However, they cannot by them -selves act efficiently upon the intellect -  they cannot by themselves be what sets intellection in motion. Moreover, for the Aristotelian scholars here con -sidered, intellection is understood as a sort of affection. A conundrum clearly emerges: How is the causally inefficacious material essence related to passive intellection so as to make the latter a good basis for nonaccidental knowl -edge about that essence? The Medieval Integration Challenge for Intellection (henceforth MICI) can, then, be formulated as follows:\n\nMICI: The challenge of accounting for intellection by means of a (a) noncognitive / non-epistemic ,  (b) plausible,  and  (c) positive  link  between intellection and essence, which (d) makes intellection a good basis for nonaccidental knowledge about essences.\n\nThe link needs to meet the conditions (a) to (d) for the account to be explan -atory as regards an epistemology of essences, that is, as regards the possibility of  accounting  for  knowledge  about  essences.  The  link  must  be  (a) noncognitive / non-epistemic so  that  the  challenge  is  not  pushed  to  another cognitive/epistemic relation for which one would need to solve the challenge again. It must be (b) plausible, that is, able to obtain between essences and intellection (for instance, causation is an implausible link if one takes essences not to act causally upon the intellect). It must be (c) positive,11 that  is,  it  is not enough to show that essences and the intellect are not incompatible, as this would still leave an explanatory gap in the account as regards (d). Finally, (d)  it  must  make  intellection  a  good  basis  for nonaccidental knowledge in that it must provide a criterion, based on the intellection of an essence x , for demarcating accidental knowledge that x is p from nonaccidental knowledge that x is p .\n\nFor the sake of brevity, I will analyse the accounts of intellection in com -mentaries on Aristotle's De anima by thirteenthcentury scholars. I will focus here on three scholars, belonging to the Parisian tradition of commentaries on the De anima , who are representative of three notoriously different accounts of intellection: Albert the Great, Siger of Brabant, and Radulphus Brito.12 I will try to determine how each scholar deals with MICI. My aim is not so much to assess the philosophical quality of their accounts of intellection, but rather to make the subtle but significant differences between them stand out. Before I turn to the accounts in question, I will provide some background information about the relevant passages from Aristotle's De anima and some psychological tenets these authors all accept.\n\n## 2 Aristotle's De anima\n\nAristotle begins De anima 3.413 by outlining his agenda for the following parts (chapters 4 -8) of his enquiry on the soul, where he raises the question concern -ing the intellectual part of the soul ( ho noûs ) and its operation, intellection ( tò\n\n11 For 'positive,' see Sj ö lin Wirling, Modal Empiricism , 36-50.\n\n12 These  three  authors  can  be  considered  medieval  proponents  of  the  concept  empiri -cism  studied  in  chapter  seven  below,  although  it  is  questionable  whether  Albert  the Great's commitment to innate first principles threatens his consideration of as a concept empiricist.\n\n13 I will explain Aristotle's account only briefly; a more detailed description can be found in the introduction to this volume, section one.\n\nnoeîn ).14 He goes on to introduce a set of features that this part of the soul must have in order for intellection to come about. First, the intellect must be unaf -fected ( apathés ) yet susceptible of forms ( dektikòn toû eídous ). Second, it must be unmixed ( amigḗs ). Third, since its cognitive capacity is universal - it can understand all that is - the intellect must be undetermined, having no other nature than to be potential ( mēd'autoû eînai phýsin mēdemían all'ḗ taútēn, hóti dynatón ).  Finally, it must be disconnected from the body, that is, it must be separate ( chōristós ).15\n\nAt the end of chapter 4, Aristotle returns to the first feature, unaffected -ness, and anticipates an objection to the paradoxical character of the intellect as  both unaffected and susceptible of forms: how can intellection be a sort of affection if at the same time the intellect is unaffected?16 Moreover, how can the intellect be affected if it has no formal determination at all? In fact, as  Aristotle  himself  points  out,  the  explanatory  model  of  action/affection demands that the agent and the patient be of some common nature, that is, the agent and the patient must be of the same genus.17 The intellect, however, has no determination at all, hence no possibility to be affected by an external agent.\n\nIn order to explain how the action/affection model applies to intellection, Aristotle recalls in De anima 3.5 that every natural entity involves something material and something productive. He goes on to tell us that something analo -gous must occur in the case of the soul.18 Accordingly, he introduces a division of the intellect into 'the one that becomes all things' and 'the one that pro -duces all things,'19 without being explicit about the sort of division he has in mind. Aristotle also seemingly suggests that it is the latter ( hoûtos ho noûs ) which is separate, unmixed and unaffected,20 and closes the chapter by claim -ing that only the productive intellect is imperishable and eternal, in opposition to the material intellect, which is perishable.21\n\n14 De An. 3.4, 429a10-13. Some lines below Aristotle describes the intellect as that whereby the soul thinks and understands; see de An. 3.4, 429a23. For a detailed analysis of de An . 3.4, see Pavel Gregoric and Christian Pfeiffer, 'Grasping Aristotle's Intellect,' Documenti e studi sulla tradizione filosofica medievale 26 (2015): 13-31.\n\n15 De An. 3.4, 429a15b 5.\n\n16 De An. 3.4, 429b22-25.\n\n- 17 GC 1.7, 323b29-324a24.\n\n18 De An. 3.5, 430a10-12.\n\n19 De An. 3.5, 430a14-15.\n\n20 De An. 3.5, 430a17-18.\n\n21 De An. 3.5,  430a22-25. For recent interpretations of Aristotle's De anima 3.5,  see Victor Caston, 'Aristotle's Two Intellects: A Modest Proposal,' Phronesis 44:3 (1999): 199-227; Eli Diamond, 'Aristotle's Appropriation of Plato's Sun Analogy in De anima ,' Apeiron 47:3\n\nConfronted  with  this  chain  of  perplexing  claims  about  the  intellect  and intellection, any commentator on the De anima feels compelled to solve the puzzles raised by Aristotle's qualification of the intellect as unaffected and yet susceptible of forms, as well as those raised by its further division into a mate -rial part and a productive part.\n\n## 3 General Features of Medieval (Aristotelian) Theories of the Soul\n\nFollowing  in  Aristotle's  footsteps,  the  authors  here  considered  viewed  the human  soul  as  what  makes  some  properly  organised  material  body  be  an actual human being. The human soul has three faculties, vegetative, sensitive, and intellectual. The last two of these are cognitive and apprehensive; this is to say that the proper function of the sensitive and the intellectual faculties is the cognitive apprehension of an object. Further, two of these faculties, the vegetative and the sensitive, use bodily organs in order to perform their opera -tions. The vegetative faculty includes the powers that account for physiological functions  of  the  human  body  such  as  nutrition,  growth,  and  reproduction. The sensitive faculty, in turn, accounts for the cognitive powers related to the apprehension of particular material things. It includes powers of apprehend -ing things that are present and no longer present, the external and internal senses.22\n\nThe intellectual faculty provides us with the best evidence of our special place  in  the  hierarchy  of  natural  beings,  for  its  operations  are  performed without the immediate use of bodily organs.23 Following in the footsteps of the Arabic tradition, some authors (e.g., Albert the Great) divide the intellec -tual  faculty  into  four  intellects:  the  possible  intellect  ( intellectus  possibilis ), the  agent  intellect  ( intellectus  agens ),  the  theoretical  intellect  ( intellectus\n\n(2014):  356-89;  and  Michael  White,  'The  Problem  of  Aristotle's  'Nous  Poi ê tikos',' The Review of Metaphysics 57:4 (2004): 725-39. See also chapter one in this volume.\n\n22 See, e.g.: 'Potentiae igitur apprehensivae generaliter potentiae sunt passivae nec habent principia agendi nisi per formam, quam per apprehensionem acquirunt; propter quod etiam  apprehensivae  dicuntur […].  Et  earum  quaedam  sunt  apprehensivae,  deforis existentibus suis agentibus, quaedam autem sunt apprehensivae ita, quod sua agentia proxima sunt intus. Et illae quae habent sua agentia deforis sunt sensus […] de his autem quae sunt apprehensivae deintus, nunc determinabimus.' (Albert the Great, De anima 3.1.1, 166.)\n\n23 See, e.g.: '[…] ex maxima sua potestate separata est et nullo modo iuncta et umbrata per materiam corporis. Licet autem sic dicamus intellectum esse separatum, tamen anima est coniuncta per alias virtutes suas, quae sunt naturales sibi, inquantum est perfectio corporis […].' (Albert the Great, De anima 3.2.12, 193.)\n\nspeculativus ), and the acquired intellect ( intellectus adeptus ). Despite the mis -leading substantivisation that these expressions involve, they all refer to either powers (the possible and the agent intellects) or cognitive states (the theoreti -cal and the acquired intellects) of the intellectual soul: the possible intellect is an apprehending passive power and the agent intellect is a productive active power.  The  theoretical  intellect  is  the  intellect  as  actually  apprehending. Finally, the acquired intellect is the intellect that has reached its greatest level of perfection.\n\n## 4 Albert the Great\n\nAlbert  the  Great  was  undoubtedly  one  of  the  most  influential  and  prolific scholars of the thirteenthcentury.24 His historical importance notwithstand -ing, many aspects of his work are still not sufficiently studied. In particular, his  account of intellection has been somewhat neglected.25 My aim here is to show that, in his interpretation of De anima 3.4-5,  Albert puts forward a hybrid epistemology that seeks to meet MICI on the basis of a relation of deter -mination. He presents this relation somewhat vaguely, but I will attempt to characterise it more precisely.\n\nFor Albert, the human intellect does not have a determined form: it is not something that, like a molecule of water or a cactus, is determined by a form whereby it belongs to a certain kind. This is because the intellect could not understand  all  that  is  (for  instance,  apprehend  the  form  of  a  cactus  and  a cedar, of water and fire, and so forth) if it had a determined form:\n\nIf  it  were  indeed informed by some form so as to be something deter -mined […] this would prevent the cognition of everything […] because it could not receive what is contrary and what is different because of that form, because the diverse and the contrary cannot be in the same thing\n\n24 For Albert's life and works, see James Weisheipl, 'Life and Work of St Albert the Great,' in Albertus Magnus and the Sciences: Commemorative Essays ,  ed.  J.  W eisheipl  (Toronto: Pontifical  Institute  of  Mediaeval  Studies,  1980),  13-51.  For  Albert's  metaphysics  and anthropology, see the articles in Irven M. Resnick, ed., A Companion to Albert the Great: Theology, Philosophy and the Sciences (Leiden:  Brill,  2013),  part  2;  and  Alain  de  Libera, Métaphysique et noétique: Albert le Grand (Paris: Vrin, 2005).\n\n25 The most exhaustive analyses are found in Alain de Libera, Albert le Grand et la philosophie (Paris: Vrin, 1990), esp. 215-66; de Libera, Métaphysique et noétique , 265-328.\n\n[…] hence if it were some mixed form it would be prevented from poten -tially understanding all material things.26\n\nThus, the intellect is undetermined: '[…] the possible intellect is not a nature made specific by a form […] just as prime matter is not made specific by a form […] but its nature is to be only potential […].'27 And hence, it is unaffected:\n\n[…] the possible intellect is […] totally unmixed, because it is none of the  forms  it  receives,  which  are  either  forms  of  bodies  or  forms  that, although not forms of a body, are organic forms in a body, and hence it is not passible and transmutable, because only what is mixed is passible and transmutable.28\n\nThe intellect's unaffectedness follows from its indeterminacy, because affec -tion implies a change of form, which, in turn, implies having a form.29\n\nThereafter, Albert raises a series of problems related to these features of the intellect, including the following problem: if we are to explain intellection as an affection, how can the intellect remain unaffected during the intellection of an essence? In other words, he comes upon MICI. Albert sets out to account for intellection by means of a relation of determination in a way that preserves the intellect's unaffectedness and the inefficacy of essences upon the intellect.\n\nIntellection is the cognitive apprehension of an essence by the receptive power of the intellect, in particular the possible intellect. Otherwise put, intel -lection is the actualisation of the receptive power of the intellect in a process that  involves  a  material  essence  (the  particular  way  in  which  the  material essence is involved will be discussed in a moment). The material essence, in\n\n26 'Si enim esset aliqua forma informatus ad hoc quod esset hoc aliquid, tunc hoc ipsum […] impediret cognitionem omnis rei […] quia contrarium et diversum ab illa forma recipi in eo non posset, eo quod nec contraria nec disparata possunt esse in eodem […] et ideo, si esset aliqua forma mixta, impediretur, ne potentia intelligeret omnia materialia.' (Albert the Great, De anima 3.2.2, 178-79.)\n\n27 '[…]  intellectus  possibilis non est  natura aliqua  specificata  per  formam  […]  sicut  nec prima materia specificata est per aliquam formam, sed ad hoc tantum est natura eius posita potentialis […].' (Albert the Great, De anima 3.2.2, 179.)\n\n28 '[…] intellectus possibilis est […] immixtus omnino, eo quod nulla est formarum, quae recipiuntur  in  ipso,  quae  sunt  aut  formae  corporum  aut  formae,  quae,  licet  non  sint corporum, tamen sunt organicae in corpore. Et per hoc concluditur ulterius quod non est passibilis nec transmutabilis, quia nihil est passibile et transmutabile nisi mixtum.' (Albert the Great, De anima 3.2.2, 179.)\n\n29 Cf. Ph . 1.7, 191a6-7.\n\nturn, is potentially abstract and hence potentially intelligible, first, in the mate -rial things where it exists as concrete, and second, with respect to intellection inasmuch as it is not yet actually intelligible:\n\n[…] the theoretical intellect, which is a form considered in the possible intellect, is potential in two ways: one way is in the comparison of what is apprehended to the particular in which it is only potentially, because the particular has the universal in it only potentially […]. Another way is in the comparison [of what is apprehended] to the possible intellect, in which the universal is when actually apprehended […].30\n\nThe  material  essence  must,  then,  be  actualised  in  both  respects,  that  is,  as abstract  and  as  intelligible.  For  to  be  abstract  and  to  be  intelligible  are  not the same: to be abstract is a property of the essence in relation to material substrates, while to be intelligible is its property in relation to the intellect. However, the latter is grounded in the former, so that actualising the essence as abstract also actualises it as intelligible. The receptive power of the intellect is also potential in the sense that it can by itself neither bring about the actual intelligibility of the essence nor lead itself to the intellection of it.\n\nIn relation to the essence, Albert characterises intellection as a 'determina -tion'  of  the  receptive  power,  which  as  such  is  undetermined but capable of determination by something of a determined form:\n\nWhen the  universal  is  joined  to  the  possible  intellect  under  the  light of the agent intellect, it is not joined to it as to an organ, as in the case of sensible forms, but as what determines is joined to what is determined, because the connatural state of the possible intellect […] is of the same nature as the intelligible object insofar as it is intelligible. But the intel -lectuality of the possible intellect is confused and undetermined, and it is determined just as a potency by an act and just as what is undetermined is perfected by what is determined […].31\n\n30 '[…] intellectus speculativus, qui est forma speculata in intellectu possibili, in duplici est potentia. Quarum una est secundum comparationem eius quod intelligitur, ad particu -lare, in quo ipsum non est nisi in potentia, quia particulare non nisi secundum potentiam habet in se universale […]. Alio autem modo in potentia est secundum comparationem ad  intellectum  possibilem,  in  quo  est  universale  in  actu  intellectum […].'  (Albert  the Great, De anima 3.2.12, 194.)\n\n31 'Et quando sub luce istius intellectus unitur universale intellectui possibili, non unitur ei  sicut  organo,  sicut  fit  in  formis  sensibilibus,  sed  unitur  ei  sicut  determinans  unitur determinato, quia habitus connaturalis intellectui possibili, qui est intellectualitas ipsa\n\nDetermination by the essence involves, then, an actualisation of the intel -lect. Now, how can the intellect be actualised and yet unaffected? Moreover, is the intellect actualised by the essence itself?\n\nAlbert's analysis of intellection as a sort of affection sheds some light on the former question. There are two kinds of passive potency: one that underpins simple reception and one that underpins reception and alteration. The pas -sive potency of matter is of the latter kind: by being potential with respect to diverse forms and pairs of contraries, matter is subject to alteration insofar as it can become and cease to be something, or go from being one member of a pair of contraries to be the other one, for instance, from being cold to being hot.32 Hence, matter is first a subject of alteration, in the process of receiv -ing  and/or losing forms, and then a subject of reception, when the process of  alteration is  fully  achieved. The passive potency of the possible intellect, by contrast, is of the former kind: the intellect is not a subject of alteration but only of reception without alteration. Thus, the possible intellect is passive only equivocally: 'Thus, it is perfectly evident how the possible intellect differs from prime matter and that 'affection,' 'reception,' 'potency,' and such terms are said equivocally of the possible intellect and of the other receptive potencies.'33 And the intellect's being a 'subject of reception' is said only in an improper sense, because it 'receives' forms, but not as in a subject, as matter does:\n\n[…] the species  of  things  are  joined  to  the  soul  as  what  is  received  is joined to what receives, even though this unity is really neither the one of subject and accident nor the one of matter and form. But with 'sub -ject' taken broadly - that which somehow receives something else from which it does not obtain material being, but by which it is led to action with respect to a natural potency - the soul and the intentions that are in it are one subject.34\n\n[…] eiusdem naturae est cum intelligibilibus, inquantum sunt intelligibilia. Sed sua intel -lectualitas est confusa et indeterminata, determinatur autem sicut potentia per actum et sicut perficitur indeterminatum per determinatum […].' (Albert the Great, De anima 3.2.12, 194.) Cf.: 'Et ideo sic subicitur eis, sicut determinatum subicitur determinanti, et ideo non efficitur unum de intellectu possibili et intelligibili, sicut sunt unum materia et forma vel sicut subiectum et accidens, sed potius sicut perfectio determinans est in determinato et perfecto.' (Ibid., 3.2.7, 186.)\n\n32 Cf. GC 2.1, 329a24-35.\n\n33 'Et  per  istud  nunc  perfecte  patet,  qualiter  distinguitur  intellectus  possibilis  a  materia prima, et quod passio et receptio et potentia et omnia talia aequivoce dicuntur de intel -lectu possibili et a liis potentiis receptivis.' (Albert the Great, De anima 3.2.17, 203.)\n\n34 'Species enim rerum uniuntur animae, sicut receptum unitur recipienti, licet haec unitas neque sit proprie subiecti et accidentis neque materiae et formae. Large tamen accepto\n\nSuch is the sense in which the intellect is unaffected: although receptive in the sense of being actualised when determined by the essence during intel -lection,  the  intellect  does  not  suffer  alteration.  It  is,  then,  evident  how  the intellect's unaffectedness is dependent on its indeterminacy, for if it had any formal determination it would suffer alteration during intellection.\n\nThe determination by the abstract essence in intellection does not result in qualitative alteration, substantial or accidental, for during intellection the intellect does not acquire, substantially or accidentally, the form of its object:\n\n[…] and hence the intelligible object does not become one with the possi -ble intellect in the way that a subject and accident are one thing, because an accident is not a perfection of a subject; neither is there one thing as matter and form are one, because form perfects matter only as regards being and distinction and division, but the universal is non-distinct and undivided and does not perfect the intellect as regards being; rather, it is the principle of the cognition of things that exist; otherwise we should say that the intellect is a stone when it understands a stone […].35\n\nIn other words, determination by the abstract essence is neither qualitative change nor formal instantiation: the intellect does not become wooden when it apprehends wood nor does it become wood. During intellection the intel -lect's power of apprehension becomes determined in the sense that it takes on a form - it  becomes the intellection of  x ,  where x is  some  essence.  Just as buying an apple, bread, or a drink are different determinations of a coin's power to buy, in a similar way different essences are different determinations of intellection.\n\nAlbert  does  not  say  much  about  the  relation  of  determination,  but  we can  attempt  to  characterise  it  on  the  basis  of  his  passages  quoted  above. Determination, as he understands it, is (1) noncausal in the sense that it does not produce something (vs. efficient causality and formal instantiation); and\n\nsubiecto,  quod  subiectum dicatur id quod quocumque modo recipit aliud, a quo non habet esse materiale, sed quo perficitur ad agere secundum potentiam naturalem, quod anima et intentiones, quae sunt in ea, sunt unum subiectum.' (Albert the Great, De anima 3.3.12, 223.)\n\n35 '[…] et ideo intelligibile cum intellectu possibili non fit unum, sicut subiectum et acci -dens  sunt  unum,  quia  accidens  non  est  perfectio  subiecti;  nec  etiam  est  unum  sicut materia et forma est unum, quia forma non perficit materiam nisi secundum esse et dis -tincta et divisa, universale autem est indistinctum et indivisum et non perficit ad esse, sed potius est principium cognitionis eorum quae sunt; alioquin oporteret nos dicere, quod intellectus esset lapis, quando intelligit lapidem […].' (Albert the Great, De anima 3.2.12, 194.)\n\n(2) asymmetric (for instance, intellection is determined by the essence but not the other way around). It is also (3) ontological: being determined by x is an ontological constituent of the intellection of x , a part of what it is for the intel -lection of x to exist.36\n\nAlbert's appeal to determination is also conservative (that is, it makes use of notions dialectically acceptable in his context) if we understand determina -tion as akin to formal causation. Take, for instance, some apple. This apple is formally caused by the essence apple . The reason why this apple is a formal instantiation of apple is that apple has been received in matter . Also, apple is not the efficient cause of this apple; its efficient cause would rather be the apple tree. The relation of the essence apple to  this apple, insofar as it is its formal cause, looks otherwise very much like Albert's relation of determina -tion: it is not an efficient cause (at least not per se ), it is asymmetric, and it is ontological. Moreover, to be determined ( determinatum )  means precisely to have some form, as we have seen above in Albert's discussion about the intel -lect's indeterminacy, and to be determining ( determinans )  is,  accordingly, to give a form to something. Thus, it seems to me plausible to see determination as akin to formal causation.\n\nThat determination is asymmetric and ontological ensures that intellection is nonaccidentally correct. Thus, Albert tells us:\n\n[…]  hence  the  intellection,  which  is  a  simple  concept,  concerns  the essence of the thing and its substantial form, due to which something is some being […] because everything that is something through a substan -tial form will be that something and has the being of the substance. And this intellection, which is intellection by itself and properly, is always true by the truth of the thing, insofar as we call true what is truly and has true entity.37\n\nThe essence determines intellection as the essence is . This ensures that there is a difference between (1) any intellection of x which is determined by x , and\n\n36 In this sense, determination is akin to the relation of constitution which Bengson charac -terises in his paper and uses to account for the intuition of abstracta (Bengson, 'Grasping the Third Realm,' 16-20). Bengson qualifies his account as conservative (ibid, 34) because it is based on an already widely used and accepted notion of metaphysical constitution. 37 '[…] et ideo intellectus, qui simplex conceptus est eius quod est ' quid est res' et formae substantialis, qua aliquid erat esse […] quia per formam substantialem omne quod est aliquid, erit aliquid et substantialiter est. Et hic intellectus qui per se et proprie intellec -tus est, semper est verus veritate rei, secundum quod verum dicimus id quod vere est et veram habet entitatem.' (Albert the Great, De anima 3.3.2, 210.)\n\n(2) any intellection of x which is not so determined (think of some kind of intellectual hallucination of x ). This, in turn, explains why (1) is not accidentally correct with respect to x ,  for it involves a different relation of determination than  that  of  the  intellectual  hallucination.  Determination,  then,  seems  to fit  the  bill  in  terms  of  MICI,  as  it  is  an  asymmetric  and  ontological relation between intellection and the essence which provides a good explanatory basis for the realist epistemology of essences to which Albert is committed.\n\nAs we have seen, the intellect is unaffected in the sense that it is not altered so as to become x or so as to instantiate x , and yet it is receptive in the sense that it cannot lead itself to intellection. We have also seen that the essence is related to intellection through a relation of determination, which is noncausal except in the formal sense. Now, what is the efficient cause of intellection? In other words, what provokes or sets in motion intellection? Albert strongly sug -gests that the efficient cause of intellection is the agent intellect, even though intellection is diversified by the essence:\n\nThe theoretical intellect  has  double  being:  one  in  relation  to  the  light of  the  agent  [intellect], by  which  the  theoretical  intellect  is  produced ; another in comparison with the things of which it is a species and with respect  to  which  it  is  multiplied  and  diversified  according  to  potency and act.38\n\nIf  we  understand abstraction in Albert as the intellectual recognition of an essence in the sensory representation,39 we could say that abstraction is the efficient  cause  of  intellection  inasmuch  as  the  recognition  of  that  essence immediately provokes its apprehension. As we shall see in the following pages, according  to  Albert  we  are  naturally  equipped  with  some  first  principles that are instrumental to our capacity to single out the essence in the sensory representation.\n\nIn his commentary on the passage De anima 3.4, 429b10-22, Albert intro -duces  a  difference  between  (1) the  act  whereby  we  cognise,  for  instance, material  things,  which  he  calls  reflexive  intellection,  and  (2) the  act,  which we could call 'simple intellection,' whereby we cognise 'simple' things, among\n\n38 'Speculativus  autem  etiam  duplex  habet  esse,  unum  quidem  in  lumine  agentis, quo efficitur speculativus , alterum autem ex comparatione rerum, quarum ipse est species, et quoad hoc multiplicatur et variatur secundum potentiam et actum.' (Albert the Great, De anima 3.2.19, 205; my italics.)\n\n39 I assume that for all the authors analysed in the present chapter, the sensory representa -tion accurately captures the material essence so that the epistemic connection between intellection and the material world is not threatened at the level of perception.\n\nwhich we find the first principles. In the passage in question, Aristotle raises the question whether the soul discriminates ( krínei )  a  thing and its essence with different faculties or with the same faculty differently disposed. His puz -zling conclusion is that: 'one distinguishes [them] with another faculty or with the same one differently disposed. And generally, then, just as things are sepa -rated from matter, so are the things concerning the intellect.'40 Although in the Aristotelian passage it is not at all clear that what is at stake are different sorts of intellection, which are determined by and correspond to different sorts of object, this is the way in which Albert reads it. For he reads Aristotle's conclu -sion in the following way: things that include a principle other than themselves in their essence determine reflexive intellection. Accordingly, turning to such a principle fundamentally constitutes the intellection of those things:\n\n[…] hence, whenever the intellection of something includes something else, which is its principle, just as warm and cold, and humid and dry are the principles of flesh, and just as the continuous is the principle of the straight, as the subject is the principle of every proper feature, then it is necessary that the intellect first turn to the principle, either sensible, imaginable, or intelligible; and thereafter the intellect turns back to the intellection of that which it apprehends.41\n\nReflexive intellection seems to be an act in which during the intellection of its object the intellect necessarily has to turn to something else.42 For instance, once someone has already acquired the concept of the human essence, she cannot reactivate that concept and actually cognise the human essence with -out turning at the same time to the sensory representation of some human. Thus, during the intellection of the human essence, the intellect must have\n\n40 De An . 3.4, 429b20-22.\n\n41 '[…] et ideo quandocumque intellectus alicuius est alterius quod est eius principium, sicut caro principiatur a calido et frigido et umido et sicco, et rectum, quod principiatur a continuo, sicut omnis propria passio principiatur a suo subiecto: tunc oportet intellectum primo egredi ad principium, sive illud sit sensibile sive imaginabile sive etiam intelligi -bile, et tunc reflectitur ad intellectum eius quod intelligit.' (Albert the Great, De anima 3.2.16, 200.) Note that Albert extends the criterion so as to include also intelligible things with intelligible principles, which determine reflexive intellection. In this case, he says, the intellect goes from the intellection of x , to the intellection of p (its principle) and back to the intellection of x . Albert proposes the intellection of divine features as an example of this sort of reflexive intellection. See Albert the Great, De anima 3.2.16, 201.\n\n42 '[…]  et  egressus  quidem  vocatur  extensio,  reflexio  autem  circumflexio  vocatur,  quia terminatur  in  intellectu,  a  quo  incipit  prima  extensio.'  (Albert  the  Great, De  anima 3.2.16, 201.)\n\na material human, which is not an intelligible per se ,  in its consideration. In other words, we cannot think of the human essence without at the same time having some particular human in mind.\n\nTo the contrary, things that are principles do not determine reflexive intellec -tion. According to Albert, such things are grasped with 'a simple intelligence,' which especially concerns the first principles. In the intellection of the first principles, Albert tells us, the intellect stays in itself , that is, it does not turn to something else: 'But things that are completely separate, in the apprehension of which nothing is taken, such as the first principles, the intellect apprehends staying in itself; for it has in itself the first, most common principles […].'43 Simple intellection, then, concerns things that are themselves principles, and in particular the first principles (such as the principle of non-contradiction), the cognition of which, according to Albert, is innate.44\n\nSome sections later, Albert relates these principles to the agent intellect, which uses them as instruments for abstraction:\n\n[…] regarding the intellect of mortals, the agent intellect and the habi -tus of first principles, which we know by nature, [are] prior […]. In fact, these principles are instruments, as it were, with which the agent leads the possible [intellect] from potency to act, and these instruments are determined by the determination of the objects of knowledge […].45\n\nIt  is  not  clear  what  the  exact  relation  between  the  agent  intellect  and  the innate cognition of the first principles is, but it is clear enough (1) that our cognition of the first principles is innate;46 and (2) that the first principles play\n\n43 'Sed  separata  omnino,  in  quorum  intellectu  nihil  accipitur,  sicut  prima  principia, intelligit  intellectus  stans  in  seipso;  prima  enim  communissima  principia  habet  apud seipsum […].' (Albert the Great, De anima 3.2.16, 201.)\n\n44 'Et haec est veritas principiorum primorum; quae veritas semper est apud intellectum, quia, sicut dicit Boethius in consolatione philosophiae, 'communia retinet et singula per -dit', intendens per communia principia prima, sicut quod non contingit simul affirmare et negare et quod totum maius est sua parte et huiusmodi.' (Albert the Great, Summa theologiae sive de mirabili scientia dei ,  ed. D.  Siedler et a l.  (M ü nster: Aschendorff, 1978), 1.6.25.3.1, 156.)\n\n45 '[…] in intellectu mortalium etiam prior est intellectus agens et habitus primorum prin -cipiorum, quae scimus per naturam […]. Haec enim principia sunt quasi instrumenta, quibus agens educit possibilem de potentia ad actum, et haec instrumenta determinan -tur ex determinatione scibilium […].' (Albert the Great, De anima 3.3.2, 211.)\n\n46 See, e.g.: 'Ad secundum dicendum, quod dicta principia non sunt adeo communia sicut prima principia, quae sunt naturaliter cognita, sed sicut ea quae sunt propinqua prin -cipiis, ad quae potest haberi de facili via ex primis principiis.' (Albert the Great, Super ethica , ed. B. Geyer and W. K ü bel (M ü nster: Aschendorff, 1968), 3.2, 146.)\n\na fundamental role in abstraction, the act of the agent intellect.47 What Albert suggests here, then, is that our innate simple cognition of the first principles somehow allows us to recognise essences in sensory representations so that this recognition, which is the act of abstraction, immediately causes or pro -vokes the intellectual apprehension of the essence, that is, intellection. Thus, the act of abstraction is what sets intellection in motion, and so the former is the efficient cause of the latter.\n\nTo sum up, Albert meets MICI by understanding intellection in terms of determination,  which  is  a noncausal,  asymmetric,  and  ontological  relation between  the  essence  and  intellectual  apprehension,  and  which  provides  a good basis for knowledge of the essence. Strictly speaking, the efficient cause of intellection, what immediately provokes it, is the act of abstraction. Albert also  adheres  to  an  innate  cognition  of  the  first  principles,  thus  putting  for -ward a hybrid epistemology where (1) material things are cognitively accessed through perception, which is based on causation; (2) essences are cognitively accessed in an abstract form through intellection, which is based on determi -nation; and (3) first principles are accessed through innate cognition. Radical Aristotelians, as we shall see, will take issue with (2) and (3).\n\n## 5 Siger of Brabant\n\nThomas Aquinas is often interpreted as holding a causal account of intellec -tion, both by his medieval and contemporary readers.48 It is true that he often suggests that the intelligible species are the efficient cause of intellection,49 so that his works offer some evidence (although perhaps not decisive) to support\n\n47 See, e.g.: 'Talium igitur regulas et principia dare proprium est logici ad incomplexi cog -nitionem, quae a primis per se cognitis incipiat et deveniat in cognitionem eorum quae quaeruntur. Non enim omnia possunt esse incognita, quia sic quaerendo procederetur in  infinitum.  Principia  enim  prima  sunt  quasi  semina  per  naturam  cognitioni  homi -nis inserta, ex quibus quasi seminibus magni oriuntur fructus scientiarum de his quae cognoscuntur per ipsa. Primis enim positis per divisionem cognoscitur, quid potentia sit in ipsis, et ipsa divisio producit usque ad ultimum; propter quod etiam ipsa divisionis scientia necessaria est logico, ut dicit Boethius.' (Albert the Great, Super Porphyrium de V universalibus , ed. M. Santos Noya (M ü nster: Aschendorff, 2004), 1.6, 14.)\n\n48 For a recent interpretation, see Elena Băltuță, 'Aquinas on Intellectual Cognition: The Case of Intelligible  Species,' Philosophia 41  (2013):  589-602.  A  medieval  reading  along these lines is presented by Peter John Olivi; see, e.g., Robert Pasnau, Theories of Cognition in the Latter Middle Ages (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997), 168-80.\n\n49 See,  e.g.,  Thomas  Aquinas, Summa theologiae ,  ed.  P.  Caramello  (Rome:  Marietti,  1952), 1.85.4, co.\n\nthe  view  that,  for  Aquinas,  the  abstract  essence  'causes'  intellection  in  the sense that: (1) it provokes it, by (2) leading the possible intellect to actuality, and (3) informing it.\n\nSiger  of  Brabant50  rejects  such  a  strong  understanding  of  the  passivity involved  in  intellection,  not  least,  I  think,  because  it  causes  difficulties  for MICI - for how can the intelligible species act on the intellect? However, Siger's account of intellection also parts ways with Albert's, for he also rejects the lat -ter's understanding of the act of abstraction, notably the idea that it somehow works through our innate cognition of the first principles. In fact, like Aquinas, Siger  holds  that  humans  come  into  being  completely  devoid  of  knowledge (the intellect is a tabula rasa ), and have sensory cognition as the immediate or ultimate source of all possible knowledge. But, contrary to Aquinas and, I sur -mise, in order to meet MICI, Siger also puts forward an immanentist account of intellection.\n\nSiger's  account  of  intellection  starts  with  a  discussion  of  the  number  of agents  involved  in  the  actualisation  of  the  possible  intellect  and  their  role therein. He rejects a position that he explicitly attributes to Albert:\n\n[…] Albert's position seems to be that some cognition, namely that of the first principles, is innate in our intellect. […] not that they [i.e., the first principles] are the agent intellect itself, but they are the instruments of the agent intellect whereby it leads the possible intellect to action […]. I claim and believe that there is no innate cognition of intelligible things in our intellect but that it is purely potential in relation to all intelligible things […].51\n\nThe  intellect  is  purely  potential  (a tabula  rasa )  with  respect  to  intelligible objects, hence it innately cognises nothing at all. Moreover, the first principles\n\n50 For  Siger's  life  and  works,  see  Fernand  Van  Steenberghen, Maître  Siger  de  Brabant (Louvain: Publications Universitaires, 1977). For his accounts of the intellect and of intel -lection, see Carlos Baz án, La noétique de Siger de Brabant (Paris: Vrin, 2016). These authors also discuss the evolution in Siger's averroism from his Quaestiones in tertium De anima (c.1270) to his De anima intellectiva (after  1270),  notably the transition from a position according to which the separate intellect is the agent of knowledge to one according to which the agent of knowledge is the human being.\n\n51 '[…] videtur esse positio Alberti, quod intellectui nostro est innata aliqua cognitio, ut scilicet primorum principiorum. […] non quod ipsa sint intellectus agens, sed sunt instru -menta intellectus agentis, per quae educit intellectum possibilem ad actum […]. Dico et credo quod intellectui nostro non est innata aliqua cognitio intelligibilium, sed est in pura potentia ad omnia intelligibilia […].' (Siger of Brabant, Quaestiones in tertium De anima , ed. B. B azá n (Louvain: Publications Universitaires, 1972), qu. 12, 39-40.)\n\nare not required for intellection because the agent intellect, the possible intel -lect, and the sensory representation are jointly sufficient for it.52\n\nIntellection comes about because an intelligible object abstracted from sen -sory representations by the agent intellect is presented to the possible intellect, thus triggering intellection:\n\nWhen [the intellect]  goes  from  potential  to  actual  intellection,  this  is not because the cognition of some intelligible objects is innate to it, but because the intellect received from its creator, or from its nature, a natu -ral potency by which it cognises the nature of all intelligible things when they are offered to it. And this potency is the material or possible intel -lect. But the presentation ( oblatio ) of the intelligible things is made by the imagined intentions and the agent intellect. Hence, the things actu -ally apprehended actualise the material intellect.53\n\nThe intelligible object presented to the possible intellect actualises it. Now, a number of questions arise: What is the efficient cause in this process? What are the details of the 'presentation'? And, what is the exact link between the essence in the sensory representation and intellection?\n\nSiger  rejects  the  possibility  that  the  sensory  representation  directly  acts upon  the  intellect  because  there  can  be  no  causation  between  such  meta -physically incompatible things. In other words, causation cannot be the link between intellection and the material essence upon which an epistemology that meets MICI is based. Siger's alternative solution is to posit an intelligible object that is the direct cause of intellection, an object that is ontologically different from, albeit similar to, the material essence, produced by the intellect itself and metaphysically compatible with it (as, say, the picture of a human is ontologically different from, albeit similar to, the human). Hence, in order to meet MICI, instead of appealing to a relation of determination between the essence and intellection, as Albert did, Siger brings to the fore an immanent\n\n52 'Aristoteles in hoc tertio dat principia intelligendi tria, quae sunt intellectus materialis sive possibilis, et hoc est principium materiale, et intellectus agens et intentiones imagi -natae; requiruntur vero sufficienter ad actum intellectus.' (Siger of Brabant, In tertium de An. , qu. 12, 37.)\n\n53 'Cum autem exit de potentia intelligendi ad actum, hoc non est quia intelligibilium ali -quorum sit ei innata cognitio, sed hoc est quia intellectus a suo factore vel a sua natura habuit potentiam naturalem qua cognoscens est naturam omnium intelligibilium cum sibi  offeruntur.  Et  ista  potentia  est  intellectus  materialis  sive  possibilis.  Oblatio  autem intelligibilium  fit  per  intentiones  imaginatas  et  per  intellectum  agentem.'  (Siger  of Brabant, In tertium de An. , qu. 12, 40.)\n\nobject produced by the intellect itself and causally related to intellection. Let us see how this works.\n\nSiger begins by rejecting an account of abstraction in which, by an action analogous to that of light upon the colour, the agent intellect makes the essence contained in the sensory representation actually intelligible:\n\nSome […] imagine that the agent intellect throws rays illuminating the imagined  intentions  that  exist  in  the  organ  of  the  phantasy  and  thus makes them actually intelligible, just as light through its rays makes the potential colours actual colours.54\n\nThis account agrees, in fact, with what both Albert and Thomas claim to be the action of the agent intellect on the sensory representation, that is, the actu -alisation of the material essence's potential intelligibility. However, for Siger, the analogy with light and the colour is misleading in one significant respect: while colour is indeed potentially visible, the material essence (and, in general, everything that is in a material substrate) is not, and cannot be, potentially intelligible, as materiality and intelligibility are mutually exclusive. The agent intellect, then, cannot actualise a potentiality that does not, and cannot, take place. The analogy with light does not help to clarify the true nature of abstrac -tion and intelligibility:\n\nBut to say that the intellect throws rays and illuminates is void, false, and said by the ignorant. Moreover, no matter how many rays the light threw, colour would never be abstracted from the true being it has in the object if it did not have intentional being. Therefore, in a similar way no matter how many rays the intellect should irradiate over the imagined inten -tions, the intentions are never abstracted through irradiation.55\n\nVision is possible because colour is potentially visible, that is, it has the capac -ity to multiply itself in the transparent under intentional being, a capacity that\n\n54 'Quidam […] imaginantur quod, ⟨sicut⟩ lumen propter sui irradiationem potentia colo -res facit actu colores, sic intellectus agens imaginatas intentiones existentes in organo phantasiae illustrando irradiat, et sic ipsas facit actu intelligibiles.' (Siger of Brabant, In tertium de An. , qu. 14, 49.)\n\n55 'Sed hoc nihil est, dictum intellectum irradiare et illuminare, immo falsum est et ab igno -rante  dictum.  Praeterea,  quantumcumque  lumen  colorem  irradiet,  tamen  numquam color  abstraheretur  quantum  ad  esse  verum  quod  habet  in  obiecto,  nisi  haberet  esse intentionale. Ergo similiter quantumcumque intellectus intentiones imaginatas irradiet, numquam tamen abstrahuntur per irradiationem.' (Siger of Brabant, In tertium de An. , qu. 14, 49.)\n\nlight actualises. But an essence in a material substrate, be it external matter or a material organ, is not intelligible, not even potentially, and hence the agent intellect's action upon the sensory representation cannot bring about actual intelligibility.\n\nConsequently,  for  Siger,  abstraction  is  the  production  of  an  intelligible object  (the ratio  intelligendi  universalis )  by  the  intellect  itself  through  its productive power; an object similar to, but ontologically different from, the material essence:\n\n[…]  when  the  imagined  intentions  are  present  in  the  organ  of  the phantasy, the agent intellect produces universal intentions [similar] to the imagined intentions, and from these similar intentions it abstracts universal  notions  for  the  intellection  of  things.  Whence,  it  produces for itself universal notions for the intellection of things, not by making the  imagined  intentions  in  the  organ  of  the  phantasy  end  up  in  the possible intellect, but by producing for itself, and informing itself with, intentions similar to the imagined particular intentions, and from them it abstracts the universal notions for the intellection of things.56\n\nThe intellect, then, produces for itself, and informs itself with, an intelligible object that is similar to the material essence (or the imagined intention qua representation of the essence), but not identical with it - an immanent object. Siger says nothing more about the similarity in question. Intellection, in turn, amounts to the apprehension of such an object; an apprehension efficiently caused by the object itself.57 As a consequence, intellection has a causal rela -tion to an immanent object similar to the material essence.\n\nIn  Siger's  account,  the  unexplained  relation  of  similarity  between  the immanent  object  and  the  material  essence  jeopardises  the  possibility  of intellection being the basis of knowledge. Siger does not say much about the\n\n56 '[…] praesentibus imaginatis intentionibus in organo phantasiae, facit intellectus agens intentiones  universales  ⟨similes  ( my  correction )⟩  intentionibus  imaginatis,  et  ab  illis intentionibus similibus abstrahit rationes rerum intelligendi universales. Unde facit sibi rationes rerum intelligendi universales, non per hoc quod faciat intentiones imaginatae ab organo phantasiae resultare in intellectum possibilem, sed quia facit sibi et informat intentiones sibi similes intentionibus particularibus imaginatis, et ab illis abstrahit ratio -nes intelligendi rerum universales.' (Siger of Brabant, In tertium de An. , qu. 14, 50.)\n\n57 See Siger of Brabant, In tertium de An. , qu. 18, 68-69: 'Similiter forma immaterialis cogni -tionem sui obiecti facit secundum quod est similitudo obiecti […]. Unde nota quod duplex est universale: quoddam est universale quod est intentio pura universalis abstracta, non praedicabilis de particularibus extra; aliud est universale quod non est intentio pura, sed est forma realis, existens in pluribus, praedicabilis de eisdem. Nota ergo quod universale quod est intentio universalis pura facit cognitionem universalis realis.'\n\nsimilarity  between  the  immanent  object  and  the  material  essence,  but  this much is clear: similarity does not sufficiently ground nonaccidentally correct knowledge. Take, for instance, two phenomenologically identical immanent objects D and D*, one of which was produced using the material essence dog as a model and the other made up in some other way (for instance, as the notion of the chimera is made however it is). Suppose also that John has intellection caused by D and Peter has intellection caused by D*. Suppose further that both John and Peter claim to know that dogs bark .  Similarity does not sufficiently explain why John has a case of knowledge about a mind-independent fact and Peter a case of epistemic luck because similarity is not an asymmetric depen -dence relation between the immanent object and the material essence so as to sufficiently explain why the immanent object is derived from the material essence and not the other way around. As we shall see, similar concerns drive Radulphus Brito's rejection of accounts of intellection such as Siger's.\n\n## 6 Radulphus Brito\n\nLike Siger, Brito rejects Albert's innate cognition of first principles.58 But Brito also rejects any account of intellection according to which the first object of intellection  is  an  immanent  object.59  His  main  motivation  is  to  uphold  the\n\n58 '[…]  intelligere  nostrum  dependet  ex  sensatis  et  imaginatis.

Et hoc probant […]. Item, quod patitur patitur a suo simili. Sed isti conceptus sunt magis similes intellectui quam quod quid est, quia sunt immateriales sicut intellectus. Ergo etc.' (Radulphus Brito, In tertium de An ., qu. 7, 175.)\n\npossibility of scientific knowledge about the external world, hence his reiter -ated claim that the first object of intellection is the essence itself.60 Brito is, however, aware of the challenge that intellection presents because of the meta -physical incompatibility between the intellect and material essences. In the question 'Whether intellection is a sort of affection,' he sets out to engage the challenge with an account of intellection that aims to preserve both the passiv -ity of the possible intellect and a direct cognitive access to material essences.\n\nIn line with the Aristotelian tradition, Brito holds that intellection is a sort of affection. But affection is of two kinds: first, there is alteration, which is an affection in the strict sense, and in which a form is removed and its contrary received. For instance, heating is an affection in the strict sense because, under the action of the heating agent, the heated thing gradually loses the form of coldness and receives that of heat. Second, there is pure reception, in which, under  the  action  of  an  agent,  there  is  only  the  actualisation  of  a  potency without alteration.61 It is noteworthy that the textual witnesses to Brito's com -mentary on De anima transmit two different qualifications of reception: while in  most  manuscripts  reception  is  qualified  as  an  affection  in  a  wide  sense ( largo modo ), in the manuscript in London 62 (= L) it is qualified as an affection in  an  improper  sense  ( improprie ),  which  would  amount  to  strict  equivoca -tion. L, then, has a reading of the second sense of affection that is closer to Albert's understanding of it, according to which reception is an affection only in an equivocal sense. As we shall see, however, Brito wants to stay closer to a position that the material essence in the sensory representation is the effi -cient cause of intellection so as to make the largo modo reading seem more appropriate.\n\nThe intellect is affected in the second, and not in the first, sense of affection, that is, not by undergoing alteration but only reception. It does not undergo alteration because\n\n60 'Dico quod illud quod primo intelligitur est quod quid est rei et non eius species […]. Quia illud intellectus intelligit quod de alio affirmat vel negat in oratione. Modo intellec -tus affirmat et negat ipsam rem de alia et non speciem rei quae est in anima. Quare etc.' (Radulphus Brito, In tertium de An. , qu. 7, 174.)\n\n61 '[…]  duplex  est  passio,  sicut  Philosophus  distinguit,  quia  quaedam  est  passio  proprie dicta, quae est cum abiectione formae contrariae et per mutuam actionem contrarium ad invicem. Alia est passio largo modo [improprie L] dicta, quae est receptio perfectionis ab altero actu ente.' (Radulphus Brito, In tertium de An ., qu. 2, 121.)\n\n62 MS London, British Museum, Arundel 4, fol. 1 r -16v.\n\n[…] those things that are affected and act in the first sense have material contact ( communicant in materia ). But the intellect and the intelligible thing do not have material contact, because the intellect is unmixed and immaterial. Therefore, there is no affection properly speaking in it.63\n\nSo, the immateriality of the intellect prevents it from having material contact, and  hence  from  undergoing  alteration.  But  it  undergoes  reception  because '[…] that which has a receptive potency of some form or perfection is passive according to the affection which is the reception of the perfection; but the intellect is such […].'64 So, it undergoes reception in the sense that it is actual -ised by something other than itself. The question becomes, then, by what is it actualised? Brito provides a clear answer later in his commentary, but already here, in his reply to the counterarguments, he hints at his position:\n\n[…]  the  object  of  the  intellect  is  the  essence  ( quod  quid  est )  which exists outside joined to particulars. But it transforms the  intellect,  and is  an  object  of  the  intellect,  only  through  the  action  and  abstraction of the agent intellect […]. Also, the agent intellect, which, together with the phantasm , is the agent of intellection, is something real […].65\n\nHere, then, the essence in the sensory representation and the agent intellect are proposed as efficient co-causes of  intellection. Later, in question twelve, Brito makes clear that the agent intellect cannot be the only efficient cause of intellection. Otherwise, given that the agent intellect is naturally joined to the possible intellect, we would have intellection all the time, which is not the case. Therefore, the sensory representation, or rather the essence in it, must also play an efficient role in provoking intellection:\n\n63 '[…] illa quae patiuntur primo modo et agunt communicant in materia. Sed intellectus et intelligibile non communicant in materia, quia intellectus est immixtus et immaterialis. Ergo illi non est passio proprie dicta.' (Radulphus Brito, In tertium de An ., qu. 2, 121-22.)\n\n64 'Quia illud quod habet potentiam receptivam alicuius formae seu perfectionis est pas -sivum  passione  quae  est  receptio  perfectionis.  Sed  intellectus  est  huiusmodi […].' (Radulphus Brito, In tertium de An ., qu. 2, 121.) (L: '[…] quod intellectus sit passivus passio improprie dicta: Quod illud quod habet potentiam receptivam alicuius formae est recep -tivum passione improprie dicta.')\n\n65 '[…] quod quid est extra coniunctum cum particularibus est obiectum intellectus. Sed tamen  actu  non  immutat  intellectum  neque  obicitur  intellectui  nisi  per  actionem  et abstractionem intellectus agentis […]. Item, intellectus agens qui est agens intellectio -nem una⟨m (?)⟩ cum phantasmate, est aliquid reale […].' (Radulphus Brito, In tertium de An. , qu. 2, 126; my italics.)\n\nBut it must be understood that the agent intellect does not sufficiently lead  the  intellect  from  potency  to  act.  Rather,  a  phantasm  is  required with it, which by virtue of the agent intellect moves the possible intellect. Because if the agent intellect sufficiently led the possible intellect from potency to act, our intellect would have intellection all the time, since the agent intellect is always joined to the possible intellect.66\n\nThe material essence in the sensory representation sets in motion the possible intellect  thanks to the action of the agent intellect. But, how can the agent intellect give the material essence the capacity to set in motion an immaterial power? To see this, we must turn to question sixteen, where Brito explains the exact roles of the agent intellect and of the essence in the sensory representa -tion in intellection.\n\nQuestion  sixteen  concerns  the  mechanism  of  abstraction67  by  means  of which the agent intellect makes intelligible the material essence in the sensory representation.  Brito,  like  Siger,  rejects  the  accounts  of  abstraction  accord -ing to which the role of the agent intellect is to provide the material essence with intelligibility because whatever is received in a material substrate will be individual, and hence nonintelligible.  However, Brito parts ways with Siger in that he holds the material essence to be potentially intelligible. The mate -rial essence is not actually intelligible only because in material substrates it co-exists with accidents such as colour, magnitude, and so forth. Accordingly, for Brito, Aristotle's comparison of the role of the productive intellect in intel -lection  to  that  of  light  in  vision  is  revealing,  because  as  light  actualises  the visibility  of  the  colour,  the  agent  intellect  actualises  the  intelligibility  of the material essence. Intelligibility is an active power of the material essence. Once this power is actualised, the material essence can produce intellection:\n\n66 'Sed  intelligendum  est  quod  intellectus  agens  non  sufficienter  reducit  intellectum  de potentia ad actum. Sed requiritur cum hoc phantasma quod in virtute intellectus agentis movet intellectum possibilem. Quia si intellectus agens sufficienter reduceret intellectum possibilem de potentia ad actum, cum intellectus agens sit semper coniunctus cum intel -lectu possibili, tunc intellectus noster semper intelligeret.' (Radulphus Brito, In tertium de An. , qu. 12, 199-200.)\n\n67 For abstraction, see Ana María Mora-Má rquez, 'La contribution de Raoul le Breton à la discussion médié vale sur le caract è re passif ou actif de l'intellection,' in Miroir de l'amitié: Mélanges offerts à Joël Biard , ed. C. Grellard (Paris: Vrin, 2017), 177-92; and Mary Sirridge, 'The  Universal  Living  Thing  is  either  Nothing  or  Posterior,'  in Mind,  Cognition  and Representation: The Tradition of Commentaries on Aristotle's De anima , ed. P. J. M. M. Bakker and J. M. M. H. Thijssen (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2007), 45-68.\n\n'[…] the phantasms do not have intelligibility as a passive potency, but as an active potency to be apprehended because they actively produce intellection.'68 Brito points, then, to a cocausality between the essence in the sensory rep -resentation and the agent intellect in the process of intellection:\n\n[…] owing to the virtual contact between the light of the agent intellect and the phantasm, and to the co-assistance of this light with the phan -tasms, the quiddity that was in the phantasms with accidental notions can in itself move or transform the intellect without the accidents and the  particular  conditions  under  which  it  was  in  the  phantasy  being cognised.69\n\nIn this process, however, the material essence in the sensory representation seems to be the foremost efficient cause of intellection. Brito takes abstraction to be, in an almost literal sense, the illumination by the agent intellect of only the essence in the sensory representation. Through the act of abstraction, the material essence becomes actually intelligible, just as the whiteness of milk, but not its sweetness, becomes actually visible under the action of light. In other words, the agent intellect makes the essence in the sensory representa -tion actually capable of producing the act of intellection:\n\n[…] in relation to the phantasms the agent intellect, owing to a certain separation of the quiddity from the particular and material conditions (not real but according to the way of transforming), makes them capable of  immaterially  transforming  or  moving  the  possible  intellect  so  that the  quiddity  in  the  phantasy  produces  a  determined  cognition  in  the intellect.70\n\n68 '[…]  phantasmata  non  sunt  in  potentia  passiva  respectu  intelligibilitatis  sed  sunt  in potentia activa ad intelligi quia faciunt active intellectionem.' (Radulphus Brito, In tertium de An. , qu. 16, 242.)\n\n69 '[…] ex contactu virtuali luminis intellectus agentis ad phantasmata et ex coassistentia istius luminis cum phantasmatibus quidditas quae erat in phantasmatibus sub ratione accidentium  potest  movere  seu  immutare  intellectum secundum se praeter  hoc  quod accidentia  et  condiciones  particulares  sub  quibus  erat  in  phantasia  cognoscantur.' (Radulphus Brito, In tertium de An. , qu. 16, 236; my italics.)\n\n70 '[…] intellectus agens circa phantasmata facit quod ipsa ex quadam separatione quid -ditatis a conditionibus particularibus et materialibus non realiter sed secundum modum immutandi  possunt  intellectum  possibilem  immaterialiter  immutare  seu  movere  ita quod quidditas phantastica facit in intellectu determinatam cognitionem.' (Radulphus Brito, In  tertium  de  An. ,  qu.  16,  239-40.)  Cf.:  '[…] respectu  intellectus  possibilis  facit\n\nIntellection is, thus, primarily caused by the material essence even though this essence is made an actual cause by the agent intellect.\n\nTo sum up, intellection is, for Brito, the reception of a material essence in the intellect, where reception is understood as the actualisation of a potency by an agent other than the receiving thing. In intellection, this agent is the material essence under the light of the agent intellect.71 The relation between intellection and the material essence is, therefore, one of causation; a causation enabled by the agent intellect,72 which Brito considers an efficient co-cause .\n\nBrito's  account  has  an  edge  on  Siger's  in  that  in  the  former  intellection is,  through causation, directly73 and  nonaccidentally linked to the material essence, so as to be a good basis for knowledge about the material world.74 But does Brito meet all the criteria of MICI? Not quite, because it contains an explanatory gap, for the act of abstraction that makes the essence caus -ally efficient with respect to intellection is not sufficiently accounted for. It is explained only metaphorically as an illumination of sorts. Consequently, Brito fails to meet MICI because it remains mysterious how the agent intellect can help the material essence get rid of its metaphysical hindrance to be the effi -cient cause of intellectual acts.\n\nformam positive  et  immaterialiter  a  quidditate  phantastica  generari  […]  in  intellectu phantasmata generent determinatam cognitionem rei cuius sunt phantasmata.' (Ibid., qu. 16, 240.)\n\n71 'Secundo dicendum est quod intellectus possibilis intelligit per abstractionem a phantas -matibus, id est intelligendo quidditatem rei, non intelligendo accidentia vel conditiones particulares et materiales sub quibus existit in phantasia.' (Radulphus Brito, In tertium de An. , qu. 22, 269.) For Brito, the intelligible species is the act of intellection. He thus rejects a position often attributed to Aquinas, according to which the intelligible species is the efficient cause of intellection: '[…] dicendum quod species quae dicitur esse in anima non est aliud quam cognitio rei. Et hoc potest probari per rationes prius dictas.' (Ibid., qu. 24, 288.)\n\n72 '[…] phantasmata secundum se et in virtute propria non agunt in intellectum possibilem sed in virtute intellectus agentis et sub esse immateriali et abstracto.' (Radulphus Brito, In tertium de An. , qu. 22, 271.)\n\n73 '[…] dico quod illud quod intelligitur de se est quidditas rei secundum se cui accidit et esse signatum et esse abstractum. Tamen intelligitur sub esse quod habet in anima ita quod illud esse quod habet in anima non est illud quod intelligitur sed illud sub quo res intelligitur.' (Radulphus Brito, In tertium de An. , qu. 7, 176.)\n\n- 74 '[…] talis intellectus non est fictus quia quidditas et natura rei prior est quam conditiones individuales et ideo nata est cognosci non cognoscendo illas conditiones.' (Radulphus Brito, In tertium de An. , qu. 22, 269.)\n\n## 7 Conclusion\n\n## In the first part of this chapter I formulated MICI as:\n\nThe challenge to account for intellection by means of a (a) non-cognitive / non-epistemic ,  (b) plausible,  and  (c) positive  link  between  intellection and essences that (d) makes intellection a good basis for nonaccidental knowledge about them.\n\nAlbert, Siger, and Brito succeed in meeting (a) and (c): they all posit relations between intellection and its object (determination in Albert and causation in Siger and Brito) that are (a) non-cognitive / non-epistemic and (c) positive. As we have seen, Siger fails to meet (d), because the relation of similarity between the  immanent  object,  which  directly  causes  intellection,  and  the  material essence jeopardises intellection's ability to be the basis of true knowledge. In order to meet (d), Brito rejects accounts such as Siger's, which introduce inter -mediate objects of intellection. But Brito leaves a gap as regards (b), for he posits a relation of causation, made possible by the agent intellect, between intellec -tion and the material essence, but does not explain sufficiently the mechanism whereby the agent intellect enables such a relation. Does Albert's account fare any better as regards MICI? Regarding (b), is determination a plausible relation between the immaterial and the material realms? If we understand it as akin to formal causation, as I have suggested, I think it is; for nothing prevents, say, the form of the table in the designer's mind from formally determining the material table in my living room, so determination between the immaterial and the material realms can indeed obtain. As I have shown, Albert's account also  meets  (d),  for,  through  determination,  intellection  of x is  ontologically dependent on x so as to be a good basis for nonaccidental knowledge of x . His account is also complete, insofar as the Aristotelian theoretical framework is concerned, for intellection continues to be a passive process, which in Albert's case is actualised by the act of abstraction and not by the object of intellection, as in Siger's and Brito's accounts.\n\nTo sum up, although Albert's, Siger's, and Brito's accounts are structurally similar in that they all understand concept formation as crucially composed of two distinct psychological processes - intellection and abstraction - the sub -tle but substantial differences between their accounts emerge clearly when we submit these accounts to the test of MICI.",
