Over the past fifty years, this debate has been framed in terms of the opposition between advocates of affirmative  action  who  claim  that  it  is  needed  in  order  to  achieve  the  integration  and participation  of  traditionally  oppressed  groups  to  society  without  which  there  is  no equality  of  rights,  and  critics  who  argue  that  affirmative  action  violates  equality  by enforcing a double standard that undermines the ideal of a color-blind society. In this paper,  I  show  how  the  basic  principles  of  DusselÕs  ethical  theory  (which  are  best expounded in his book Ethics of Liberation )  allow us to address what I take to be the main demands of both advocates and critics of affirmative action in a satisfactory way.\n\n## Resumen en espa-ol\n\nEste art'culo propone una aplicaci-n de la Žtica de la liberaci-n de Enrique Dussel a una  cuesti-n  de  importancia  crucial  para  las  minor'as  en  Estados  Unidos:  el  debate sobre  la  acci-n  afirmativa.

In virtue of this, Dussel has shown how ethics has been used often throughout  history  to  justify  some  cultural  or social  institutions  (such  as  slavery  or  colonialism),[1]  but  also  how  it  can  also  be employed to liberate individuals that have been oppressed by these institutions.\n\nIn  particular,  in  the  case  of  education,  Dussel  (1985,  12)  has  famously  argued that, although universities and other higher education institutions in ÔperipheryÕ countries functioned  as  Ôbrain-washing  theatersÕ  in  which  students  were  taught  to  repeat  and emulate fashionable trends of thought generated in European metropoles, the eventual recognition by some individuals in the ÔperipheryÕ of this role led them to question some key  assumptions  underlying  this  educational  model,  thus  yielding  a  dismantlement  of some  social  structures  that  fostered  oppression.  In  particular,  in  the  case  of  Freire, Dussel (2013, 312) remarks that his pedagogical views constitute a departure from a traditional  notion  of  education  because  Òwithout  losing  sight  of  [the  importance  of theoretical or moral intelligence], Freire aims, first and foremost, to educate the victims in the very historical, communitarian and real process through which they abandon their condition  as  victims.Ó  Indeed,  as  Freire  (1970)  suggests  rethinking  the  philosophical assumptions  underlying  traditional  pedagogy  to  promote  in  students  a  critical  and transformative  activity  geared  towards  their  intellectual  emancipation,  his  pedagogical proposal can be considered as a clear expression of one of the main desiderata of the philosophy of liberation which, as Dussel (1985, 173) maintains, is Ôto think what has never been thought before: the process of the liberation of dependent and peripheral countriesÕ.\n\nNow, even if there have been many successful applications of the central ideas that underpin philosophy of liberation in peripheral countries in the last forty years (for instance,  in  the  case  of  the  use  of  FreireÕs  ideas  to  design  and  implement  literacy campaigns),[2]  the  philosophical  project  put  forth  by  Dussel  still  leaves  many  issues open.  Let me  illustrate this with an  example.  Even  though  Dussel  (2013,  47) characterizes  his  project  as  Ôa  critical  philosophy  born  in  the  periphery  (from  the perspective of the victims), which has the intention of being relevant on a global scaleÕ, there has been so far relatively little work done on how DusselÕs ethics of liberation can\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n!\n\nbe applied to address the causes of disenfranchisement that afflict different oppressed and marginalized groups residing in ÔcenterÕ countries such as the US.[3] My goal in this paper is to articulate and defend a potential application of DusselÕs ethics of liberation to address  a  contentious  issue  in  the  US:  the  access  of  historically  vulnerable  and marginalized groups in the US to higher education through affirmative action.\n\nI  will  proceed  in  the  following  way.  In  the  second  section  of  the  paper,  I  will present  very  succinctly  the  traditional  debate  between  advocates  and  opponents  of affirmative action policy in regards to the access of traditionally marginalized students to higher education, highlighting one major limitation that underpins the debate. In the third section, I will rehearse and discuss briefly what I take to be the three core principles of DusselÕs ethics of liberation Ðnamely, the material principle, the formal principle and the feasibility  principleÐ  and  I  will  show  how  these  principles  relate  to  each  other.  In  the fourth section, I will show how these principles provide a framework that enables us to address the issue of affirmative action in regards to access to higher education in a way that bypasses the limitations of the traditional debate. Finally, in the last section, I will provide a brief conclusion.\n\n## I. The Traditional Debate\n\nIn order to understand the traditional debate between advocates and opponents of affirmative action, it is first crucial to understand what affirmative action consists of. Although there are many different characterizations of the concept, I will take as a point of  reference  the  following  definition  (Fullinwider  2013):  ÒÔAffirmative  actionÕ  means positive steps taken to increase the representation of women and minorities in areas of employment, education, and culture from which they have been historically excluded.Ó It is important to observe that this characterization is different from the way in which the notion of affirmative action was presented in one of the first official documents in which it is used:\n\nThe contractor will not discriminate against any employee or applicant because of race, creed, color, or national origin. The contractor will take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment  without  regard  to their race, creed, color or national origin. (Executive Order 10925, sec. 301)\n\nAs we can appreciate, although the original intent of the affirmative action was to eliminate discrimination with vis-ˆ-vis persons employed by federal contractors on the basis  of  certain  features  such  as  race  or  national  origin  (which  is  a  goal  that  is consistent with both the letter and the spirit of the US Constitution, in particular with the 14th amendment), the notion of affirmative action that Fullinwinder presents is far more substantial (and potentially more  controversial) since it involves not only the enforcement of the negative right of individuals not to be discriminated as members of certain groups in areas such as education or employment but also the enforcement of a\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n!\n\npositive right to a larger representation in these areas to ensure genuine integration and participation  Ða  right  that  has  been  typically  enforced  through  the  implementation  of preferential  selections  for  certain  individuals  in  regards  to  access  to  education  or employment on the basis of their being members of certain groups.[4]\n\nThis process of preferential selection, which has been implemented in some way or another by many American universities, has generated a deep controversy in the last five decades. Two of the crucial questions that have driven the debate are the following ones:  why  should  we  give  preference  to  certain  individuals  (in  particular,  regarding access to higher education) based on their belonging to a certain group? Are there good reasons to offer to some individuals access to higher education institutions over others that  may  be  as  equally  qualified  as  the  preferred  ones?  Several  philosophers  have articulated  and  critically  assessed  during  the  last  four  decades  different  responses  to these questions. For instance, some have contended that affirmative action is justified because  certain  minority  groups  (e.g.,  Blacks)  have  been  discriminated de  jure until very recently in comparison to other groups which still enjoy unearned advantages. On the basis of this, some authors have then argued that the use of affirmative action is justified  in  decisions  about  access  to  higher  education  because  it  provides  a  path  to equality  by redressing past  wrongs  (Thomson  1973)  and/or  by neutralizing  unearned advantages enjoyed by privileged groups (Rachels 1979).\n\nIn virtue of this, it is patent that some defenses of affirmative action have been supported  by  arguments  that  rely  on  notions  of  justice  and  desert.  But  this  is troublesome for advocates of affirmative action because critics have in many occasions developed arguments opposing affirmative action that also rely on these very notions of justice and desert. For instance, Goldman (1976, 191) has argued that Ôit seems unjust for  a  society  to  set  standards  of  achievement  and  then  to  thwart  the  expectations  of those who have met those standardsÕ. And, in a parallel fashion, Sher has contended that,  in  the  case  of  individuals  who  were  not  able  to  succeed  in  school  because  of material or other privations, it is the case that:\n\n- ( … )  reverse  discrimination  to  restore  precisely  the  competitive  position  that  a person would have had if he had not been prevented from working would not be desirable  [because]  actual  effort  creates  desert  in  a  way  that  merely  possible effort does not. (1975, 166)\n\nIn  fact,  the  panorama  is  more  somber  for  supporters  of  affirmative  action.  Not only have their adversaries mounted counter-arguments based on the very notions they invoke to justify affirmative action, but it seems to be the case that affirmative action is an  inconsistent  or  self-undermining  policy  because,  in  spite  of  the  fact  that  it  was embraced by the civil rights movement in the late 1960Õs to further some of its key goals (e.g.,  achieving a color-blind society with equal rights and equal opportunity for all its members), it allegedly undermines those very goals:\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n!\n\nThe civil rights movement (...) should turn its attention back to its first principles Ð the zealous regard for equal opportunity and the promotion of color-blind law and social  policyÐ  and  away  from  color  conscious  remedies  that  abandon  principle and lead us further away from a society free of the bane of racial discrimination. (Abram 1986, 1312)\n\nThis objection is particularly trenchant because it rests on a key principle that is enshrined in the fourteenth amendment, which is that of equality of all before the law.[5] This principle  is  so  deeply  ingrained  in  the American  judicial  system  that  courts  have upheld several challenges to affirmative action in access to higher education ( Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, Hopwood v. Texas and Schuette v. Coalition to defend affirmative action )  by  appealing  to  this  principle,  though  they  have  upheld  the validity  of  the  use  of  affirmative  action  to  further  diversity,  which  is  recognized  as  a Ôcompelling state interestÕ as long as its use is Ônarrowly tailoredÕ ( Grutter v. Bollinger ). In virtue of this, it seems that one cannot mount a solid case for affirmative action based on equality considerations because the principle of equality of all before the law cuts both ways.[6] On one side, it can be used to argue persuasively for affirmative action on the basis that equality requires the full integration and participation of minority groups that have been traditionally excluded via a preferential treatment. On the other side, it can be also used to argue against affirmative action on the basis that the use of different standards for different groups perpetuates a color-conscious society in which minorities are often stigmatized.\n\nAs we can appreciate, the debate on affirmative action has essentially revolved around the concepts of equality, justice, desert and diversity in the last five decades, and a substantial  number  of  authors  have  made  attempts  to  find  a  balance  between competing  demands.  In  particular,  the  vast  majority  of  the  legal  and  philosophical literature  on  affirmative  action  has  addressed  a  version  of  at  least  one  of  the  two following questions to either defend or criticize its use: (a) is there a way to justify and preserve the use of affirmative action in a way that does not involve either infringing on justice and/or upsetting desert and (b) does the right of individuals to equal treatment trump the stateÕs compelling interest to promote diversity?\n\nDespite the importance of these two questions, I believe that a sustained focus on  them  has  blinded  us  to  a  point  clearly  made  by  Justice  OÕConnor  in  the  majority opinion written for Grutter : ÔRace-conscious admission policies must be limited in time. ( … ) Enshrining  a  permanent  justification  for  racial  preferences  would  offend  this fundamental equal protection principle.Õ As the majority of court made clear, affirmative action understood as a set of preferential policies meant to enforce a positive right of certain communities to a larger representation was never intended to be permanent and is solely justified as a temporary relief measure. But this in turn raises a question: what should we do to avoid turning affirmative action into a perennial policy while being true to the ideals of equality and justice that initially motivated it? The lack of interest on this question, which has not been addressed in the legal or philosophical literature to the best of my knowledge, constitutes a limitation of the way in which the debate has been\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n!\n\nframed. Now, I believe that DusselÕs ethics of liberation provides us with a potentially interesting way to address this question. However, prior to showing how DusselÕs ethical system can be applied to this issue, it is important to be clear on the key principles that underly DusselÕs theory, so I will present them in the next section.\n\n## II. DusselÕs Ethics of Liberation\n\nAlthough DusselÕs ethics of liberation is an incredibly rich and complex view that enables  us  to  account  for  various  issues  that  traditional  moral  theories  also  address such as the subjugation of women, it can be characterized as being underpinned by a key insight. For Dussel (2013, 55), an ethics of liberation Ôunfolds in its own way from the  exercise  of  an  ethical  critique,  where  the  negated  dignity  of  the  life  of  the  victim, oppressed or excluded, is affirmed.Õ As this citation makes clear, the crucial insight on which an ethics of liberation rests is a concern for all those who are most oppressed or marginalized in any society. This idea is clearly captured in one of the key principles that lies at the heart of DusselÕs ethics, which he calls the material principle :\n\nThe  one  who  acts  ethically  ought  to  produce,  reproduce  and  develop  selfresponsibly the concrete life of each human subject, in a community of life, and inevitably out of a cultural and historical good life (...) that is shared instinctually and solidaristically. (2013, 104)\n\nAs we can see, the material principle, which states that ethical actions are those geared towards the development of all human lives (particularly, of those who are most oppressed or marginalized) rests on the value of solidarity . In virtue of this, in order to apply the material principle, we are required to do the following: (a) we must first identify those individuals who are the most oppressed or marginalized in a given social system and (b) we must address subsequently from their perspective why the social system in question fails them (i.e., why it oppresses them and marginalizes them). Consequently, the material principle grounds all ethical action on the recognition and vindication of the lives of those who make up the underside of society.\n\nDussel  stresses  in  many  places  that,  to  be  genuine,  the  application  of  the material principle must be accompanied not by a reform of political or social institutions (which is a change that leaves intact the structural conditions of oppression), but rather by:\n\n- (...)  transforming  action  [which],  by  contrast,  judges  and  modifies  the  formal system from the life and the responsible discursiveness of any human subject, and, as the ultimate reference, of the victims. (2013, 395)\n\nFor Dussel, this transforming action is often carried by social justice movements (such as the civil rights movement in the US or the Zapatista Army of National Liberation in  Mexico),  which are manifestations of anti-hegemonic forces. These anti-hegemonic forces  are  crucial  for  Dussel  because  they  function  according  to  him  as  catalysts  of\n\nInter-American Journal of Philosophy\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n!\n\nÔanalectic momentsÕ where we identify with and affirm the lives of the oppressed. In the case of education, these anti-hegemonic forces, which have been at play for Dussel for decades, have helped to create at certain moments a critical consensus, such as the one  that  allowed  in  1995  students  but  also  families,  churches  and  even  whole communities to rally against Proposition 187.[7] Now, in doing so, these anti-hegemonic forces operate in accordance with the second key principle of DusselÕs ethics, which he calls the formal principle and expresses in the following way:\n\nThere  is  critical  validity  in  the  community  when  the  excluded  victims,  having recognized  each  other  as  distinct  from  the  oppressive  system,  symmetrically participate  in  the  agreements  about  what  affects  them  while  at  the  same  time sustaining  that  critical  consensus  is  grounded  in  rational  argumentation  and motivated by the drive of co-solidarity. (2013, 345)\n\nThis clearly shows that the formal principle is motivated by solidarity with those who are most oppressed, but its goal is the inclusion of oppressed victims as symmetric or equal participants in a transformative process that is based  on rational argumentation. In virtue of this, the formal principle aims to achieve an ideal of equality. Now, Dussel does not consider equality as an abstract value that is given to us from the start (as in RawlsÕ view of justice as fairness). Rather, equality is an achievement that emerges as the result of the progressive inclusion of those who are oppressed and the transformation  of  the  political  system.  And,  since  this  change  or  transformation  is progressive, it is subject to several important constrains, which are taken into account by the third and last principle of DusselÕs ethics, which he calls the feasibility principle and expresses as follows:\n\n- [ … ]  who proposes to carry out or transform a norm, act, institution, and so on, cannot  leave  out  of  consideration  the  conditions  of  possibility  of  its  objective, material and formal, empirical, technical, economic, political, and so on fulfillment, such that the act will be possible taking into account the laws of nature in general, and human laws in particular. (2003, 188)\n\nThis principle of feasibility articulates a notion of positive liberty Ði.e., liberty that we have to transform things in accordance with certain constrains that are imposed on us both by natural and human laws, and by the goals of the two other principles (the material  principle  and  the  formal  principle).  Thus,  in  a  nutshell,  DusselÕs  ethics  of liberation can be described or characterized as follows:\n\n- (A) It is an ethical system which values at its core solidarity with those who are most oppressed in society.\n- (B) It is an ethical system which stresses that the only genuine way to manifest solidarity  is  through  a  political  transformation  (not  a  reform)  of  social  and economic structures to include the oppressed as equal participants.\n- (C) It is an ethical system in which political transformation is constrained by our capacity or liberty  to  act  without  violating  either  natural  or  human  laws,  or  any prior commitments to solidarity and equality.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n!\n\nThough there is far more to be said on how the three aforementioned principles are related to each other and how they are articulated by Dussel to develop a full blown ethical theory,[8] I will limit myself here to what I have presented above, which are the bare bones of his proposal. Indeed, my goal here is not to present in great detail an analysis of DusselÕs ethical proposal to evaluate both its advantages and shortcomings vis-ˆ-vis  other  ethical  views  (for  instance,  utilitarianism),  but  rather  just  to  suggest  a potential  application  of  DusselÕs  overall  view  to  the  problem  raised  at  the  end  of  the second section of this paper, and I will do this in the following section.\n\n## III.  An Application of DusselÕs Ethics of Liberation\n\nAs I mentioned previously, though the debate on affirmative action in regards to access to higher education has been remarkably enriching over the last fifty years, it has  suffered  from  one  serious  limitation,  which  is  the  failure  to  address  the  point stressed  by  OÕConnor  when  she  penned  the  majority  opinion  in Bollinger .  How  can DusselÕs ethics of liberation help us to avoid turning affirmative action into a perennial policy  while  nonetheless  staying  true  to  the  ideals  of  equality  and  justice  that  initially motivated it? Here is my suggestion. Given the distinction between political reform and political  transformation  introduced  by  Dussel,[9]  one  may  argue  along  the  following lines.\n\nAlthough the initial goals of affirmative action in higher education Ði.e., achieving equality and promoting diversityÐ are good and praiseworthy, affirmative action is flawed because it is a reformist policy that leaves intact the structural conditions that generate discrimination  and  oppression.  Moreover,  as  a  reformist  policy  that  was  implemented along a Ôtop-downÕ line by a series of Executive Orders or legislative decisions rather than by a Ôbottom-upÕ anti-hegemonic movement, affirmative action is a product of an unjust and corrupt political and economic system, so it is not surprising that it often has perverse consequences, as the following story illustrates:\n\nThe case of a young man who was a high school classmate of my daughters is also  instructive.  ( … )  he  was  a  mature  pleasant  fellow,  although  he  was  not particularly bright, a fact reflected by his grades in high school. ( … ) But he had the good fortune of having had a Mexican American great-grandmother. He had no other connection to the Latino community. ( … ) The only living connection he had to anything Latino was through his friendship with my daughter. ( … ) When it came  to  applying  for  college,  however,  this  young  man,  on  the  advice  of  his parents,  applied  to  one  of  the  premier  universities  in  the  nation  and  he  got  in. (Gracia 2008, 97)\n\nIn virtue of this, one possible solution (along roughly Dusselian lines) would be the  following:  in  order  to  avoid  similar  cases,  rather  than  spending  time  and  effort  to assess  the  merits  of  all  potential  candidates  to  higher  education  who  claim  minority status to determine if they should benefit from affirmative action or not, we should strive to achieve a political transformation of our system grounded on solidarity with those who\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n!\n\nare most oppressed. The main rationale to undertake this, following Dussel, is that, in doing  so,  we  would  address  the  roots  of  the  oppression  and  discrimination  of marginalized  individuals  rather  than  its  consequences.  This  is  of  crucial  importance because, according to Dussel, the roots of this discrimination and oppression are not merely accidental features. Instead, they lie at the very core of the global political and economic  system,  the  actions  and  policies  of  which  are  inconsistent  with  what  it proclaims:\n\nThe utopian project of the prevailing world system, which is becoming globalized, is  revealed  as  being  in  contradiction  with  itself,  given  that  the  majority  of  its possible  participants  have  become  victims  deprived  of  the  ability  to  satisfy  the needs that this same system has proclaimed as rights. (2013, 217)\n\nConsidering this, I contend that applying DusselÕs ethics of liberation to the issue of affirmative action regarding the access to higher education provides us with a way to reconcile  what  I  take  to  be  the  crucial  demands  of  both  critics  and  advocates  of affirmative action. Indeed, on one side, adopting an ethics of liberation would enable us to concede that affirmative action is a limited and flawed policy that violates the ideal of color-blind equality and that yields often perverse results, as its critics maintain.[10] And, on the other side, adopting an ethics of liberation would enable us to justify and strive for  a  transformation  of  the  political  and  economic  system  in  which,  by  embracing solidarity towards  the  oppressed  victims  and  working  to  include  them  as  equal participants, we would achieve the goals of the civil rights movement (i.e., social peace and  social  justice),  which  is  what  advocates  of  affirmative  action  have  traditionally fought for.[11] Moreover, by adopting an ethics of liberation, I believe that we could in principle  transcend the debates regarding the impacts of affirmative action on justice, equality  and  desert,  by  focusing  on  a  more  basic  issue:  how  can  we  transform  the structural conditions which initially motivated affirmative action?\n\nThis question, which is of paramount importance, has been recognized as being more pressing than problems that stem from the implementation of affirmative action. In particular, Nagel has raised this issue in the following manner:\n\nWhen we try to deal with the inequality in advantages that results from a disparity in qualifications (however produced) between races and sexes, we are up again a  pervasive  feature  of  the  system  (...)  We  must  face  the  possibility  that  the primary injustice with which we have to contend lies in this feature itself, and that some of the worst aspects of what we now perceive as racial or sexual injustice are merely conspicuous manifestations of the great social injustice. (Nagel 1973, 353)\n\nHowever,  though  it  is  clear  that  Nagel  is  aware  that  both  racial  and  gender discrimination (which have been used to justify affirmative action) are likely rooted in a larger and  more  pervasive  feature  of  the  current  political and  economic  global system[12] he does not propose a feasible solution to tackle this great social injustice. In virtue of this, a more precise version of the above-mentioned question may be raised:\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n!\n\nwhat means can we actually employ at a concrete and practical level within the context of higher education to accomplish this worthy goal?[13] Though I cannot provide here, given space limitations, a full account of how a Dusselian ethics of liberation could be used to answer this question, I will make in the following lines a tentative suggestion that outlines a feasible course of action to challenge this great social injustice.\n\nOver a decade ago, several newspapers, businesses, faith organizations, school boards and higher education institutions in Colorado formed a coalition known as the Higher Education Access Alliance (HEAA) to support legislation that would offer in-state tuition for undocumented students.[14] Though there was considerable support from a large section of ColoradoÕs population for a tuition equity law (the ASSET bill) that would alleviate  the  situation  that  thousands  of  undocumented  students  residing  in  Colorado faced, many attempts to pass this legislation in the Colorado General Assembly failed. After the last failure in 2012, the President and the Board of Trustees of MSU Denver recognized that they were not compelled by law to establish for undocumented students that qualified as Colorado residents the same tuition rate set for out-of-state students and, consequently, they decided unilaterally to implement a nonresident unsubsidized tuition rate called the Colorado High School/GED  Non-resident tuition rate for undocumented  students.  This  tuition  rate,  though  higher  than  the  in-state  one,  was nevertheless  significantly  lower  than  the  out-of-state  rate.  In  doing  so,  MSU  Denver affirmed  its  solidarity  with  the  most  vulnerable  and  oppressed  group  belonging  to  its student population (i.e., undocumented students, who often had immigrated with their parents from Latin American countries as children and had extremely limited financial resources to pay for a college education) and made an earnest effort to include them as equal participants in a transformative process through a policy that did not offer them a positive preference (as affirmative action does) but that attempted to challenge directly the great injustice that they were subject to.\n\nIn virtue of this actual  example,  one  potential  course  of  action  that  both advocates and critics of affirmative action can then follow consists in working both within and outside institutions of higher education to emulate the actions of MSU Denver in other  states[15]  in  order  to  implement,  if  not  full  tuition-equity  for  undocumented students,  at  least  tuition  rates  that  are  significantly  lower  than  the  out-of-state  tuition rates.  This  course  of  action,  which  challenges  the  structural  injustice  that  afflicts  the most vulnerable and oppressed group of students, is consistent with DusselÕs principle of feasibility and also satisfies the material and formal principles.\n\n## IV.  Conclusion\n\nLet me recap. I have argued in this paper that DusselÕs ethics of liberation can be effectively used to tackle the debate on affirmative action regarding the access to higher education  in  the  US.  The  main  advantages  of  employing  such  a  method  are  the following ones: on the one side, it would enable us to satisfy Justice OÕConnorÕs point regarding the need to avoid turning affirmative action into a perennial policy and, on the\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nVolume 6, Issue 1, Page 10\n\n!\n\nother  side,  it  would  potentially  enable  us  to  satisfy  what  I  consider  to  be  the  main demands of both opponents and advocates of affirmative action. Indeed, adopting an ethics of liberation would enable us to concede that affirmative action violates the ideal of a color-blind law, to justify the need to transform the current political and economic system to eliminate the structural conditions that give rise to the discrimination of racial minorities in the US and to undertake certain actions that effectively address (at least in a partial way) the great social injustice that initially motivated affirmative action.\n\nSergio A.

See, for instance, AristotleÕs discussion of natural slavery in his Politics (1254b17-1255b39) and the use of his arguments by Juan GinŽs de Sepulveda in On the just causes of the war with  the  Indians to  justify  the  oppression  of  Indigenous  populations  in  the  American continent.\n- [2] For a recent discussion of the influence of FreireÕs pedagogical views on the development of literacy campaigns (particularly in Chile and Nicaragua), see Kirkendall (2010).\n- [3] A clarification is important here. Though a number of theologians based in the US  have  made  very  substantial  contributions  that  show  how  different  liberation theologies  can  have  a  profound  impact  on  oppressed  and  marginalized  groups  (e.g.,\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n!\n\nIsazi-D'az 2004, De la Torre 2004, De la Torre and Aponte 2006), there has been little work  on  how  DusselÕs  specific  writings  and,  in  particular,  his  ethical  views  bear  on issues  of  interest  to  oppressed  and  marginalized  groups  in  the  US.  Since  this  is  the project that I am pursuing in this paper, I will leave aside here the contribution of these other authors.\n\n[4] For further discussion on the distinction between negative and positive rights, see Narveson (2001).\n\n[5]  It  is  important  to  point  out  here  that  even  staunch  defenders  of  affirmative action tend to be sensitive to the line of argument according to which it violates equality. For instance, Ezorsky (1991, 82) acknowledges the following: ÔAccording to this claim, all whites deserve to pay the cost of preferential treatment (hereafter, the desert claim). I do not accept the desert claim; indeed, I suggest that the criticism of racial preference as unfair to adversely affected whites is not without merit.Õ\n\n- [6] I am in agreement with this position, which is defended by Warnke (1998).\n- [7] For further details on the popular reaction to Proposition 187, before and after its vote, see Ono and Sloop (2002).\n- [8]  For  further  discussion  concerning  the  three  principles  of  DusselÕs  ethics  of liberation, see Mendieta (1999) and Marsh (2000).\n- [9]  For  more  details  on  the  difference  and  opposition  between  reform  and transformation, see Dussel (2008, 111-112).\n\n[10] In addition to Abram, other opponents to affirmative action on the grounds that  it  violates  the  ideal  of  a  color-blind  society  include  Reynolds  (1996)  and  Welch (1996).  While  I  am  in  agreement  with  this  point,  the  solution  is  not  (as  some  people would  have)  to  eliminate  affirmative  action  by  pretending,  as  Patrick  (1996,  144) critically  observes,  that  Ôdiscrimination  is  not  still  with  us,  or  that  it  has  no  present widespread effects.Õ Rather, a better solution involves, as I argue below, transforming the political and economic system that motivates the need of affirmative action policies in the first place.\n\n[11] In particular, advocates of affirmative action such as Crosby and Herzberger (1996, 89) justify it by arguing that Ôto the extent that affirmative action arrests the trend toward bifurcated wealth in our nation, it contributes to economic and social stability.Õ\n\n[12] This feature, which lies in the contradictory nature of capitalism that destroys both the world and humanity (which are conditions of possibility of its own existence) as it  defeats  all  barriers,  is  characterized  by  Dussel  (2013,  39)  in  the  following  terms: ÔGiven that for Modernity nature is only a medium of production, nature fulfills its fate of being  consumed  and  destroyed.  In  addition  the  by-products  of  that  destruction accumulate on upon the Earth,  until  it  jeopardizes  the  reproduction  or  survival  of  life itself. Life is the absolute condition of capital; its destruction destroys capital.Õ\n\n[13] I thank an anonymous reviewer for pressing this question. What follows is an attempt  to  provide  a  partial  answer  to  it  that  is  consistent  with  DusselÕs  principle  of feasibility.\n\n[14]  For  more  details  on  this,  see  http://www.msudenver.edu/media/content/ presidentofficeof/6-20-12%20JBC%20Memo.pdf\n\n[15]  Colorado  passed  in  2013  along  with  three  other  states  (New  Jersey, Minnesota  and  Oregon)  legislation  that  guarantees  in-state  tuition  for  undocumented Inter-American Journal of Philosophy May , 2015\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n!\n\nstudents meeting certain eligibility criteria. However, over half of the states in the US do not currently have such legislation and some states have laws barring undocumented students from receiving in-state tuition rates or prohibiting them from enrolling in their public higher education institutions.\n\n## References\n\nAristotle.
