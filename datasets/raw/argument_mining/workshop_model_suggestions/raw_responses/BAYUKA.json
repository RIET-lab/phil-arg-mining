    "user_content": "## Eric Bayruns García\n\nPenultimate Draft forthcoming in the Inter-American Journal of Philosophy\n\nUnderstanding, Knowledge and the Valladolid Debate: Why Las Casas and Sepúlveda Differ on the Moral Status of Indigenous Persons\n\nIn the 16 th century, Friar Bartolomé de las Casas and Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda engaged in a philosophical debate that would bear on how Europeans  related to Indigenous, African and later Latinx American persons until the present day. This debate was the Valladolid debate. The Valladolid debate  was  commissioned  by  the  Spanish  Crown  in  response  to  the  Spanish-caused  Indigenous genocide which occurred during the 16 th century. This debate took the moral status and corresponding treatment  of  Indigenous  persons  in  the  Americas  as  its  locus  of  disagreement.  On  behalf  of  the apologists  of  this  genocide,  Sepúlveda  presented  specious  metaphysical  and  moral  arguments  to support the false view that Indigenous persons in the Americas were subpersons or natural slaves. These  conclusions  were  not  only  used  to  justify  this  genocide  of  up  to  100  million  Indigenous Americans in the century following Christopher Columbus' arrival in the Caribbean (Cave, 2008; Mills, 1997; Stannard, 1992), but they were also used to justify the enslavement of African persons in the Americas and then later the colonizing of Asia and Australia.\n\nConsideration of this debate raises the issue of how Sepúlveda could get so much wrong despite  the  facts  he  knew.  For  example,  Sepúlveda  knew  about  many  of  the  technological, organizational and architectural accomplishments of the Mexica and Maya people. Consideration of this debate also raises the issue of why las Casas more accurately represented reality in the Americas than Sepúlveda while still getting important things wrong. To address these issues, I will explore how Bartolomé de las Casas and Ginés de Sepúlveda's conclusions in the Valladolid debate relate to the epistemic states of knowledge and understanding. I will argue that las Casas and Sepúlveda differed in their conclusions regarding the status of Indigenous persons at least partly because las Casas had some, but not complete, understanding of Indigenous persons, culture and societies and Sepúlveda had mere knowledge of them.\n\nTo this end, I will show that the epistemic state of understanding explains why  las Casas properly concludes that Indigenous persons deserve the same moral status afforded to Europeans. And I will show how las Casas' understanding of Indigenous persons, culture and societies relat es to what he gets wrong about Indigenous persons. To show this, I will appeal to a minimal version of standpoint  theory  to  explain  why  las  Casas  largely  accurately  represents  Indigenous  peoples  and cultures, on the one hand, and why las Casas errs in certain respects vis-à-vis Indigenous peoples and cultures on the other hand.\n\nThis argument will also involve an explanation of how Sepúlveda's knowledge of Indigenous persons, culture and societies does not prevent him from arriving at a false conclusion about them that is inconsistent with this knowledge. To explain this, I will appeal to how the human psychological disposition to believe certain ways interacts with 16 th century elite Spaniards' positive self -conception.\n\n## Section I\n\nIn  this  section,  I  will  argue  that  las Casas  and  Sepúlveda's  different  experiences  vis -à-vis Indigenous  persons  explains  why  they  come  to  differ  in  terms  of  their  beliefs  regarding  the metaphysical and moral status of Indigenous persons.\n\nBartolomé de las Casas ' personal experience in the Americas in general and with Indigenous persons in particular starkly differs from Ginés de Sepúlveda's experience . Susana Nuccetelli points to  this  fact  when she  says,  ' Las Casas differed dramatically from Sepúlveda in that he had direct knowledge of these [Indigenous] peoples' (Nuccetelli, 2020, p. 5). Las Casas spent a large part of his life in the Americas in regions such as the Caribbean, Mesoamerica and South America (Deagan &amp; Cruxent, 2002; Gracia &amp; Millán, 2004; Las Casas, 1992b, 1992a; Nuccetelli, 2020). In these areas, he became familiar with Indigenous persons and the habits, customs and practices that made up their forms of life.\n\nIn contrast, Sepúlveda's experience with the Americas and its various Indigenous peoples such as the Taino, Caribe, Nahuatl and Mayan people was limited to reports that he received through firstpersonal testimony and, most often, written reports from Conquistadores, Spanish administrators and bureaucrats  (Nuccetelli,  2020).  I  submit  that  this  difference  in  experience  in  significant  measure explains why they differed in their epistemic attitudes towards the Indigenous peoples of the Americas.\n\nEven though Las Casas and Sepúlveda ultimately had divergent views about the metaphysical, and thus moral, status of the Americas' Indigenous peoples, they began with similarly false belie fs about the Indigenous persons of the Americas. When las Casas arrived in Santo Domingo with his father  on  Columbus'  second  voyage  to  the  Americas,  he  partook  in  the  common  and  immoral practices  of  Spanish  colonists  such  as  cultivating  and  exploiting  Taíno  land  with  enslaved  Taíno persons (Las Casas, 1992a, 2004; Todorov, 1999). At this point in time, las Casas' view of  Indigenous persons was more or less compatible with Sepúlveda's view that Indigenous persons were examples of  what  Aristotle  considered  natural  slaves  or  barbarians.  For  Aristotle,  certain  persons  are appropriately classified as natural slaves or barbarians because they are supposedly innately brutish and lack the capacity to reason. And on this basis, for Aristotle, those persons who do have a capacity to reason should control or enslave them (Aristotle &amp; Lord, 2013).\n\nOn  Christmas  of  1511,  the  Dominican  monk,  Antonio  Montesinos  delivered  an  antiConquistador sermon in the church of Santo Domingo (Las Casas, 2004). In this sermon, he railed against the immorality of the Spaniards ' treatment of the Indigenous Taíno people of the island of Hispaniola. He asked, 'with what right and with what justice do you keep these poor Indians in such cruel and horrible servitude?...Are these not men? Do they not have rational souls?' (Las Casas, 1992a, p.  xxi).  Upon  hearing  this  sermon,  las  Casas  did  not  immediately  change  his  views  and  thus  his treatment of Indian persons. But within three years of hearing this sermon, he renounced his 'claim' to or 'right over' the Indigenous persons that worked his land in Santo Domingo and Xaragua, Cuba.\n\nIt is at this point that he and Sepúlveda began to radically differ in their views of the moral status of Indigenous persons in the Americas.\n\nLas Casas spent many years of his very long life living among Indigenous peoples and cultures not only in the Caribbean but also in Central America and importantly in Mexico where he served as the Bishop of Chiapas. These years composed the long period between the moment when las Casas first  realizes  the  falsity of his view of Indigenous persons  and the point in time when he engaged Sepúlveda's anti -Indigenous argument in the Valladolid debate. Las Casas ' first -personal experience with Indigenous persons and cultures over such a long period, I will assume, allowed him to develop some understanding of Indigenous forms of life. As a result, this experience not only put him in a position to at least partly understand the degree of suffering and loss that befell the Indigenous peoples of the Americas due to the Spaniards' predilection for power, slaves, gold and land but it also put him in a position to understand the immorality of the Spaniards' actions that caused this suffering and loss. For Roberto Goizueta (2000, p. 188), Enrique Dussel has developed a similar view that las Casas realized the immorality of these actions as a result of taking the perspective of Indigenous persons rather than the Conquistadores' perspective. This view differs from the one I present because for Dussel perspective taking explains why las Casas realized the moral truth while on my account firstpersonal experience does more of the explaining of his realization. Here I assume that some minimal version of standpoint theory is true where this involves commitment to the view that certain social locations result in deeper understanding of injustice than others (Alcoff, 1999; Collins, 1990; Du Bois, 1903; Harding, 1995; Hartsock, 1998; Longino, 1990; Toole, 2019).\n\nHowever, I am not claiming that las Casas ' occupied the same social location that Indigenous persons occupied. As a consequence, he did not understand what it was like to be an Indigenous person.  What  I  am  claiming  is  that  dominant-group  subjects can develop  an  elevated  level  of understanding of injustice through (1) proximity to persons who suffer injustice and (2) having the\n\ncorrect emotional comportment towards those who experience injustice. For example, I grew up in an 'inner -city' Black and Latinx section of New York City. In this neighborhood there was one young white adolescent man who hung out with us, Black and Latinx adolescents, on the block on which I lived. That he was W hite was so remarkable that his nickname was, ' White man. ' This was a term of endearment.\n\n'White man,' was impoverished just like the rest of us adolescents of color. He experienced the crime and danger in the neighborhood that we, adolescents of color did. But despite this similarity of location and experience 'White man' knew that his experie nce differed from his Black and Latinx friends. As a result, 'White man' did not have the same understanding, or standpoint, that Black and Latinx  adolescents  had.  This  relation  that ' White  man ' had  to  understanding  of  injustice  in  this neighborhood, I take it, is analogous to how las Casas related to Indigenous persons in the Americas and  as  a  consequence  analogous  to  this  understanding  of  injustice  in  the  Americas. ' White  man ' understood much more than the average White person who was not similarly situated but, on the other hand, his understanding was less deep than the average Black or Latinx person in the same neighborhood.\n\nEven though I have painted  a  picture  according  to which  White  man's understanding  of injustice in this neighborhood largely but not entirely overlaps with the neighborhood's Black and Latinx adolescents, a consequence of the standpoint view that motivates this picture is that Black adolescent  understanding  of  injustice  could  differ  in  significant  ways  from  Latinx  adolescent understanding of this injustice. On this account, differences between Black and Latinx adolescents will depend on the different histories of injustice that compose their respective social locations. For example,  AfroLatinx  adolescents'  understanding  may  differ  less  from  Black  individuals'  similar understanding  than  Latinx  adolescents  with  identities  that  involve  more  anti-Indigenous  directed\n\ninjustice. Differences and similarities in understanding will correspond to differences and similarities in their social location.\n\nSepúlveda's situation starkly contrasts with las Casas' situation because Sepúlveda never set foot in the Americas. Sepúlveda was a philosopher and theologian at the  University of Salamanca which was a preserve of the Castilian elite. Sepúlveda was likely one of the first persons to instantiate what philosopher Charles Mills called White Ignorance. Someone instantiates White Ignorance if she holds a false belief or lacks a true belief because of whiteness or  anti-Black, Indigenous or Latinx racism (Mills, 2007). Mills called White Ignorance the obverse of standpoint. Sepúlveda may have been one of the first persons to instantiate White Ignorance because the notion of White or White persons qua race was developed in the years following Columbus' arrival in the Americas. Sepúlveda falsely believed that Indigenous persons were subpersons and thus did not have the same moral status as Spaniards or White-Europeans. I think that I safely assume that Sepúlveda held this false belief because of Whiteness or anti-Indigenous racism. As a consequence, Sepúlveda instantiated White Ignorance. That is, his dominant-group membership explains why he held this false belief.\n\nBut Sepúlveda instantiated White Ignorance even though he knew facts that were inconsistent with  this  White  Ignorance.  Sepúlveda  knew  that  the  Maya  and  Mexica  peoples  developed  highly advanced civilizations that at least rivaled if not surpassed European civilization (Sepúlveda, 1954). He knew that they had systems of writing, schools, bureaucracies, cities, systems of irrigation, taxation and monumental architecture. Despite this knowledge, he maintained commitment to his belief that Indigenous persons were natural slaves or barbarians and thus had a lower moral status in comparison to Spaniards in particular and Europeans in general. The idea is that this knowledge that Sepúlveda had constituted evidence which should have motivated him to either not form his false beliefs about Indigenous persons or revise these false beliefs.\n\nI submit that (1) the general human disposition to believe what feels good and avoid believing what feels bad and (2) Sepúlveda's dominant -racial group qua social location in significant measure jointly  explain  why  he  maintained  this  false  cognitive  commitment  in  the  face  of  knowledge inconsistent with it.\n\nHuman subjects will tend to believe in ways that allow them to  maintain their core beliefs (Bendaña &amp; Mandelbaum, In press; Mandelbaum, 2019). Examples of core beliefs that a subject will tend to maintain commitment to are that 'I am a good person' and 'I am a reliable person' (Bendaña &amp; Mandelbaum, In press). In the case of Sepúlveda, the belief that 'I am a good person,' I will assume roughly equals the belief that 'I am Christian.' I safely assume this because, in Europe, notions of goodness and badness, during the 1500s, were explained in terms of notions of good and bad drawn from the Christian New Testament and Catholic doctrine.\n\nWhen Sepúlveda encountered evidence that the Indigenous peoples of the Americas were not subpersons but actually persons, he could have either (1) accepted this evidence and as a consequence revised  his  belief  that  Indigenous  persons  were  subpersons  or  (2)  rejected  this  evidence  and maintained his belief that American Indigenous persons  were subpersons. If he had accepted this evidence, then he would have had to accept that he and other Spaniards endorsed, promoted and benefitted  from  the  wildly  immoral  and  non-Christian  states  of  affair  such  as  the  genocide  and systemic exploitation of these American peoples. If he accepted this, then he would have to accept that he and other Spaniards are not good Christians and thus not good people. Believing this feels bad and as a result Sepúlveda opted to reject this true belief. Here las Casas and Sepúlveda differ in terms of accepting this true belief at least partly because of the standpoint or social location that las Casas developed through engaging in some measure in Indigenous people's way of life.\n\nNotice that Sepúlveda was a dominant-group member explains why feeling good here resulted in his believing this falsehood, namely that he is a good Christian and a good person. To believe the\n\ntruth for Sepúlveda vis-à-vis how he as Spaniard related to the Indigenous persons of the Americas involved believing facts that feel bad to believe. This tended to involve feeling bad because dominant group members will tend to benefit from their membership in material and psychic ways that are incompatible  with  the  core  beliefs  that  typically  compose  any  human  subject's  positive  self -conception. For example, Du Bois (Du Bois, 1998) pointed out that White Americans in the 19 th and 20 th centuries not only benefited materially, but they also benefited psychically. On this Du Bois said, 'while [White group laborers] receive a low wage, [they] were compensated in part by a sort of public and psychological wage' (Du Bois, 1998, p. 700).\n\nLinda Martín Alcoff points out that for George Herbert Mead, the group identities into which subjects are born play a fundamental role i n forming persons' notion of self. Following Mead, for Alcoff, individuals do not have a 'fully formed self prior to [their] absorption in a system of social meanings' (Alcoff, 2015, p. 52). I take it that identities such as Black, White, Indigenous, Christian and Spaniard partly composed these systems of social meaning into which individuals were born. As a result, Sepúlveda's sense of self was very tightly conceptually connected to his view of himself as Christian and Spaniard. And a further consequence of this is that the encuentro between Spaniards and Indigenous peoples and the resulting Conquista, or more aptly put genocide, placed epistemic pressure on this false view that he had of himself and other Spaniards.\n\nSocial psychologists have noted that the first belief that a subject has on a topic will tend to more stubbornly resist counterevidence than the second, third, and subsequent beliefs that she forms vis-à-vis the same topic (Nisbett &amp; Ross, 1980) . If subjects' first beliefs about themse lves tend to be core beliefs about themselves and beliefs about their identity group's positive value, then Sepúlveda's belief that he and other Spaniards were good Christians would tend to resist counterevidence because these are some of the first beliefs that Sepúlveda would have formed about himself and his fellow\n\nidentity-group members. I assume that the fact that ' the Spaniards conduct in the Americas is wildly immoral ' is such counterevidence.\n\nSepúlveda believed in a way that allowed him to protect his identity from the threat of evidence that  disconfirmed  its  positive  value.  Daniel  Kahan  et.  al  (2007)  has  called  this  identity  protective cognition (Stanley, 2015). The truth of the nature of the Spaniards' conduct in the Americas pose d a threat to Sepúlveda's b elief that he was a good Christian and that Spaniards were good Christians. For Kahan et. al, 'individuals appraise information in a manner that buttresses beliefs associated with belonging to particular groups' (Kahan et al., 2007, p. 470). On this view, Sepúlveda believed as he did to defend his belief about belonging to the group 'Spaniards.'\n\n## Section II\n\nIn this section, I will explain the argument that Sepúlveda presents that war or genocide that the Spanish waged on Indigenous peoples was just. Then, I will explain las Casas ' refutation of this argument.\n\nSepúlveda's argumentative str ategy was to show that the Spaniards' war against the Indigenous peoples of the Americas was moral involved showing that the Indigenous persons of the Americas were not due the same moral treatment  as Christian Europeans. He was aware that he could not sim ultaneously maintain (1) that the Spaniards' war, and attending genocide, against the Indigenous peoples of the Americas was just and (2) that Indigenous persons had equal moral standing relative to Spaniards and other European Christians. If Indigenous persons have this equal moral standing, then this war was unjust and as a consequence Spaniards violated God's law. Sepúlveda's burden was to show that Indigenous persons do not have this equal moral standing. He attempted this by arguing that Indigenous persons are barbarians or natural slaves by Aristotle's lights (Birondo, 2020).\n\nSepúlveda assumed that a group of people are natural slaves if they have 'inferior intelligence along with inhuman and barbarous customs' (Sepúlveda, 1954, p. 494). Sepúlveda contrasted natural\n\nslaves with persons who are slaves by accident or by force. This kind of slave is a slave as a result of coercion, war or more generally the political state of affairs in her society. These non-natural slaves are not slaves because of some innate inferiority as is the case with natural slaves. So, natural slaves differ from non-natural slaves because natural slaves have some innate, internal property true of them that is not true of non-natural slaves.\n\nSepulveda  claimed that  'those…who  are  retarded  or  slow  to  understand…are  by  nature slaves' (Sepúlveda, 1954, p. 494). He pointed this out to claim that the Indigenous peoples of the Americas satisfy this description of natural slaves. But he recognized that he must reconcile the fact that the Mexica and Maya peoples had sophisticated, complex societies with this claim about their inferior and barbarous nature. To reconcile fact and falsehood, he attempted to undercut Mexica and Mayan ingenuity and  societal  attainment by  claiming  that  these  features  of  their  society  are  mere products of automatic non-rational, instinctual responses to their environment. To this end, he said, 'although some of them show a certain ingenuity for various works of artisanship, this is no proof of human cleverness, for we can observe animals, birds, and spiders making certain structures which no human accomplishment can competently imitate' (Sepúlveda, 1954, p. 497). What is more is that this is a claim that one can make about European or Iberian ingenuity, but this is precisely the kind of claim that Sepúlveda would be inclined to reject because it is incompatible with false beliefs he holds about himself and Christian Europe relative to Indigenous peoples and cultures.\n\nSepúlveda may have been one of the first philosophers in the western tradition to attempt to undercut  evidence  of  non-White  equality  with  Europeans.  This  tactic  will  be  picked  up  by  other western philosophers such as Immanuel Kant and David Hume. Hume in his essay, Of National Characters, attempted to explain away the reports he received of highly intelligent Black persons in Jamaica (Hume &amp; Haakonssen, 1994; Rosen Velasquez, 2008). He attempted to explain this away by claiming that such Black persons are merely repeating intelligent claims and comments they have heard\n\nfrom Whites like a parrot repeats its owner ' s phrases. In this essay, Hume argued that the characters of different peoples are a result of their environment rather than anything innate about persons or peoples. He makes this claim about Black persons to make clear to the reader that Black persons are an exception to his argument. Hume could not accept the logical conclusion of his own argument. Here Hume took a step down a path of bad argument cleared by Sepúlveda.\n\nSepúlveda  also  grounded  his  claim  that  that  Indigenous  persons  are  natural  slaves  in Indigenous persons' supposed status as barbarians (Nuccetelli, 2020, p. 3). Sepúlveda claimed that the 'Spanish have a perfect right to rule these barbarians of the New World and adjacent islands' because of Indigenous peoples' 'customs and manners' (Sepúlveda, 1954, p. 495). Sepúlveda invoked the notion of a barbarian here because he appealed to a kind of barbarian that Aristotle argued is fit to be ruled  by  others  due  to  their  intellectually  inferior  nature.  That  is,  for  Aristotle  certain  kinds  of barbarians are by nature slaves (Gracia &amp; Millán, 2004, p. 37; Las Casas, 1992b). This is one of four classes of barbarians that Aristotle describes (Aristotle &amp; Lord, 2013). Sepúlveda compared American Indigenous peoples with the Scythians of the Eurasian steps who were nomadic people that the ancient Romans and Greeks had conflict with and thus held in negative regard. He compared the Scythians to the Mexica because they both supposedly engaged in cannibalism. For Sepúlveda, the Indigenous peoples'  customs  along  with  the  practice  of  cannibalism  justified  his  view  that  they  more  fully manifested barbarism than the Scythians.\n\nLas Casas countered this argument by explaining that the Indigenous peoples of the Americas are barbarian with qualification. For las Casas, Sepúlveda erred regarding his exegesis of Aristotle's view of the notion of barbarian. Las Casas presented what he took as more accurate exegesis of this concept. According to this more accurate exegesis, Indigenous persons are not barbarians without qualification or innately barbarians. The basic point here is that some peoples are properly classed as\n\nbarbarian because of reasons external to them while, on the other hand, some peoples are properly classed as barbarian due to reasons internal to them.\n\nLas Casas pointed to four different kinds of barbarians. Someone counts as the first kind of barbarian if they act in 'cruel, or inhuman' w ays because of their incapacity to not allow emotions such as anger motivate this behavior. Las Casas pointed out that many of the Spanish Conquistadores have acted in ways such that they are properly identified as this kind of barbarian.\n\nThe second kind of barbarian's primary criterion of identity is the lack of a written language that corresponds with the one that a people speak. People who count as this kind of barbarian are only barbarians by accident or by circumstance rather than innately barbarian. The idea here is that it is  a  matter  of  chance  and  historical  situation  whether  a  people  develop  a  written  language.  As  a consequence,  the  Indigenous  peoples  who  did  not  have  a  written  language  were  not  innately barbarians but rather barbarians due to external or circumstantial reasons. On this point las Casas says, 'they are not barbarians literally but by circumstance' (Las Casas, 1992b, p. 58). Las Casas did know that the Maya peoples had a fully developed system of writing. As a result, I assume that he had in mind  the  non-Maya  peoples  here.  And  it  is  worth  noting  that  in  the  last  few  years  scholars  of Mesoamerica have realized that the Mexica had a fully developed writing system with a syllabary rather than a merely a pictographic system of storing information (Lacadena, 2008). As a consequence, on las Casas' view, the Mexica would not have counted as this kind of barbarian.\n\nA person counts as the third kind of barbarian if he, she or they act in immoral and wild ways where this is a result of an innately immoral, 'evil or wicked character' (Las Casas, 1992b, p. 59). For Sepúlveda, persons who count as this kind of barbarian are natural slaves in the Aristotelian sense. These people cannot act in accordance with societal laws because they act on the basis of their passions rather than their reason. These persons are extra-political because of this incapacity to bring their behavior in alignment with the norms and values of society. As a result, these individuals are natural\n\nslaves because they are not fit or capable of determining their own actions and life courses. Sepúlveda classed the Indigenous peoples of the Americas as this kind of barbarian and thus as natural slaves. It is on this basis that he argued that the war that the Spanish waged against them was just. That is, it was just because coercion and force are legitimately used in the service of controlling such individuals and peoples.\n\nLas Casas rejected the claim that the Indigenous persons of the Americas are this third kind of barbarian and as a consequence natural slaves. He did so by rejecting Sepúlveda's notion of this kind  of  barbarian  or  natural  slave.  By  identifying  Indigenous  peoples  as  this  kind  of  barbarian, Sepúlveda commits himself to the view that these kinds of persons can be found very widely. But, for las  Casas,  on  the  other  hand,  one  will  seldomly  find  such  barbarians  in  nature  because  they  are imperfect persons and God is a perfect being. The idea here is that individuals such as these should be extremely rare because they deviate from God's design for the average human being where a core feature of this design is that individuals have the capacity to rationally or autonomously act. Here Las Casas  assumes  that  the  existence  of  a  small  number  of  t rue  barbarians  is  compatible  with  God's perfection. The Indigenous persons of the Americas number in the millions and populate the areas of the Americas known to the Spaniards at the time (Gracia &amp; Millán, 2004; Las Casas, 2004; Todorov, 1999). Thus, las Casas reasoned, that Indigenous persons cannot be this kind of barbarian or natural slaves because they are too numerous.\n\n## Section III\n\nIn  this section,  I  will  explain  why  two  dominant-group  subjects,  Sepúlveda and  las Casas, differed  in  terms  of  the  accuracy  of  their  beliefs  about  the  metaphysical  and  moral  status  of  the Indigenous persons of the Americas. I will explain this by appeal to the states of understanding and knowledge. This explanation will involve two assumptions. The first assumption is that las Casas had a significant degree of understanding of Indigenous peoples, cultures and forms of life. The second\n\nassumption is that Sepúlveda had mere knowledge of these Indigenous peoples, cultures and forms of life. The importance of these two assumptions for this explanation is that las Casas and Sepúlveda differ in terms of the epistemic states explains why they differ on the matter of the metaphysical and moral status of America Indigenous peoples.\n\nIn  section  one,  I  explained  why  Sepúlveda  formed  and  sustained  the  false  belief  that Indigenous individuals were subpersons or natural slaves even though he had knowledge that was either in tension with or incompatible with this false belief such as that Mexica and Maya peoples had complex  organized  societies  with  highly  developed  calendars,  mathematics  and  architecture.  I explained this in terms of how (1) human subjects' general disposition to believe what feels good and not believe what feels bad relates to (2) Spaniards' or White Europeans' dominant-group identity. But this explanation leaves unaddressed why las Casas did not err in the same way.\n\nI submit that las Casas' understanding of Indigenous peoples of the Americas explains why h e ultimately did not believe that Indigenous persons are subpersons and or natural slaves. That las Casas developed this understanding may also explain why he transitioned from his initial role in Hispaniola as an encomendero, a participant and beneficiary of the encomienda land and slavery system, to the leading  advocate  for  moral  treatment  of  the  Indigenous  persons  and  even  reparations  from  the Spanish crown for the injustice and harms they suffered (Nuccetelli, 2020).\n\nTo motivate the claim that understanding explains why las Casas did not err like Sepúlveda, I will present two supporting reasons. The first reason is that understanding takes up more cognitive terrain than knowledge and as a consequence a subject will more often tend to notice inconsistencies between  cognitive  commitments.  The second  reason  is  that  understanding  can  involve  emotional comportment towards the target of understanding that overrides the general human disposition to avoid believing what feels bad.\n\nThis  first  reason  assumes  some  version  of  fragmentation  theory  is  true  (Bendaña  &amp; Mandelbaum, In press; Egan, 2008; Elga &amp; Rayo, In Press). Fragmentation theory is a view in the philosophy of cognitive science regarding how individuals store beliefs. According to one version of fragmentation theory, individuals store beliefs on independent data structures in the mind (Bendaña &amp; Mandelbaum, In press). These data structures are called belief fragments or mind fragments. The fragments that an individual stores her belief on will depend on when and where she forms the belief. As  a  consequence,  information  that  we  encounter  very  frequently  will  tend  to  reside  on  more fragments than information that we encounter less frequently. The idea here is that the more contexts in which a subjects forms a particular belief, the more fragments on which this belief will reside.\n\nThis view of belief storage explains why a person can hold a particular belief on one occasion and then hold a belief inconsistent with it on another occasion without sensing incoherence between these beliefs. This view explains this because a subject will only sense inconsistency between beliefs that reside on activated fragments. Fragments are activated by the context one is in. Some evidence of this is that individuals often go back to the places in which they formed a belief to recall it. If one belief is inconsistent with another belief, but one belief is on an activated fragment while the other is not,  then  a  subject  will  not  sense  the  inconsistency  between  them  because  subjects  only  sense inconsistency between beliefs that reside on fragments that are activated.\n\nNotice that the inconsistency that many White Americans manifest in the domain of racial injustice can be explained by appeal to fragmentation. Suppose that a White American, Chad, believes (1) that he deserves what has and (2) that racial injustice in the US obtains. These beliefs are either inconsistent or in tension because if racial injustice obtains and White persons unfairly benefit from racial injustice, then they cannot deserve what they have because they obtained what they have in virtue  of  unfair  advantage.  That  is,  unfair  advantage  due  to  racial  injustice  is  incompatible  with deserving  what  one  has.  Fragmentation  can  explain  why  Chad  does  not  sense  the  inconsistency\n\nbetween (1) and (2) because on this view (1) and (2) can reside on different fragments that are not both activated.\n\nFragmentation  theorists  have  analyzed  fragmentation  in  terms  of  belief  rather  than,  say, understanding. Beliefs on the one hand are often considered cognitive commitments to individual discrete propositions. Understanding on the other hand is often considered to involve more than a mere commitment to discrete propositions.\n\nMany epistemologists agree that understanding involves some 'extra' or 'further' cognitive feature beyond what knowing involves. Understanding can involve grasping the relations between ideas and concepts regarding an understanding target (Elgin, 2009), grasping explanatory relations and how things cohere in the domain of understanding (Kvanvig, 2003) and awareness of how the internal bits of the target of understanding relate to each other (Riggs, 2003). A view that cuts across these and many views of understanding is that 'understanding is directed at a complex of some kind…with parts that depend upon, and relate to, one another' which a subject 'grasps or apprehends when [she] unde rstands' (Grimm, 2012, p. 105).\n\nOn these views of understanding, knowledge differs from understanding because a s ubject's knowledge  merely  involves  a  cognitive  commitment  to  the  truth  of  a  discrete  proposition.  The traditional view is knowledge at least involves that the belief is true and justified. The important notion here is that knowledge is a belief with certain properties while understanding is not merely a belief with such properties. It involves more than this.\n\nIf  understanding involves something further such as grasping relations between ideas and concepts and a subject encountered these ideas in different contexts , then this subject's understanding will  involve  more  fragments  than  belief.  Understanding  will  involve  more  fragments  than  belief because grasping  the  relations  ideas  and  facts  that  compose  understanding  will  involve  activating information stored on several fragments. Understanding will involve activating information stored on\n\nseveral fragments because subject's tend to encounter the relevant facts and concepts in several or disparate  contexts.  Take  las Casas'  understanding  of  the  Taíno people.  Las  Casas  encountered information about the Taíno people in various regions of the islands of Hispaniola and Cuba over a period  of  many  years  (Las  Casas,  1992a).  As  a  result,  according  to  fragmentation  theory,  his understanding  of  the  Taíno  people  would  consist  in  information  and  ideas  that  reside  on  many different fragments because he encountered this information and these ideas in various times and places.\n\nThat  las Casas'  understanding  resided  on  so  many  fragments  explains  why  he  eventually jettisoned his false belief regarding the Taíno people's supposedly inferior metaphysical and thus moral status. It explains this because that he had this understanding made him more likely to notice the inconsistency  between  his  understanding  of  the  Taíno  people  and  this  false  belief.  According  to fragmentation theory, individuals will render consistent beliefs that are inconsistent which both reside on an activated fragment or fragments. Here las Casas' understanding activates more of his mind fragments and thus he will tend to notice and thus resolve more inconsistencies on them.\n\nOn the view of how understanding and fragmentation relate that I have presented, when a person understands something that involves information that she has learned in disparate contexts, she  will  activate  the  distinct  belief  fragments  that  this  information  was  stored  on.  And  as  a consequence she will resolve inconsistencies between information that is stored on separate fragments because she will notice information on one fragment that is inconsistent with information on another fragment.  If  this  account  is  correct,  then  it  should  be  plausible  that  las Casas'  understanding  of Indigenous peoples led him to reject falsehoods about the inferiority of Indigenous persons.\n\nI now present the second reason why las Casas did not err like Sepúlveda. This reason is that understanding can involve emotional comportment towards the target of understanding that overrides the general human disposition to avoid believing what feels bad. So far, I have explained Sepúlveda's\n\nerror in terms of how he is disposed to avoid believing what feels bad. As a result, Sepúlveda rejected information that Indigenous persons were fully human persons to avoid believing that he and other Spaniards were not good Christians.\n\nPresumably, las Casas as a Christian was susceptible to the same psychological disposition that resulted in Sepúlveda erring. Even though, I have explained why las Casas did not similarly err in terms of fragmentation, one might think that this psychological disposition could have overridden the effect of las Casas' understanding vis -à-vis whether he believed the falsehood that Indigenous persons were subpersons. But las Casas' understanding's effect on whether he falsely believed here may not have been overridden by this disposition if understanding involves an emotional comportment towards the target of understanding.\n\nEpistemologists have discussed understanding in purely intellectual terms. On this view of understanding, it involves features such as grasping relations, sensing coherence between facts and the capacity to explain a target of understanding. These epistemologists have not considered how the features of understanding may d iffer depending on what a subject's target of understanding consists in.\n\nTake understanding of injustice. I submit that if a person has sufficiently deep understanding of, say, racial injustice, then this person will have a certain emotional comportment towards racial injustice in general and those who both suffer and perpetrate injustice in particular.  Someone who understands racial injustice in the US will likely experience anger at the fact of White supremacy in the US. Consider the opposite. If someone claimed that they had sufficiently deep understanding of racial injustice in the US and they reported that they did not experience the emotion of anger towards this state of affairs, then a spectator might reasonably remark that this person did not actually have this understanding because anger directed at this state of affairs invariably accompanies this understanding\n\nof it. In other words, if someone understands this phenomenon well enough, then they will be angry. If someone is not angry, then this is a signal that they do not understand the phenomenon well enough.\n\nSimilarly, if las Casas had sufficiently deep understanding of the Indigenous peoples of the Americas, then one might think that he would experience the emotion of admiration vis-à-vis their achievements and positive features. If, on the other hand, he did not experience this emotion, then he presumably did not have sufficiently deep understanding of the Indigenous peoples of the Americas. But las Casas not only communicated that he experienced such an emotion that accompanied his understanding of the Indigenous peoples of the Americas but he also communicated that experienced the emotion of anger at the genocide and injustice that these peoples underwent at the hands of the Spanish Conquistadores.\n\nNow,  if  the  emotion  of  anger  accompanied  las Casas'  understanding  of  the  Indigenous genocide and the emotion of admiration accompanied his understanding of their achievements and positive features,  then,  together,  these  emotions  would  have  together  swamped  the  disposition  to avoid believing something that would have felt bad namely, that he and his fellow Spaniards in the Americas were bad Christians due to their wildly immoral treatment of Indigenous persons.\n\nOne might object that whether these emotions would have swamped this disposition to believe depends on the intensity of las Casas' emotions of admiration and anger relative to how bad it would have felt for him to believe that he, las Casas, was a bad Christian. A response to this is that this is an empirical question that social psychologists must settle. But I submit that if degree of understanding correlates with intensity of accompanying emotion, then las Casas' emotions of anger and admiration would have likely overridden these this disposition to believe.\n\n## Section IV\n\nIn this section, I will consider why las Casas incorrectly represented features of Indigenous persons  even  though  he  more  accurately  represented  Indigenous  persons  of  the  Americas  in\n\ncomparison to Sepúlveda. I explain why las Casas erred in this way by appeal to las Casas' conception of himself as an evangelizing Catholic Christian and his relative lack of standpoint. I will argue that this portion of his self-conception at least partly explains why he idealizes Indigenous persons and thus misrepresents them in some degree.\n\nIn las Casas ' Letter to the Council of the Indies, he said, 'At no other time and in no other people has there been seen such capacity, such predisposition, and such facility for conversation…Nowhere in the world are there countries more docile and less resistant, or more apt and better disposed than these to receive the yoke of Our Lord' (Todorov, 1999, p. 163).\n\nIn his Apologia , las Casas said, 'The Indians are of such decency, that they are more than the other nations of the entire world, supremely fitted and prepared to abandon the worship of idols and to accept, province by province and people by people, the word of God and the preaching of the truth' (Todorov, 1999, p. 163).\n\nLas  Casas  described  the  Indigenous  peoples  of  the  Americas  in  this  idealized  manner repeatedly.  He  paints  Indigenous  peoples  that  differ  in  terms  of  language,  culture,  belief-system, societal organization and appearance with a broad brush that does not acknowledge these differences. Regarding this, Tzvetan Todorov points out that las Casas described Indigenous 'populations equally distinct and even remote from each other, from Florida to Peru; yet they are all…invariably 'gentle and peaceloving' (Todorov, 1999, p. 164).\n\nLas Casas represented the Indigenous peoples of the Americas without acknowledging (1) the differences  that  obtained  between  them  and  (2)  that  they  had  negative  features  or  flaws  just  like peoples from the rest of the world. He represented them in this way partly because he was attempting to persuade the Spanish Crown and authorities to intervene on behalf of Indigenous persons. That las Casas presented the Indigenous peoples of the Americas as morally outstanding peoples who were the perfect recipients of Catholic doctrine put him in a position to more fervently demand that the\n\nCrown halt the ongoing genocide. The idea is that if a people are more likely to accept the word of God than other peoples of the world, then this is a reason to safeguard them because converting souls to the Christian faith was not only commanded by God but also kept their souls from the eternal fires of hell.\n\nLas  Casas  representation  of  the  Indigenous  peoples  of  the  Americas  as  lacking  negative features  required  him  to  deemphasize  the  differences  between  them  because  downplaying  their differences was less in tension with the view that they were some of the best possible recipients of Catholic doctrine. The idea is that las Casas ' goal of convincing the Crown of the idea that they were ready to jettison their paganism is easier to accomplish if Indigenous peoples were viewed as largely the same rather than a set of vastly different peoples. It is easier to accomplish on this view because if  Indigenous  peoples greatly varied,  then  their  readiness  for  the  word of  God  would  more  likely greatly vary as well.\n\nSo far, I have presented a polemical reason why Las Casas misrepresented the Spanish Crown. These may at least partly explain why Las Casas misrepresented Indigenous persons in this way, but this reason does not necessarily require that he actually endorsed or believed the idealized way he represented them. However, I will now present a psychological reason that if true can explain why las Casas inaccurately believed that the Indigenous peoples instantiated this idealization he presented in his arguments. Las Casas devoted most of his very long life to defending and advocating on behalf of the Indigenous peoples of the Americas. This became part of who he was and for good reason.\n\nIf (1) las Casas' self -conception was partly constituted by his view of himself as the defender of the Indians, (2) it felt good for him to believe that he was defending a group of people most likely to accept Catholic doctrine and (3) it felt bad for him to believe that was not defending such a people, then (4) that las Casas developed this idealized view of Indigenous peoples  is consistent with this\n\nhuman tendency to believe in ways that preserve individuals ' positive self-conceptions or cherished beliefs about themselves.\n\nThese polemical and psychological reasons are not mutually exclusive. I submit that they can jointly explain why las Casas represented Indigenous persons in this idealized and thus false way. Las Casas may have developed this idealized view of Indigenous persons because of its polemical utility, but then he could have also come to hold the view due to how it related to his positive self-conception of himself as a defender of Indigenous peoples and as a good Christian evangelist. On the other hand, he may have come to this view for this psychological reason and then, that this view was so polemically useful, he may have become more committed to it.\n\nSome have pointed out that las Casas' construal of the Mesoamerican ritual practice of human sacrifice as compatible with natural law is in tension with his claim that Indigenous peoples have equal moral status as Europeans (Carman, 2016; Nuccetelli, 2017) . According to las Casas' and his peers' understanding of natural law theory, human subjects can distinguish between morally right and wrong actions because of a God-given capacity to reason (Carman, 2016). There is a tension here because las Casas  attributes  the  capacity  to  reason  to  Indigenous  persons  even  though  some  Mesoamerican societies practiced human sacrifice. Here the fact that Indigenous persons did not recognize human sacrifice's immorality is incompatible with the notion that they have the capacity to reason and thus that they are human subjects due moral treatment. To resolve this tension las Casas argued that a human subject's capacity to reason alone ma y not suffice for her to recognize that human sacrifice is immoral. For las Casas, divine law or Christian doctrine in addition to human reason suffice to put a subject in a position to recognize human sacrifice's immorality and as a consequence that Indigenous societies  had  not  yet  received  Christian  doctrine  explained  why  they  did  not  recognize  human sacrifice's immorality. The psychological and polemical reasons to which I appeal to explain why las\n\nCasas erred in his representations of the Indigenous peoples of the Americas can also explain why he presented an argument that featured what is at least a prima facie tension.\n\nHowever, scholars of the Valladolid debate differ on whether las Casas' argument involved an actual  or  ultima  facie  tension  (Brunstetter  &amp;  Zartner,  2011;  Méndez  Alonzo,  2017).  And  some anthropologists  have  come  to  view  the  Mesoamerican  practice  of  human  sacrifice  as  a  part  of Mesoamerican warfare and power relations in a way very similar to how Western warfare and power relations result in the killing of thousands or even millions of persons (Graham, 2012; Metze, 2014). Others have argued that Mesoamerican societies may have featured less killing than European societies even though they featured human sacrifice (Dodds Pennock, 2014). If the nature of Mesoamerican human sacrifice is unclear, then whether las Casas' argument features commitments that are either in tension or contradictory should also be unclear because the immorality of a practice depends on the features of the practice.\n\nNow, someone might object that the account that I have presented implies that las Casas ' understanding of the Indigenous peoples of the Americas exculpates him of blame for his role in the European acculturation of the Indigenous societies of the Americas. The thought here is that this kind of understanding has some sort of higher or superior moral status to Sepúlveda's mere knowledge of the Indigenous peoples of the Americans such that las Casas is properly evaluated as less morally blameworthy for his role in this acculturation in comparison to Sepúlveda.\n\nA reply to this objection is that the account that I have presented merely invokes how the epistemic states of understanding and knowledge of a particular content relate to the social locations of two subjects, namely las Casas and Sepúlveda. This account does not involve a commitment to the moral or exculpatory value of understanding or knowledge vis-àvis las Casas' and Sepúlveda's roles in the European acculturation of the Americas. It does not involve this commitment because in this account I only examine how moral and political features of the 16 th century world relate to how well\n\nor poorly these two subjects represent it. An account that sheds light on what degree las Casas is culpable for this acculturation would involve explanation of how his understanding relates to the ways he promoted this acculturation. This account does not involve explanation of this relation and thus it does not involve a view of the degree to which las Casas is morally culpable for this acculturation.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI have argued that las Casas and Sepúlveda differed in their conclusions regarding the status of Indigenous persons at least partly because las Casas had significant, yet incomplete, understanding of Indigenous persons, culture and societies and Sepúlveda has mere knowledge of them. To this end, I have shown that the epistemic state of understanding explains why Las Casas properly concludes that Indigenous persons deserve the same moral status afforded to Europeans. And I have shown how las Casas' understanding of Indigenous persons, culture and societies r elated to what he got wrong about Indigenous persons.\n\n## References\n\nAlcoff, L. M. (1999).
