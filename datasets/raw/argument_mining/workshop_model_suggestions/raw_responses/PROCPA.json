One  of  the  fears  that necessarily come along with it is about the peril cloning might represent for human uniqueness, since the clones are expected to be identical to their prototypes; this would unavoidably compromise moral agents' right to a unique identity. In this paper I will put under examination the argument against cloning that is based upon the right to a unique identity; I will argue that cloning represents no actual threat for anybody's unique identity, therefore this argument is futile. I will also support the view that the so-called right to a unique  identity  is  not  as  indisputable  as  to  serve  as  the  basis  of  a  moral  argument  against  human reproductive cloning.\n\nKeywords: Human cloning, rights, identity, uniqueness, individuality.\n\nThe possibility of creating human beings by means of transferring the nucleus of a somatic  cell  to  an  enucleated  ovum  is  very  likely  to  allow  in  the  near  future  for  the production of humans identical to already existing ones, or to ones that once existed, but now do  not 1 .  These  genetically  manufactured  humans  are  usually  being  referred  to  as clones , and the persons from whom the somatic cell nuclei have been extracted are being called prototypes .  In  my opinion both terms are undue and misleading; I will use them henceforward, however, for reasons of compliance with the established terminology. The fact  that  the  clones  and  their  prototypes  will  allegedly  be  identical  to  each  other  is considered by some bioethicists to constitute a major threat to some moral rights of the clones, rights that non-clones are free to enjoy, such as the right to ignorance 2 , or that to\n\n1 National Bioethics Advisory Commission ,  Cloning Human Beings: Report and Recommendations of the National Bioethics Advisory Commission (Rockville, Maryland June 1997), 13.\n\n2 See Sören Holm, 'A Life in the Shadow: One Reason Why We Should Not Clone Humans', Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics 7 (1998): 160-162.

There is a particular right, however, that is considered to be not just threatened, but a priori and inescapably violated by the very fact that a person is being born as a clone. This is the right to a unique identity, to individuality, or to uniqueness, a right  that  a  clone  will  be  in  no  position  to  enjoy  or  even  claim  due  to  his  or  her  very particular nature and the way he or she has come into existence 4 . In this short paper I will support  the  view  that  this  objection  is  grounded  neither  on  fact  nor  on  reason.  In particular,  I  will  argue  that:  [a]  cloning  does  not  actually  compromise  neither  the prototype's  nor  the  clone's  unique  identity,  [b]  the  right  to  a  unique  identity  is  not  as indisputable as to bolster any moral argument.\n\nAs for my first claim, namely that cloning poses no threat to anyone's uniqueness, I  cannot  resist  the  temptation  of  starting  with  an  argument  that  might  sound  like  a sophism: if the term clone by  definition  describes  a  potential  person  that  would  be  the exact  copy  of  another  individual,  the  prototype,  and  if  the  prototype  is  a  unique individual,  then  the  clone  should  be  a  unique  individual  as  well,  otherwise  he  or  she could  not  be  an  exact  copy.  Hence,  either  the  clone  -  as  an  exact  copy  of  a  unique individual - is a unique individual too, so no one's uniqueness is at stake, or the clone is not an exact copy of the prototype - since he or she lacks at least one property or quality the  prototype  possesses  -  so  again  no  one's  individuality  is  being  compromised.  This sounds like a witticism, of course, since common belief holds on the one hand that exact duplication is achievable, and on the other that the property or quality of uniqueness is exactly what is being destroyed by duplication.\n\nTo Leibniz, however, my sophism would rather seem as a synopsis of his view that there can be no exact duplicates in nature, either natural or artificial. To him, '… it is not  true  that  two  substances  can  resemble  each  other  completely  and  differ  only  in number' 5 , or, as he explains elsewhere, 'in nature, there cannot be two individual things that  differ  in  number  alone . For  it  certainly  must  be  possible  to  explain  why  they  are different, and that explanation must derive from some difference they contain… for never do we find two eggs or two leaves or two blades of grass in a garden that are perfectly similar.  And  thus,  perfect  similarity  is  found  only  in  incomplete  and  abstract  notions, where  things  are  considered  only  in  a  certain  respect' 6 .  This  is  Leibniz's  law  for  the identity  of  the  indiscernibles,  according  to  which  if  two  beings  have  every  quality  of theirs in common, they cannot be two , but are actually one . Tagging along after Leibniz John McTaggart derived his own law for the dissimilarity of the diverse by applying the rule  of  contraposition  to  Leibniz's  maxim:  if  two  beings  are  numerically  distinct,  then they should also be qualitative distinct, to wit there must be at least one quality that one\n\n3 See Helga Kuhse, 'Should Cloning Be Banned for the Sake of the Child?', Poiesis and Praxis 1 (2001): 17-33, 20.

Stresses that each individual has a right to his or her own genetic identity and that human cloning is, and must continue to be, prohibited; 2.  Calls for an explicit worldwide ban on the cloning of human beings; 3.  Urges the Member States to ban the cloning of human beings at all stages of formation and development, regardless of the method used […]'.\n\n5 Gottfried  W.  F.  von  Leibniz,  'Discourse  on  Metaphysics', Philosophical  Essays ,  translated  by  Roger Ariew &amp; Daniel Garber (Indianapolis: Hackett, 1989), 41-42.\n\n6 Ibid., 'Primary Truths', 32.\n\nof  these  two  beings  has,  but  the  other  lacks 7 .  As  McTaggart  puts  it,  diversity  implies dissimilarity,  and  two  things  cannot  be  exactly  equal,  or  have  the  same  nature.  If Leibniz's and McTaggart's views were applied to cloning, we could only agree that since the  clone  and  his  or  her  prototype  will  be  numerically  distinct  from  each  other 8 ,  there should  be at  least  one quality  they  will  not  have  in  common,  therefore  they  will necessarily  be  also  qualitative  discernible.  It  seems  that  in  the  charming  and  orderly arranged world of propositional logic - or, better, of metaphysics based on logic - my initial claim that cloning threatens nobody's uniqueness wouldn't that easy be rejected as a witticism.\n\nOur world, however, is not that of propositional logic, therefore arguments like the  one  I  just  presented  are  not  expected  to  serve  as  a  satisfactory  response  to  moral objections. They surely didn't convince the members of the European Parliament, who declared that each individual has a right to his or her own genetic identity and that human cloning  is,  and  must  continue  to  be,  prohibited 9 ,  or  bioethicists  like  Arthur  Caplan, among others, who argued regarding cloning that 'one of the things we treasure about ourselves is our individuality.... You begin to worry that when you deliberately set out to make  copies  of  something,  you  lessen  its  worth' 10 .  It  seems  that  we  think  of  our uniqueness so highly, that much greater effort is required to appease the fear that it might be compromised due to cloning. But in which way could human uniqueness be threatened by virtue of cloning?\n\nAs I see things, individuals in general are different or similar to each other with regard to [a] their genome, [b] their phenotype and, [c] their character and personality. When we say that an individual is unique, we assume that it features at least one - even a slight  -  difference  to  every  other  of  its  kind  concerning  one  of  these  three  above mentioned categories. It follows that, if an individual is identical to any other of its kind, it has to be such with regard to every single one of its properties or attributes at the same time. Cloning, therefore, would be a threat to an individual's unique identity, if and only if  it  proved  capable  of  providing  scientists  with  the  means  to  produce  at  least two individuals  with  exactly  the  same  genes,  looks  and  character  at  the  same  time.  This, however, doesn't seem to be a part of the actual powers of cloning.\n\nCloning concerning humans so far seems to be attainable primarily - if not solely - by means of nuclear transfer, a process that could be roughly outlined as extracting the nucleus of a somatic cell taken from the prototype and transferring it to an enucleated ovum in order to produce a clone; this method allegedly guarantees that the clone will be an exact genetic copy of the somatic cell donor 11 . This is not exactly accurate, however. As  far  as  genomic  identification  is  concerned,  it  is  true  that  the  clone's  gene-set  is expected to be almost fully determined by the genetic information that is being contained in the nucleus of the donor's somatic cell. The nucleus, though, has to be implanted into an enucleated ovum, and the ovum will necessarily convey its own genetic information to the  clone  contributing  thus  to  the  clone's  genome.  The  cytoplasm,  actually,  which\n\n7 John McTaggart, The Nature of Existence (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988), vol. 1, § 94.\n\n8 Kathinka Evers, 'The Identity of Clones', Journal of Medicine and Philosophy 24.1 (1999): 67-76, 69.\n\n9 See supra note 4.\n\n10 Quoted in Ruth Macklin, 'Splitting Embryos on the Slippery Slope: Ethics and Public Policy', Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal 4.3 (1994): 209-225, 215.\n\n11 National  Bioethics  Advisory  Commission, Cloning  Human  Beings:  Report  and  Recommendations (Rockville, Maryland, 1997), 14.\n\nbelongs to the ovum, passes on to the new organism the mitochondrial DNA 12 , which is a tiny  0,  05  %  of  the  individual's  overall  genetic  information 13 .  This  might  seem  like  a negligible  proportion,  but  in  genetics  such  genomic  dissimilarities  are  of  enormous significance  and  result  in  huge  differences,  especially  if  we  consider  that  between humans and apes stands only  a fragile  2  %  of  genetic  difference,  which,  nevertheless, results in two totally different species. A clone, of course, could only share the genetic information  of  his  or  her  prototype's  nuclear  DNA;  his  or  her  mitochondrial  DNA, nevertheless,  would  be  necessarily  different,  since  the  enucleated  ovum  that  would  be used  in  the  procedure  of  his  or  her  cloning  could  never  be  identical  to  the  ovum  that produced the prototype. In other words, even if our purpose was to duplicate the exact Mozart's  genome,  for  example,  in  order  to  succeed  in  this  we  would  need  to  be  in possession not only of one of Mozart's somatic cells, but also of an ovum extracted from his mother's oocytes 14 . But not just any ovum would suffice; the only ovum that would allow  an  exact  genomic  duplication  of  Mozart  would  be  the  one  that  had  been  once fertilized to produce Mozart, since the genetic information contained in two different ova is not stable, even if both have been retrieved from the very same oocyte 15 . In the light of all these some feel safe even to argue that a clone should reasonably be expected to have more  genetic  differences  to  the  prototype  than  identical  twins  actually  have  to  each other 16 .  If  these  empirical  data  are  correct,  they  seem  to  prove  beyond  any  reasonable doubt that exact genomic replication far exceeds the powers of genetic engineering: even if the genomic difference between the clone and the prototype would be as slight as 0, 05 %, the clone would still be genetically different to the prototype although very similar ; in any case, these two beings would not be identical .  Given  all  these,  genetic  uniqueness seems not to be at stake in the case of human reproductive cloning.\n\nLet  us,  however,  assume  for  the  sake  of  the  discussion  that  the  advances  in genetics in the near future are likely to allow geneticists to overcome the obstacles posed by  the  mitochondrial  DNA,  and  that  exact  duplication  of  the  human  genome  would become achievable. In my view the prospect of producing two individuals with exactly the same genome wouldn't be that objectionable or that fearsome if it didn't necessarily lead to identical phenotypes. But does it? Geneticists so far conclude that our phenotype, to wit the way we actually are and look, is not determined solely by our genes 17 . Aside from the gene-set there are numerous other variables that affect gene expression and have a  major  impact  on  our  phenotype.  Such  factors  are,  among  others,  the  intrauterine environment 18 , the stages of placentation and embryo-maternal circulation 19 , the\n\n12 Helga Kuhse, 'Should Cloning Be Banned for the Sake of the Child?', Poiesis and Praxis 1 (2001): 1733, 21.\n\n13 Françoise  Baylis,  'Human  Cloning:  Three  Mistakes  and  an  Alternative', Journal  of  Medicine  and Philosophy 27.3 (2002): 319-337, 324-325.\n\n14 Leon Eisenberg, 'The Outcome as Cause: Predestination and Human Cloning', The Journal of Medicine and Philosophy 1.4 (1976): 318-331, 326.\n\n15 Bernard E.

Given all these, we are allowed to assume that not only will a clone be different from his or her prototype with regard to his or her phenotype, but also that multiple clones of the same prototype might differ to each other in some degree, as well 21 . Even if this wasn't the case, however, and a clone actually looked exactly the same as his or her prototype, I don't see why this should be considered of major moral significance concerning either the clone's or the prototype's right to a unique identity. If physical similarity or identification could actually infringe one's  uniqueness,  we  should  assume  the  same  with  regard  to  monozygotic  twins. Nevertheless, according to the majority of people -philosophers included! -monozygotic twins are perfectly unique individuals: they are being treated as such, and nobody seriously maintains that their right to a unique identity has been violated by the fact  that  they  have  been  born  as  twins.  To  quote  John  Harris,  'artificial  clones  do  not raise any difficulties not raised by the phenomenon of natural twins' 22 .  We do not feel apprehensive when natural twins are born, why should we when twins are deliberately created?  One  could  object,  of  course,  that  natural  twins  just  occur  as  a  natural phenomenon, while clones will be created by choice, and moral evaluation is applicable only  to  deliberate  human  deeds.  This  objection  would  stand  in  the  case  monozygotic twins were born only due to spontaneous natural genetic procedures. This is not the case, however.  Many  people  undergo  fertility  enhancement  therapies  perfectly  aware  of  the fact  that  these  techniques  more  than  often  result  in  multiple  pregnancy.  Nobody, however, assumes that this deliberate choice of theirs to undergo fertility enhancement therapies is morally objectionable due to the risk of giving birth to monozygotic twins 23 . Since  in  the  case  of  natural  clones  we  do  not  tend  to  assume  that  something  morally wrong has happened, I don't see why we should think the contrary in the case of artificial clones a fortiori since  that  they  are  likely  to  be  much less  similar to their prototypes than  monozygotic  twins  are  to  their  brothers  or  sisters  for  the  reasons  I  previously explained.\n\nSo  far  I  have  argued  that  the  exact  duplication  of  the  human  genome  and phenotype  is  not  in  the  powers  of  human  reproductive  cloning,  and  it  seems  highly unlikely that it ever is. Therefore either the clone's or the prototype's right to a unique identity is being at stake due to human reproductive cloning, at least as far as genomic and phenotypic uniqueness is concerned. At this point I could rest my case, since it is more than obvious that two persons that would be genetically unlike (even slightly) and would also look different (even slightly) would necessarily count as unique individuals , even  if  they  shared  exactly  the  same  character  and  personality  traits.

Such a belief could stand only in the light of the strictest genetic determinism, which is a view that assumes that the character and the personality of humans is being determined only by the genomic heritage a person is  endowed  with,  to  wit  by  genetic  information  contained  into  one's  DNA,  and  that neither the environment in which one grows, nor chance or free will have a part in the formation of one's personality. I totally disagree with genetic determinism, but this is not the  time  to  argue  in  detail  against  it.  I  will  only  suggest  that  appealing  to  genetic determinism  in  order  to  argue  that  cloning  is  morally  unjustifiable  because  it  violates someone's moral right to his or her unique identity, in my view seems to be neither a clever nor an effective choice. This is because, if both personality and character are being determined only by a given gene-set, one's deeds are not for one to decide about; they are rather  inevitable  events  to  which  one  is  being nolents  volents dragged  by  one's  own inherent  genetic  disposition.  If  this  is  so,  debates  on  moral  issues  -  including  the  one concerning the right to a unique identity in relation to human reproductive cloning - are only in vain: people will eventually do what their genes compel them to do; therefore all arguments  for  or  against  cloning  (the  one  that  focuses  on  genetic  determinism  all  the same) couldn't  be  of  any  real  significance.  Nevertheless,  those  that  oppose  cloning  on grounds of genetic determinism seem to hold that their arguments concerning the alleged violation  of  the  clone's  right  to  a  unique  personality is  of  some  significance for  the debate, at least as long as they claim that their views should be taken into account. But not both can stand at the same time; either genetic determinism is true and moral debates are nothing more than just shadow play, or moral discussions have decisive impact on the choices  of  moral  agents  and  genetic  determinism  is  false.  If  genetic  determinism  may apply to clones, it should equally apply to bioethicists as well.\n\nIn this paper I invested all my efforts in arguing that human reproductive cloning puts neither the clone's nor the prototype's uniqueness at stake, hence the so-called right to a unique identity is irrelevant to the debate concerning human reproductive cloning. I would like to conclude with some further thoughts on the applicability of such a right in the case of human cloning. As I see it, a moral right outlines some kind of permission or freedom that all moral agents should enjoy concerning their choices; in other words, if a person is being acknowledged the moral right to something , then this person is free to opt - or not to opt - for this something . This something on the one hand has to be considered of  such  high  moral  significance  as  to  have  a  moral  right  exclusively  tailored  to  its protection (a right to chewing gum, for example, would be nonsensical), and on the other hand it should be in actual peril of being deprived from its claimant or holder due to other moral agents' acts or omissions. When it comes to the so-called right to a unique identity, in  my  view  not  all  the  above  requirements  are  actually  being  met.  To  begin  with,  not every moral agent can claim the so-called right to a unique identity: naturally born twins surely cannot. As a matter of fact, this right seems to have been tailored exclusively for clones. If this is the case, then we should have to accept two distinct categories of rights holders,  one  of  non-clones  (with  lesser  moral  rights,  since  non-clones  would  not  be allowed  the  right  to  a  unique  identity),  and  another  one  of  clones  (who  would  be acknowledged all the rights of the former plus the one to a unique identity). Even if this was  possible,  I  cannot  see  how  it  could  be  morally  defended.  As  for  the  second requirement, to argue that one has the right  to  be  born  a  unique  individual  can  only\n\nimply that one would be severely damaged or harmed if he or she was born identical to somebody else. But this is not always - or, according to some, it can never be 24 -  the case.  Anyone  who  experiences  the  misfortune  of  having  been  born  with  spina  bifida, cystic  fibrosis  or  hydrocephalus  would  eagerly  give  away  his  or  her  right  to  a  unique identity for a chance to be identical to a person with better prospects in life. Uniqueness seems to have been a bit overestimated as a property and, anyway, clones could think of it as less valuable to them than we do. As for the third requirement, the one that focuses on the potential peril that cloning could represent for either the clone's or the prototype's uniqueness, I have already at length argued that such a view cannot easily be defended.\n\nThe  moral  debate  concerning  cloning  -  and,  in  particular,  human  cloning  -  is probably the most challenging in our times, and this is not without a good reason: in its core lurk miracles and hopes, power and dreams, high stakes and equally high risks. As it is  with  every  moral  issue  of  such  significance  human  cloning has  fervent advocates as well as dedicated opponents, and both come with sharp arrows in their quivers. In this paper  I  endeavored  to  determine  the  sharpness  of  one  of  these  arrows,  and  I  found  it faulty.  I  argued  that  cloning  does  not  compromise either the  clone's or the prototype's right to a unique identity primarily because the exact duplication of the human genome, phenotype and personality is beyond the powers of today's genetics. I also suggested that the right to a unique identity is not as indisputable as to bolster any moral argument. But this issue is just a part of a debate that is expected to last long and be a challenging one.\n\n## Literature\n\nAdams Robert M., 'Existence, Self-Interest, and the Problem of Evil',\n\nNoûs\n\n13 (1979): 53-65.\n\nBayles Michael, 'Harm to the Unconceived',\n\nPhilosophy &amp; Public Affairs\n\n5 (1976): 292-304.\n\nBaylis Françoise, 'Human Cloning: Three Mistakes and an Alternative', Journal of Medicine and Philosophy 27.3 (2002): 319-337.\n\nBrock  Dan,  'Cloning  Human  Beings:  An  Assessment  of  the  Ethical  Issues  Pro  and  Con',  in Cloning and the Future of the Human Embryo Research ,  edited by Paul Lauritzen, 93-113 (New York:  Oxford University Press, 2001).\n\nDavis Dena, 'Genetic Dilemmas and the Childs Right to an Open Future', Hastings Center Report 27.2 (1997): 7-15.\n\nEisenberg  Leon,  'The  Outcome  as  Cause:  Predestination  and  Human  Cloning', The  Journal  of Medicine and Philosophy 1.4 (1976): 318-331.\n\nEvers Kathinka, 'The Identity of Clones', Journal of Medicine and Philosophy 24.1 (1999): 6776.\n\nFeinberg Joel, Freedom  and Fulfillment: Philosophical Essays (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1994).\n\nHarris  John,  'Goodbye  Dolly?'

The premises provide scientific evidence about genetic differences and analogies to natural twins to support these claims. I've included only the most crucial ADUs that form the backbone of the argument, avoiding peripheral details and examples.",
