    "user_content": "## Reviving Spiritualism with Monads Francisque Bouillier's impossible mission (1839-1864)\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nNineteenth-century French 'spiritualism' is a paradigmatic case of a philosophical movement that is construed and mediated through the reception of early modern authors The aim of this contribution is to study certain tensions and developments in this movement, focusing on two questions that were formulated by the philosopher Francisque Bouillier. First: Is it possible to overcome the overly narrow Cartesian conception of the soul by appealing to the dynamic ontology of Leibnizian monads? Second: Might the reference to Leibniz help to consolidate rational  spiritualism,  protecting  it  from  materialist  attacks,  without  however  falling  into  the excesses of those physicians in the medical faculties who adhered to strong forms of animism or vitalism? The timespan studied, from the Histoire de la philosophie cartésienne (1839) to the Du principe  vital  ou  de  l'âme  pensante (1864),  follows  Cousinian  eclecticism  from  its highpoint  through  its  progressive  institutional  decline.  The  article  combines  two  analytical approaches. On the one hand, I study the reception of Descartes and Leibniz in Bouillier; on the  other,  I  study  how  Bouillier's  readings  had  to  be  mediated  through  certain  positionsCartesian,  Cousinian,  and  spiritualist-medical-in  order  to  gain  an  audience.  I  will  thus examine  the  passages  in  Bouillier's  texts  where  institutional  effects  are  felt  and  where  he positions himself intellectually in relation to those institutions. At the same time, I reconstruct a  philosophical  scene  that  was  asymmetrically  occupied  by  authors  all  motivated  by  a common  effort,  namely,  mobilizing  early  modern  authors  (here  essentially  Descartes  and Leibniz) in order to stand out individually in a stifling institutional context. 1 The analyses will mainly show how Bouillier opened up a new path for spiritualism which, by proposing new readings of Descartes and Leibniz and stressing the notion of an 'inner sense of life,' allowed for an authentic dialogue with the life sciences.\n\n## 2. The context: The 1839 competition on the history of Cartesianism\n\nThe beginning of the 1840s was a key moment for Cousinian eclecticism. Let us briefly recall who Victor Cousin (1792-1867) was, and the all-important role he played in French academia in the nineteenth century. Cousin entered the French Academy and the State Council in 1830.\n\n1\n\nOn this, see Vermeren (1995).\n\nIn 1832, he became a member of the Council for Public Instruction where he was charge of philosophy. He was elected a member of the newly created Académie des sciences morales et politiques and  appointed  director  of  the Ecole  Normale  Supérieure .  In  1840,  under  the government  of  Thiers,  he  was  minister  of  public  instruction  for  some  eight  months.  He presided  over  the concours  d'agrégation -an  essential  exam  for  anyone  wishing  to  enter academia-for 27 years. During the period we are concerned with, he possessed all the means necessary to fulfill his intellectual and political ambitions. But for this very reason, he was also  very  strongly  criticized, 2 mainly  because  his  brand  of  Cartesianism  was  incapable  of providing a satisfactory response to the rise of the life sciences and of responding adequately to the onslaughts against 'pan-metaphysics' from influential figures such as Broussais. 3\n\nThe  Cousinian  movement  was  thus,  somewhat  paradoxically,  threatened  exactly because  it  was  so  powerful.  Hence,  when  the Academie des sciences morales et politiques proposed  the  writing  of  a  detailed  history  of  Cartesianism  as  the  theme  of  the  1839 competition, the aim was clear, namely exploiting all the resources of Cartesian philosophy in order to strengthen spiritualism against its adversaries. The jury included Cousin, Degérando, Damiron,  St.  Hilaire,  Edwards,  and  Jouffroy.  When  the  dissertations  were  submitted (anonymously),  they were  read by two  members  of  the  jury.  Their  remarks  would subsequently be included in a final report, written by Damiron. Winning dissertations were intended  for  publication,  on  condition  of  revision  following  the  suggestions  made  in  the report.  In  1839,  seven  dissertations  were  submitted:  one  arrived  too  late;  two  received  the distinction  'very  honorable'  (Bouillier  and  Renouvier);  Bordas-Demoulin  won  the  prize. Among the remaining  three  contestants,  the  identity  of  only  one  was  ever  divulged:  JeanAndré  Rochoux,  a  somewhat  subversive  nurse  working  at  the  Hospital  Bicêtre.  Rochoux published  his  dissertation  at  his  own  expense  in  1843  under  the  title Épicure  opposé  à Descartes 4 .\n\nApart  from  the  simple  servile  reproduction  of  the  Cousin's  doctrine,  the  candidates had the choice between the following two approaches. The first was to attack Cartesianism frontally,  attempting  to  completely  overturn  the  philosophical  landscape.  This  was  the approach chosen by Rochoux and obviously banned him immediately from the podium of the\n\n2 On spiritualism in nineteenth century France, see Janicaud (1997).\n\n3 François Joseph Victor Broussais (1772-1838) was a student of Bichat and Pinel, head of the Hôpital Val de grâce in Paris, professor at the medical faculty and inspector of public health. He was a member of the Académie  de  médécine founded  in  1823  and  of  the Académie  des  sciences  morales  et  politiques from  1832 onwards. He wrote extensively on the relation between the history of philosophy and the history of medicine. He had an influence comparable to Cousin's whom he was constantly challenging in public. 4\n\nwinners.  The  second  approach,  which  might  be  rewarded  and  result  in  the  dissertation's publication, on condition of revision, would be to find ways to revise spiritualism by means of theoretical tools found outside the official doctrine of Descartes, while still remaining within the  sphere  of  Cartesianism.  Here,  I  study  the  dissertation  and  subsequent  philosophical development written by a candidate of the second variety, namely Francisque Bouillier (18131899). Bouillier was situated at the heart of the French Academic institution throughout his entire  career.  He  was  admitted  to  the École  Normale  Supérieure in  1837.  He  obtained  his agrégation in 1837 and doctorate in 1839. He was professor at the Collège d'Orléans in 18371839, then at the Faculty of Letters in Lyon, where he was the dean from 1849 to 1864. He was  rector  of  the  Academy  of  Clermont-Ferrand  in  1864  and  general  inspector  of  public instruction from 1864 to 1867. From 1871 to 1876, he directed the École Normale Supérieure . He was elected to the Académie des sciences morales et politiques in  1875  and  became its president in 1889.\n\nRochoux summarizes very neatly what Bouillier's intentions were when submitting a dissertation for the 1839 competition:\n\nAfter  reporting  the  grueling  judgment,  the  Ferney  patriarch  passes  on  Cartesianism ( Dict. Philosophique ),  Mr. Libri recalls how this philosophy in our days found some eloquent  defenders;  but  he sees in this 'a  reaction  that  seems  excessive  and consequently transient' ( Revue des deux mondes , September 1842, p. 742). It will not be long before his prediction is fulfilled, or rather, it already has been, according to Mr. Francisque Bouillier, one of the winners of the prize on Cartesianism. This is how this author finishes his long in-8° dedicated to the critical examination of Descartes's philosophy:  'As  a  system  of  philosophy, Cartesianism  is  dead ,  but  it  has  left  deep traces  of  its  passage  in  the  sciences,  for  it  has  given  nineteenth-century  French philosophy its method and some of its principal results. Cartesianism is dead, but its spirit lives in us, it is the very spirit of science, philosophy and modern civilization' ( Histoire et critique de la revolution cartésienne , p. 442 and 443). Considering that a dead system lives on in spirit is one of those ingenious feats that only spiritualism is capable of. They have nothing to learn from Roland, who said of his famous mare: 'Indeed, she is dead, but she has no other flaw I can think of' (Arioste, Roland furieux , t. II, c. XXX, p. 426, in Rochoux, -1843- 112-113, note 2).\n\nFor  Bouillier,  reviving  the  'spirit'  of  Cartesianism  involved  careful  work  on  the  central figures of the Cartesian  philosophy  but  wholly  contextualized  within  institutionalized Cousinian spiritualism.\n\nIn his Histoire de la philosophie cartésienne ,  Bouillier presented a duel between the official  Descartes  and  the  Leibniz  of  the Monadology .  This  duel  was,  however,  constantly undercut by a subtler, dialogical  relation  between  the  official  Descartes,  the  Leibniz  of  the Monadology , and the Leibniz of minute perceptions. In order to understand how and why, we must read Bouillier's later work, including his generally overlooked text from 1862, the Du principe  vital  et  de  l'âme  pensante,  ou  Examen  des  diverses  doctrines  médicales  et psychologiques sur les rapports de l'âme et de la vie . 5 This last book should be understood in the  context  of  a  controversy  between,  on  the  one  hand,  the  heirs  of  Maine  de  Biran 6 and certain spiritualist physicians reviving animism, and, on the other, the Cousinians who were staunchly  opposed  to  anything  that  had  even  a  remote  resemblance  to  pantheism.  But  in  a context where King Cousin was dethroned and aging, should we interpret Bouillier's 'third way' as a concession to, or an attack against, those adversaries of Cousinianism?\n\n## 3. The Histoire de la philosophie cartésienne (1839-1854)\n\nThe Histoire  de  la  philosophie  cartésienne is  a  work  that  a  great  many  Descartes  scholars continue  to  refer  to  today.  The  work  on  the  vital  principle,  in  contrast,  has  been  largely forgotten.  In  order  to  highlight  the  most  significant  changes  between  the Histoire  de  la philosophie cartésienne and the text on the vital principle, I here refer to the second, amended edition of Bouilliers's dissertation, published in 1842 under the title Histoire et critique de la revolution cartésienne . Incidentally, this is also the text that Rochoux refers to. I will consider in what respects the Cousinian institutional and conceptual framework constrained Bouillier's\n\n5 This text is the revised and considerably augmented version (420 pages) of a dissertation of about 60 pages submitted in 1858 titled De l'unité de l'âme pensante et du principe vital.\n\n6\n\nOn the return of Maine de Biran's doctrine and of Leibniz's dynamical doctrine on the scene of the\n\nFrench  universities  from  1840  onward,  see  Janet  (1873):  365-69.  Janet  includes  in  this  movement  Jouffroy,\n\nRavaisson, Vacherot and even Saisset. Biran died in 1824. It should be recalled here that Lainé, a close friend of\n\nBiran and the executor of his testament, put Cousin in charge of examining and editing the papers he had in his possession.  Among  these  documents,  Cousin  had  the\n\nExamen des leçons de philosophie de M. Laromiguière\n\n(which had already been published in 1817), the 1819 text on Leibniz (\n\nExposition de la doctrine philosophique de Leibniz\n\n), and the manuscript\n\nNouvelles considérations sur les rapports du physique et du moral\n\n, a work that had received a prize from the Academy of Copenhagen and the 'great importance' of which Cousin stressed\n\nwhen  publishing  it  for  the  first  time  in  1834  along  with  the  other  two  texts.  Cousin  was  accused  of  having deliberately  delayed  (for  more  than  ten  years!)  the  publication  of  the  papers  he  had  in  his  possession  and  of\n\nhaving censured them when he did finally publish them. The affair is recounted in Leroux (1842): 293. This heavy context  weighed  upon  all  attempts  at  rehabilitating  Biran's  duo-dynamism,  that  it  is  to  say,  his  theory regarding the two sources of vital phenomena: the active I and the unknown vital, animal force.\n\nattempts at becoming more autonomous and the concrete effects this had in his texts. I thus show how the logic of Bouillier's philosophical thought is tightly linked to the history of his philosophical thought.\n\nWhen  rewriting  his Histoire  de  la  philosophie  cartésienne in  view  of  publication, Bouillier found himself in a double-bind. On the one hand, he had to yield to the pressure of Victor Cousin and Jean-Philibert Damiron 7 who both required that he put more stress on the metaphysical questions and their foundational character in the Cartesian tree of knowledge. Consequently, he should stress the distinction between the soul and the body. 8 On the other Bouillier  himself  wanted  to  point  out  those  things  which,  in  the  institutionally  dominant representation or image of Descartes, remained too 'abstract' or too 'pure' for him  to give right answers to the 'empirical philosophers.' Bouillier was thus tempted to stress the union of soul and the body while diminishing the passive dimension of the soul. But yielding to that temptation would oblige him to reattribute a kind of activity to the Cartesian soul. However, after having, at first, stressed spontaneity as being at the heart of causation, the latter being inseparable  from  the  notion  of  substance,  Cousin  now  described  this  notion  of  activity  as leading on a slippery slope toward pantheism since it 'gathers all the material and spiritual phenomena in a single, simple and indivisible subject in which all the diverse laws of nature are fulfilled.' 9\n\nWhat results from this intellectual tension in Bouillier's text is a reading of Descartes that, at the same time, presents him as the best dualist metaphysician of all and also as he who neglected  the  activity  or  force  of  the  soul.  For  a  significant  example,  let  us  consult  the following passage:\n\nOne must reproach Descartes for having made the notion of spirituality foreign to the notion of force, for having underestimated the essential activity of the soul, and for\n\n7 Jean-Philibert  Damiron  (1794-1862)  became  a  member  of  the Académie  des  sciences  morales  et politiques in 1836 and obtained the chair in modern history at the Sorbonne in 1838. Victor Cousin put him in charge of writing up the reports on the dissertations presented at the 1839 competition. Damiron was the author of an Essai d'histoire de la philosophie en France au dix-neuvième siècle (1828) and an Essai sur l'histoire de la philosophie  en  France  au  dix-septième  siècle (1846).  His  report  on  the  dissertations  on  Cartesianism  was published in the introduction of the second book.\n\n8 For details regarding the revisions required by Damiron, see Antoine-Mahut, 2015 (forthcoming), 2 et 3 : ' With regard to Bouillier, Damiron cleverly stresses a proximity between Locke and Descartes, in relation to the theory of the soul's passivity (see Jean-Philibert Damiron, Essai sur l'histoire de la philosophie en France au XVII e siècle (Paris, 1846) 50-52.\n\n9 Cousin (1841) 11 e Leçon, 88. On the evolution of Cousin's position on pantheism from his first classes from 1815 to their reformulation in the Histoire  générale  de  la  philosophie  depuis  les  temps  les  plus  reculés jusqu'à la fin du XVIIIe siècle (1863), see Moreau (1978): 327-331; (1979): 85-94; (1980): 85-97; (1983): 542548; (1988): 215-232; Vermeren (1990): 167-180; Macherey, (1985): 215-16; Cotten,  (2005) 231-42.\n\nhaving defined it by its action rather than by its essence when defining it by thought alone. But we cannot grasp thinking without a subject, nor can we grasp any of the soul's  phenomena  without  an  active  principle,  without  a  force  producing  them. (Bouillier, Histoire de la philosophie cartésienne -Paris/Lyon, 1854-, 65-66).\n\nThis  problem  expands  into  a  general  underestimation  of  created  substances  that  puts Descartes  on  the  slippery  slope  towards  the  phenomenalization  of  the  soul's  thoughts. Consequently,  Descartes  was  left  in  the  mercy  of  those  physicians  among  Bouillier's contemporaries  who  also  took  an  interest  in  philosophy  in  its  official  and  institutional dimension, and who wanted, either to simply get rid of Descartes in order to establish a kind of  materialist  monism,  or  use  mechanism  in  order  to  transform  Descartes  himself  into  a materialist. Phenomenalizing the soul's thoughts consists in considering them independently of  their  substratum.  And  from  considering  them  as  independent  from  this  substratum  to completely removing the latter, there is only a short step-a step that leads from empirical psychology  to  monist  materialism.  The  dangers  that  Cousin  had  underlined  regarding pantheism showed up in Descartes himself. It thus appears as if, by reason of the institutional hold that Cousin's 'passive' Descartes had in France, attributing activity to a soul united with the body would require getting rid of Descartes altogether. Or said in other words: granting activity to the Cartesian soul would amount to a disavowal of Cousin himself.\n\nSuch a conflict appears very clearly in the treatment Bouillier reserves for a text much underestimated by Cousin, the treatise on the Passions de l'âme ( ibid ., chap. V, livre I).\n\nAfter making the soul pure thinking, Descartes should have understood the passions as pure phenomena of the body, but since he did not dare to be that rigorous, he limited himself to making the soul's contributions as small as possible, and to relating them almost exclusively to the body and the animal souls, the great material agent by means of which he explains their generation and all their movements ( ibid ., 111-112).\n\nThis somatic interpretation of the passions as a unitary phenomenon culminates, in the second part  of  the Histoire ,  in  a  partial  reading  of  Descartes's  enumeration  of  the  passions.  While recognizing the importance of the principal 'ways' in which the soul relates  to  an  exterior object  in  the  phenomenon of passion, Bouillier maintains that the criterion's distinguishing phenomenon  resides  in  the  'impression'  that  these  objects  make  on  the brain .  Instead  of being placed on the side of a soul united to a body ,  the question of the passions' 'primacy' thus remains on the side of the body alone :\n\n[…] it is in the temperament of the body, in the impressions on the brain, and in the objects that can act upon our senses that he places the most ordinary and most general cause  of  all  our  passions.  We  must  thus  examine  these  objects  and  the  various impressions  that  they  can  make  upon  us,  in  order  to  arrive  at  the  most  complete classification possible of the soul's passions. Even though they are innumerable, they only  affect  us  in  a  certain  number  of  ways,  following  whether  they  hurt  us  or  are profitable for us. For there are only as many primary and primitive passions, as there are basic ways in which our senses can be moved by an object ( ibid .).\n\nWhat the Cousinian framework prevents Bouillier from stressing, and which in turn justifies the  contradictions  and  insufficiencies  that  he  imputes  on  Descartes,  is  thus  the  inner  sense specific to the passions of the soul .  The impossibility of formulating such passions becomes manifest once again towards the end of the chapter, where Bouillier establishes an opposition between the passions of the body and the emotions of the soul:\n\nTo the passions of the body must be opposed the inner emotions or passions of the soul, that is to say, those passions that are aroused in the soul by the soul itself and not by some movement of the animal spirits. Happiness and misery in our lives depend on these emotions in particular, since they touch us more closely. Often they are joined with  corporeal  passions  that  correspond  to  them,  but  equally  often  they  meet  with those that are contrary to them, and which serve to counterbalance them ( ibid .).\n\nOne ultimate and ingenious way of justifying such an approach, while still maintaining the pertinence  of  the  dualist  interpretation  that  Cousin  inflicts  upon  the  recalcitrant  Cartesian texts, consists in suggesting that this was the solution Descartes himself proposed in relation to  the  scholastics.  Cousin's  obsessive  fear  of  pantheism  would  then  be  nothing  but  the counterpart  of  Descartes's  struggle  against  hylomorphism.  And  this  double-bind,  between pantheism and hylomorphism, makes it impossible to conceptualize 'the true nature of the animal' within the Cartesian framework alone.\n\n[…] we should take care to notice that this hypothesis regarding the animal-machine stands in a close relation to the rest of Descartes's philosophy. It is not only tied to the totality of his physiology, but to the fundamental principles of his metaphysics. After having fixed the human soul exclusively in its conscious thought of itself, outside of which  there  is  nothing  but  material  and  inert  extension,  after  having  deprived  the creatures of all force and all causation and turned God into the sole force and efficient cause, where could he possibly find the principles of life and sentiment to animate the beasts? Since, according to his system, he cannot possibly give them any active force, he ought necessarily to conceive of them as pure inert matter, subjected to the general laws  of  movement.  This  is  the  link  between  the  automatism  of  beasts  and  the metaphysics of Descartes. The true nature of the animal must be reestablished against Descartes ( ibid ., 156-157).\n\nThe constraints that the Cousinian framework imposed on Bouillier's reception of Descartes had  two  consequences.  On  the  one  hand,  Descartes  was  pulled  in the direction of occasionalism, depriving creatures of all activity. On the other, Bouillier finds himself forced to turn to Leibniz, and more precisely to the Monadology , in order to conceptualize this lack of activity: 'It is by means of Leibniz that we will correct Descartes' ( ibid ., 136) .\n\nThe difficulty at this point, in 1854, is claiming a Leibnizian heritage while avoiding completely dismissing Descartes. He must satisfy Cousin who was in the middle of revising his Fragments  de  philosophie  cartésienne and  did  not  overlook  any  of  the  successive developments  of  Bouillier's  dissertation.  On  this  point,  Bouillier  prudently  opts  for  a quantifying formula that leaves in place a small margin for 'reform':\n\nDoubtless  one  is  allowed  to  give  this  designation  [i.e.  reformed  Cartesianism]  to  a philosophy about which it can be said, with Mr. Cousin, that is three-quarters that of Descartes (Bouillier, Histoire , 405). 10\n\nBut  what  does  the  remaining  quarter  consist  in?  A  Leibnizian  reform  of  the  notion  of substance.  Leibniz  reintegrates  force  and  activity  into  the  essence  of  substance  without however  going  back  to  'the  naked  force  of  scholasticism.'  ( ibid .,  411) . By  replacing substantial  extension  with  monads  he,  'finally,'  replaces  the  outdated  notions  of  the\n\n10 Bouillier develops his general analysis of Leibniz in volume II (chapters 17-19 are explicitly dedicated to Leibniz.)\n\nscholastics that Descartes had been right to reject. But he also rejects something that, when described in these terms, can no longer be described as a merely anecdotal 'quarter,' namely Descartes's  own  metaphysics.  Bouillier  uses  a  detour  via  occasionalism  to  describe  this metaphysics in the very same terms as those Cousin used to describe the dangers of pantheism and Spinozism:\n\nBy  correcting  the  fundamental  error  of  Cartesianism,  he  also  finds  the  remedy  for Spinozism.  Here  we  finally  have  real  and  persistent  substances  that  are  as  different from the phenomena as they are from the infinite substance itself, and not just ghostly substances without consistence or action that are absorbed into the true cause and the unique  true  substance.  If  there  are  no  such  substances,  there  are  no  obstacles  to pantheism.  Without  monads,  as  Leibniz  says  it  very  well,  Spinoza  would  be  right ( ibid ).\n\nBouillier reproached Descartes for thinking man as a soul distinct from a body with which no real,  effective  synergy  is  possible.  To  this,  he  now  opposed  a  Leibniz  who,  by  way  of reaction,  reaffirmed  the  'indissoluble  union  of  the  soul  with  its  organs.'  ( ibid .,  433).  In Leibniz, however, the theory of pre-established harmony had the disadvantage of reintroducing, within Leibniz's own system, a principle of passivity that pulls Leibniz toward occasionalism  and  runs  counter  to  the  principles  of  the  monadology:  'There  is  thus  a  true contradiction between the essential principles of monadology and pre-established harmony, in such a way that it seems necessary to sacrifice pre-established harmony in order to save the monad.' ( ibid .,  473) . When defending the notion of pre-established harmony, Leibniz is as close to a Descartes incapable of conceptualizing action as he is to a Malebranche inclining towards Spinoza. What is lacking in both occasionalism-including Cartesian occasionalism-and pre-established harmony is a veritable notion of activity.\n\nIn  1854,  the  winner  of  the  competition  thus  found  himself  in  an  impasse.  Descartes was  too  much  of  a  support  for  the  system  he  was  fighting.  But  if  the  very  definition  of Cartesianism  would  have  to  be  changed,  and  if  official  Cartesianism  was  too  dominant  to make  such  change  possible,  maybe  it  was  time  to  kill  Rochoux's  mare  and  renounce  on Cartesianism altogether? And if there was truth be found on the side of Leibniz, maybe one should in fact return more decisively to him. But this would have to be done in such a way that it allowed the conceptualization of a new animism without any risk of materialism and pantheism, and consequently by downplaying if not outright rejecting the passivity reintroduced by the by Leibnizian conception of pre-established harmony. In the Histoire de la philosophie cartésienne , Bouillier only hinted at his solution to the problem once. Hence, while speaking of Leibniz and of some future project not yet realized, he upholds the ideal of a 'doctrine of the unitary principle of life and thought.' ( ibid ., 422). But what this referred to was not a simple return to Leibniz. It was rather a personal position that Bouillier adopted in a contemporary intellectual debate about animism. Leibniz, in other words, was nothing but a means to intervene in this debate.\n\n## 4. The return of animism of the philosophical and medical scene (1850-1860)\n\nIn the context of the debates on animism, it is important to note that most participants claimed Cousin's authority, or that they all attempted to align Cousin's position with their own. As an example, I take the discussions around the Introduction à la philosophie medicale by Richard de Laprade. This dissertation, presented to the Academy of Lyon in July 1860 shortly before Laprade's death and subsequently published by his son under the title Animisme et vitalisme , 11 defends  the  animist  position  adopted  by  the  physicians  of  the  Montpellier  School  against Bouillier. He described the commotion Bouillier had occasioned among organicist physicians, even among those who were supporters of the Cousinian school. The organicists were those physicians, spiritualist or not, who believed that the consideration of organic life should be put at the heart of the reflection on the nature of the soul. He also cited statements by Cousin seemingly going in the direction of animism and organicism:\n\nMr.  Cousin's  opinion  is  even  more  explicit:  'My  conviction  is  that  under  these different organs there is a force that makes them act and concur towards life; a force that,  when  the  exercise  of  the  functions  has  been  upset,  will  intervene  by  means  of external  stimuli  and  internal  affections  and  reestablishes  more  or  less  the  harmony among the functions, or even the workings of each function. At all times, some force has been admitted, be it obscurely and by means of designations that were more or less precise, such as Plato's appetitive soul , Aristotle's sensitive soul , or the conserving or mediating soul evoked by certain more modern physiologists. It is a force that cannot be denied, on pains of falling into the kind of crude materialism that only sees organs in the body, or loosing oneself in a subtle and chimerical spiritualism that confounds\n\nthe  vital  principle  with  the  principle  of  spiritual  life  itself  (Laprade, Animisme  et vitalisme, 4).\n\nResponding  to  Laprade  in  the  1862  version  of  his  dissertation,  Bouillier  blew  his  own Couinian  cover.  First,  Bouillier  argued,  Laprade  reported  only  oral  statements 12 that  were published  nowhere  by  Cousin.  There  was  thus  nothing  to  guarantee  their  authenticity. Secondly, there was surely one text where Cousin praised animism, namely in his edition of the Phaedo .  But  this  remained  indirect  praise  stated  in  the  context  of  the  examination  of  a philosophy other than his own, namely Platonism. Consequently, there were concerns about intellectual  honesty  in  relation  to  Laprade's  reading,  warranting  the  greatest  prudence  in relation to his account of Cousin's position: 'It is more exact to say that, to our regret, Mr. Cousin has not treated in any particular way this question on which he could have enlightened us, as he has on a great many others' (Bouillier, 1862, 297). 13 In fact, Cousin had discussed animism with Bouillier on a prior occasion. But the replies Cousin had given did not really have a bearing on the truth of the doctrine. They highlighted the 'advantages' of the thesis, namely its greater ability to ward off the materialist enemy than Maine de Biran's brand of animism.  Cousin's  reply  to  Bouillier  was  thus  situated  on  a strategic terrain  and  did  not concern his personal position. But importantly it did not indicate how to take into account the organicist position:\n\nI must admit that your opinion regarding the identification of the principle of life and thought  does  not  appeal  to  me,  accustomed  as  I  am  to  judge  the  principles  by  the phenomena  which  are  here  entirely  different.  Moreover,  I  do  not  really  see  the advantages  of  this  delicate  discussion  for  the  present  state  of  philosophy.  It  is important that we focus our forces on the points under threat, including the spirituality of the soul and the essential distinction between God and the world (Latreille -1907, 226-27. The letter is dated 15 November 1859).\n\nBouillier responded to Cousin in the very first line of the new preface of Du principe vital et de l'âme pensante :\n\n12\n\nWhat Laprade had in mind was probably the unpublished seminars on consciousness from 1819-1820. They can be consulted in the manuscript collection of Cousin's writings at the library of the Sorbonne. 13 Regarding the argument from the Phaedon , in connection with Stahl, see Ibid. chap. V, 73.\n\n- […] how temerarious it is pretending to overturn the doctrine of the soul's duality and of  life  established  so  solidly  by  Maine  de  Biran  and  by  Jouffroy  within  spiritualist philosophy and wanting to rehabilitate-and this not without risks for the spirituality of  the  soul-the  universally  rejected  animist  hypothesis!  How  imprudent,  in  these times, to  present  to  sceptics  and  materialists  the  pleasant  spectacle  of  serious dissidence  among  the  spiritualist  philosophers!  We  reply,  first  of  all,  that  it  is  a question of truth and not tactics; and besides, it is my firm conviction that the doctrine I  would  like  to  triumph  would  result  in  the  strengthening  and  not  the  downfall  of spiritualism (Bouillier, Du principe vital et de l'âme pensante , Preface, VI-VII). 14\n\nBouillier's objective in the second revised version of the book on the vital principle was thus to show the way in which animism, while promoting a doctrine that unified the soul and the vital principle, allowed him to respond to the organicists, both spiritualist and non-spiritualist, better than the followers of Biran could do.\n\n## 5. Cousinian constraints on the Du principe vital et de l'âme pensante\n\nBouillier's classes at the Faculty of Letters in Lyon-classes that formed the basis for his last publications-were dedicated to this question regarding the unity of the vital principle and the thinking soul. He presented a first summary of this work to the Academie des science morales et politiques , and then published it in 1858. Subsequently, he continued to work on it, after it provoked  heated  discussions  not  only  with  the  medical  schools  and  in  particular  with  the organicists, but also within his own spiritualist camp.\n\nThe terms of the debate thus changed between the history of Cartesian philosophy and the  dissertation  on  the  vital  principle.  While  Cousin  placed  Bouillier  in  an  antagonistic position  in  relation  to  the  physicians,  Bouillier  now  came  to  share  terrain  with  them.  The spiritualist reflection on  the soul  did  not  exclude a priori every  possible organicist consideration.  In  order  to  negotiate  that  terrain  theoretically,  Bouillier  constantly  produced bifurcations in theories that Cousin presented as uniform. He thus has a double Descartes, a double  Leibniz,  a  double  spiritualism,  a  double  organicism,  etc.  Each  of  these  Descartes, Leibniz, spiritualism, organicism, reflect and refract the constraints of the institutions that he\n\n14 The original version of the dissertation even spoke of this as a 'family quarrel' (see -1858- 5). Hence, corresponding with Cousin brought Bouillier to reconsider or least render more explicit the relation between the 'family quarrel' and the 'battle against materialism.'\n\ntakes  part  in.  These  multiple  bifurcations  are  characteristic  and  original  in  Bouillier's readings,  making  him  stand  out  as  someone  who  always  proposed  a  'third  way.'  One  can identify three discursive, conceptual or even political strategies, aiming at cleverly circumventing  the  Cousinian  constraints.  I  here  list  them  in  an  order  going  from  the  most polemical to the most conciliatory: 1/ a strategy that inverts the Cousinian project itself and which consists in relating the defects of Cartesianism to abusive organicism. 2/ a strategy that consists in showing that, in Descartes, those defects stem from the firm stance he had to adopt in  the  polemics  opposing  him  to  the  scholastics.  3/  Finally,  a  strategy  that  consists  in associating himself with the most orthodox among the Cousinians, namely Damiron. Let us consider these three strategies one by one.\n\nThe strategy of inversion. The text on the vital principle is original in relation to the dissertation on Descartes in that it makes use of an argument, found among most empiricist thinkers from the time of Descartes and the physiologists of the nineteenth century, according to which Cartesian mechanism leaves vacant a whole theoretical area that needs explaining, namely that of vital phenomena. Among Descartes's contemporaries, Bouillier in particular refers to a letter where Descartes comments on the first physiological theses of the Utrecht physician  Regius,  reproaching  him  for  not  having  gone  far  enough  in  his  mechanical explanation of life and having left 'a greater difference between living and non-living things than between a clock and any other automaton' (For the texts by Descartes quoted here, see Victor  Cousin, Oeuvres  de  Descartes (Paris,  1824-1826)  vol.  8,  628).  This  passage  is emblematic of the Cartesian excess, but it also indicated that mechanism had to be corrected or completed when it came to vital phenomena, including for an empiricist like Regius. As for what  concerns  the  French  physicians  and  physiologists  of  the  nineteenth  century,  none  of them claimed to explain the organic functions solely by means of the laws of mechanics. And even if one appealed to the basic principle of Cartesian physiology-i.e. 'fire without light' following the expression from the Traité de l'Homme -as the constitutive element of a larger theory of the living, the following point remained patently clear: 'Among the various fires of nature  that  might  be  called  upon  to  replace  the  vital  soul,  Descartes  made  an  unfortunate choice, namely carbonic gas which is a principle of death, and not of life, as modern science has shown' ( ibid ., 175). In the revised version of Du principe vital , Bouillier attempted to pull Descartes toward the position of those physicians responsible for the progressive sidetracking of  the  soul  in  the  constitution  of  the  science  of  man,  emptying  Descartes's  doctrine  of  its spiritualist potential. Bouillier thus literally turned Cousin's project on its head: The interest of Cousin's Descartes became the contrary of what it was for Cousin.\n\nThe strategy of excess. In order to be equitable towards the Cartesian project, however, it had to be stressed that Descartes had been forced to harden his arguments in order to fight the  pernicious  effects  of  a  ruinous  kind  of  animism,  coming  at  much  too  high  a  cost  for humankind. This 'overflow of souls, in man and in nature' was emblematically expressed in the doctrine of Jan Baptist Van Helmont, whose doctrine is judged as follows:\n\nThere can be no doubt that this prodigious life of souls and intellectual faculties has contributed, along with the general principles of his metaphysics, to throw Descartes into the opposite exaggeration of mechanical physiology, the absolute negation of life and of all souls except the human ones, thus endorsing the automatism of beasts ( ibid ., 164).\n\nBut this Cartesian excess had an unfortunate effect: while animism was the prevalent system in  the  history  of  ideas  before  Descartes,  Cartesianism  had  left  such  a  powerful  imprint  on posterity that the very term 'animism' could no longer be pronounced without immediately lending to a 'suspicion of ontology and a return to scholasticism' ( ibid ., 48). What Bouillier had to accomplish next, then, was not so much the redefining of animism, but the refutation of that  with  which  it  had  generally  been  identified  with  in  the  Cartesian  history  of  ideas,  by partisans as well as opponents of those ideas. Descartes, but also Cousin reading Descartes, had  contributed  to  the  exaggerations  attached  to  the  term  'animism,'  but  without  such exaggeration being strategically ungrounded.\n\nThe  strategy  of  appending. In  order  to  balance  his  project,  Bouillier  took  a  final precaution which was strategically very clever: He identified an ally among the Cousinians who had tried to stay in the background: Jean-Philibert Damiron, and in particular his Rapport sur le concours sur la philosophie de Leibniz ,  published in 1860. It  was Damiron who had asked  Bouillier  to  reorient  his  first  work  towards  Descartes  the  metaphysician.  In  his  own Essai sur la philosophie en France au XVIIe siècle (1846), he had expressed scruples about Leibniz.  These  scruples  were  expressed  at  the  time  when  Leibniz's  philosophy  had  been chosen as the topic for the essay competition of the Académie .  This in itself testified to the actuality current relevance and the importance of the Hanover philosopher. Influenced by the dissertations  written  by  Nourrisson  and  Foucher  de  Careil 15 ,  Damiron  underlined  what,  for\n\n15 Cousin's 'verbal report' on this dissertation for the Académie des sciences morales et politiques dates from 1854. It was published in Leibniz, Descartes et Spinoza. Avec un Rapport par M. V. Cousin (Paris, 1862), an  augmented  version  of  Louis  Alexandre  Foucher  de  Careil's Réfutation  inédite  de  Spinoza  par  Leibniz. Précédée  d'un  mémoire  par  Louis  Alexandre  Foucher  de  Careil (Paris,  1854).  Jean-Félix  Nourrisson's La\n\nhim,  constituted  the  most  pertinent  aspect  of  Leibniz's  dynamics,  namely  the  way  it reintroduced a notion of force that was neither materialist nor 'purely' spiritualist. Leibniz, 'who does not always tell us all he does or how he does it,' had drawn his argumentation from  the  science  of  the  soul,  not  from  his  conception  of  God  or  matter  ( ibid .,  48). 16 This aspect of Damiron's reading of Leibniz was crucial for Bouillier, but it also helps to clarify the  kind  of  obstacle  Bouillier  was  facing  specifically  when  revising  his  dissertation  on  the vital principle. This obstacle concerned not only Cartesianism or animism, but the complex relation between the two theories that stand out when they are refracted in the prism of the institutionally  dominant  Cartesianism:  'The  false  notion  of  the  soul  endorsed  by  Descartes [we  must  here  understand:  by  Cousin's  Descartes]:  that  is  the  principal  cause  for  the resistance that animism today encounters in French philosophy' ( ibid ., 319).\n\nFinally, we must consider one of the most important readings of Leibniz at the time, namely the one proposed by Albert Lemoine who read Leibniz through the eyes of Georg Ernst Stahl, a pietist physician who had engaged in an acrid controversy with Leibniz on the question of vitalism and pre-established harmony, subsequently published by Stahl in 1720 under the title Negotium otiosum ('A tiresome quarrel'). 17 Once we understand the interest of Lemoine's text on Stahl for Bouillier, we can better grasp the interpretation and rehabilitation of Leibniz that he proposes as a response to Lemoine without however ever losing sight of Cousin.\n\nIn  France,  Stahl  had  become  central  to  contemporary  philosophico-medical  debates, and the way he was read is telling of the confusion that ruled when it came to the meaning of the  term  'animism.'  For  certain  commentators,  Stahl  had  simply  replaced  Jan  Baptist  Van Helmont's archeus with the rational soul. For others, he was mainly influenced by Descartes, Malebranche and, more generally, by doctrines about the passivity of matter. Indeed, Stahl's work represented a kind of indeterminate polemical reference that everyone gave a meaning to  according  to  their  needs.  Probably  for  this  very  reason,  Stahl  was  at  the  heart  of  the academic  debates.  Maine  de  Biran  was  the  first  to  recognize  his  importance. 18 After  him,\n\nPhilosophie de Leibniz (Paris, 1860) was published with a quotation attributed to Cousin on the cover: 'Leibniz is the last and greatest Cartesian.'\n\n16 Bouillier  refers  to  Leibniz  as  an  ally  from  very  early  on,  referencing  Leibniz's De  ipsa  vi  naturae insita, included in the Erdmann edition: '[…] the first science of force is not truly mechanics or physics but, as Mr. Damiron has pointed out [in the report for the Académie des sciences morales et politiques regarding the competition on Leibniz's philosophy], but psychology.' ( ibid. , 18). 17\n\nStahl\n\n(1720).\n\n18 See  Biran  (1819).  This  text  had  been  written  between  April  and  July  1819  and  was  intended  for Michaud's Biographie universelle . Biran describes Stahl's physiology as the key theory that would allow for the alleviation  of  the  indetermination  of  the  Cartesian  doctrine  of  innate  knowledge  and  the  reconciliation  of Descartes and Locke (see for example Ibid. 20).\n\nStahl  was  talked  about  in  Paris.  Bouillier  notes,  for  example,  the  influence  of  the  doctoral thesis by Ernest-Charles Lasègue from 1846, De Stahl et de sa doctrine médicale . At the same time, Stahl's work was translated in Montpellier.\n\nThe most important vindication of Stahl was, however, proposed by Albert Lemoine, a professor  of  philosophy  at  the  Faculty  of  Letters  in  Bordeaux,  in  his  dissertation Stahl  et l'animisme of  which  the  Academy  published  a  summary  in  July  and  August  1858.  This dissertation was doubly important for Bouillier. 19 First,  it  provided him with the conceptual means to deconstruct the modern, pejorative understanding of animism. Next, it obliged him to revise his own position in the book on Le principe vital , taking into account the objections that Lemoine made to him in a second version of his work, published in 1864 under the title Le Vitalisme et l'animisme de Stahl. 20 The difference between the titles of the two versions of Lemoine's text alone testifies to what was at stake. In the first version, Lemoine's aim was to justify Stahl and revise the meaning of the 'label' of animism. In the second version, on the contrary, he wanted to situate himself in relation to animism, and in particular question the relation it upholds to vitalism. These discussions of Stahl thus served to outline the contours of a new animism that Lemoine had contributed to rehabilitate without, however, subscribing to  it,  but  that  Bouillier  now  wanted  to  see  become  dominant  within  institutionalized spiritualism. 21\n\nFrom  there  on  we  can  distinguish  yet  another  two  strategies.  First,  Bouillier  found arguments  in  favor  of  animism  in  Lemoine's  dissertation,  or  rather  an  alternative  way  of dissociating  animist  explanations  from  the  pejorative  image  that  had  haunted  them  since Descartes.  Next,  he  employed  and  modified  those  arguments  for  his  own  purposes  by engaging  in  a  deeper  enquiry  into  Leibniz,  in  particular  on  the  question  of  insensible perceptions. Let us take a look at each of these two points.\n\nThe importance of Lemoine's dissertation for Bouillier was, first, that it put into focus a kind of double interpretive maneuver the effect of which had been to deprive Stahl of all originality: While the Cartesian reception of animism had reduced it to the caricatures of Van Helmont,  Parcelsus,  Fludd  and  Boehme,  the  Leibnizian  reception  of  Stahl  had  reduced  his animism to materialism. Stahl, however, had in reality proposed a true alternative (Lemoine calls  it  'an  intermediary  system')  to  both  mechanism  and  dynamics.  His  animism  could  in\n\n19 Bouillier summarized his debt to Lemoine as follows: 'I have made use of the excellent analysis of this polemics that Mr. Lemoine has provided in his dissertation on Stahl.' ( ibidem ., 204).\n\n20 Albert Lemoine, L'Animisme et le vitalisme de Stahl (Paris, 1864).\n\n21 Cousin himself called for such a confrontation (see Cousin to Bouillier, 8 November 1858, in Latreille, Francisque Bouillier , 226).\n\nthis  sense  be  considered  radically  new,  in  philosophy  as  well  as  in  physiology.  In  order  to show that, one would however first have to dissociate Stahl from Descartes. More precisely, one had to dissociate him from a dualist and occasionalist Descartes, a Descartes who had championed  the  passivity  of  both  the  soul  and  the  body.  This  would  permit  granting  the soul-and only the soul-a certain dynamism, by way of juxtaposing Stahl's position to the doctrine of pre-established harmony and its shortcomings, stressed by Bouillier in his 1854 Histoire . Next, Stahl's animism should be rationalized, by being correlated with experimental results and with the struggle against abstract hypotheses. In this context, attributing life to the rational soul became the natural consequence of an unwillingness to multiply secondary and chimerical causes, archeuses and genies of all kinds. In summary, Lemoine incited his readers to revise the 'labels' used by the nascent historiography of the life sciences and attempted to liberate the field of animism for this new science.\n\nIn chapter VIII of Du principe vital et de l'âme pensante, Bouillier analyses the major differences  between  Stahl's  spiritualism  and  'that  of  Descartes  and  the  psychologists  who separate  the  organic  functions  from  thought  and  will  in  order  to  refer  them  to  another principle' (Bouillier, Du principe vital et de l'âme pensante , op. cit ., chap. VIII, p. 152).  He complemented  this  analysis  with  a  polemical  study  of  Leibniz.  Lemoine  had  questioned Leibniz's role in the identification of Stahl as a 'materialist,' and thus in the association of Stahl to the 'thousand-headed' monster that Cousin was chasing. Lemoine's aim, however, was  to  show  that  if  Leibniz  did  indeed  attack  Stahl,  he  did  not  reject  him  entirely.  When attacking  Stahl,  Leibniz  only  aimed  at  exhibiting  those  doctrinal  elements  which, in  an animism Leibniz otherwise subscribed to , contradicted the theory of pre-established harmony. Moreover, instead of only criticizing  the  idea  according  to  which  the  soul  directs  not  only voluntary movement but also the organic functions, Leibniz made the mistake of attacking generally the idea of the interaction between body and soul. He mistakenly took all notions of soul-body interaction-a notion that is not Cartesian if one insists upon making of Descartes an occasionalist-to be materialist. At the same time, Leibniz had reinforced the element of passivity  in  pre-established  harmony,  hereby  compromising  the  monadology. 22 In  sum,  by insisting  on  pre-established  harmony,  Leibniz  lost  what  the  monadology  had  gained  him, namely the activity of the soul. Stahl, on the contrary, used that gain and brought out its full potential:\n\nStahl  is  indeed  a  true  […]  spiritualist,  but,  reflecting  with  his  common  sense  along with the rest of the world, he thinks that the spiritual soul is nevertheless capable of moving the body. This is the crime that author of the pre-established harmony cannot forgive him' ( ibid ., 163).\n\nHence,  according  to  Lemoine,  a  well-conceived  animism  did  not  give  rise  to  materialism. Quite to the contrary, it had as its condition sine qua non the immateriality of the soul. Stahl 'brings  spiritualism  down  to  the  level  of  medicine,  to  the  advantage  of  medicine  and  of philosophy  itself.'  ( ibid .,  187).  He  went  further  than  Leibniz  who  remained  Cartesian  or occasionalist, according to the typology established by Bouillier in his Histoire .\n\nThe importance of Lemoine's dissertation for Bouillier's project should now be clear. But Bouillier still had another two problems to deal with. First, he had to displace the main foyer of animism from medicine to the history of philosophy. This required downplaying the element that Lemoine had shown to play an overwhelmingly strong role, namely Cartesian mechanism,  which  had  helped  legitimize  materialist  re-appropriations  of  Descartes  in  both medicine and philosophy. But it also involved removing flaws in Stahl's animism. Next, in order to remain at the heart of eclecticism and to make his position acceptable to the dominant psychological spiritualism, he had to make Leibniz triumph over Stahl in the end, or show how Leibniz correctly imported lessons learned from Stahl into philosophy. Let us consider these two points.\n\nBouillier first explained that by appealing to the soul, insofar as it knows and reasons, when  explaining  the  interplay  of  the  organs,  and  in  particular  when  establishing  all  the functions of life, Stahl himself remained too Cartesian. What had to be reused and valued in Leibniz was the theory that explained the unconscious nature of vital phenomena, that is to say, the theory of insensible perceptions, of blind and deaf thoughts.\n\nReferences  to  the  cases  where  consciousness  breaks  down,  limit  cases  such  as lethargy, apoplexy or even childhood, had been at the heart of the organicist argument. In his Nouvelles  études  sur  le  spiritualisme ,  for  example,  Claude  Pidoux  (1869)  shows  how  the theory of insensible perception had been tested at the Académie imperiale de médécine where they experimented with induced anesthesia (by inhalation of ether or chloroform) in order to the observe what psychological phenomena occurred before, during, and after the administration of the anesthetics. Their observations did not permit identifying the brain as the  'the  organ  of  inner  sense'  (which  would  amount  to  endorsing  materialism).  They  did however  show  that anesthesia suppresses people's will and sense of unity. 23 Those experiments  suggested  that  force  should  be  resituated  on  the  side  of  matter  and,  most importantly, they showed how the spiritualist re-appropriation of animism by Bouillier was a sleight of hand. For if some force or other didn't subsist in those lethargic states, it could not originate  from  the  soul,  and  consequently  animism  as  conceived  by  Bouillier  was  proven wrong.\n\nIn  relation  to  the  question  of  consciousness,  Bouillier's  position  thus  appears  as  a veritable tour de force : he mobilizes the same argumentative framework as the one employed by the mechanist Cartesians in the physical register by holding that one cannot explain the infinite variations in the states of consciousness otherwise than by appealing to a domain of insensible  perceptions  governed  by  the  same  laws  as  the  domain  of  sensible  ones.  Taking departure in the polemics against Locke's empiricism in the Nouveaux essais sur l'entendement  humain ,  Bouillier  thus  reconceptualizes  the  Leibnizian  minute  perceptions from the viewpoint of the physicians , i.e. Bouillier's adversaries, according to an argument a fortiori :  'The  metaphysician  who  underestimates  the  reality  of  insensible  perceptions  is similar  to  the  physician  who,  when  studying  material  nature,  does  not  take  into  account imperceptible  bodies  and  insensible  movements.'  ( ibid .,  199) . This  additional  argument permits Bouillier to specify what he himself understands by 'animism': it is a doctrine that stresses  a  form  of  'inner  sense.'  Leibniz  can  thus,  at  the  same  time,  be  habilitated  and protected against all materialist or even pantheist misuse.\n\nAs such, Leibniz constituted the very last mediation needed by Bouillier in order to produce what amounted to a veritable coup de theater , although most of the preparatory work had already been done by Lemoine: Bouillier overturned the Cartesian model, but this time the dominant  one.  For  it  was  precisely  via this internal sense  that Bouillier finally rediscovered a 'good' Descartes. By means of this good Descartes he completely renewed the analyses  of  the  phenomena  of  passion  he  had  proposed  in  the Histoire  de  la  philosophie cartésienne , and even those proposed in chapter XII of the dissertation on the vital principle, dedicated to the 'transformation' of life in mechanism:\n\n[…] modern psychology has much too often forgotten the ancient theory of the inner senses,  these  senses  that  the  organs  do  not  seem  to  be  exterior  to,  and  that  do  not require that any external object be actually present. Descartes, however, and not going any  further  than  to  him,  had  noted  them  in  ancient  philosophy,  and  had  provided  a\n\n23 On this point, see ibid . 17-18.\n\nplace for  them in  his  theory  of  man.  Besides  the  external  senses,  he  allows  for  two internal senses that he defines in the following way: 'The first sense that I call interior comprises hunger, thirst and other natural appetites, and it is aroused in the soul by the nerves of the stomach, the gullet and all the other parts that serve the natural functions on account of which one has such appetites. The second comprises joy, sadness, love, anger  and  all  the  other  passions,  etc.'  The  reality  of  this  internal  sense  which according to Descartes is aroused by the movements of the stomach, the gullet and all the other parts that serve the natural functions, has been recognized by a great number of physiologists who, in general, have concerned themselves more than the psychologists with the relations of the soul with the body ( ibid ., 364-365).\n\nWhen writing this, Bouillier pointed to a whole new field of study that his spiritualist friends had ignored: that of the soul's passions, those passions upon which the morality Cousin had wished  for  relied.  The  interpretation  of  Descartes  that  Bouillier  finally  endorsed-at  the endpoint  of  a  careful  deconstruction  of  an  institutionalized  Descartes  that  had  become  so influential that no Cartesian alternative was available to critics such as Rochoux-is thus the Descartes we encounter at places in the Traité de l'homme , in the fifth part of the Discours de la  méthode ,  at  the  end  of  the  fourth  part  of  the Principes  de  la  philosophie ,  in  the correspondence, with Elisabeth in particular, and, above all, in the treatise on the Passions de l'âme . It is a Descartes conceived via a new interpretation of Leibnizianism, saved from the official Cousinianism caricatural conception of its relation to 'animism' and 'Cartesianism.'\n\n## 6. Conclusion\n\nWhat does the example of Bouillier tell us about the reception of Leibniz in France in the mid-nineteenth century? It must first be underlined that this reception remains governed by the available texts and translations, and caught up in the reception of other authors through whom it is mediated (for example in the polemics surrounding Stahl.) It is thus not Leibniz alone, or just Leibniz, who is received, but a Leibniz inserted into an intellectual constellation outside  of  which  the  various  ways  in  which  he  is  used  remain  perfectly  incomprehensible. Second, in the context of the dialogue between spiritualism and the life sciences, we note, at the same time, an increasing interest and very strong distrust with regard to the monadology. In  this  context,  the  confrontation  of  the  monadological  theses  with  other  theses  in  the\n\nLeibnizian  system  becomes  indicative  of  the  degree  of  autonomy  that  an  author  has  with regard to an institutionalized thought within which monadology has no place.\n\nMore generally,  Bouillier's  intellectual  itinerary  teaches  us  that  any  reception  of  an author or a body of texts will be biased by institutional and mediations the effects of which show  up  in  the  way  in  which  their  history  is  told.  Whether  one  chooses  to  mobilize  the Leibniz of the monadology, pre-established harmony or minute perceptions, depends on the strategies  that  one  adopts  when  entering  one's  own  intellectual  space-a  space  where  such references  already  have  several  meanings  and  fulfill  precise  functions.  In  other  words: interpretations of early modern authors are always refracted in the context of those who read them and they reflect the contemporary issues with which they are concerned, and this has consequences that can be identified and even interpreted in their texts.\n\nSecond, the references to an author do not acquire their meaning in and by themselves, but  always  in  relation  to  references  to  other  authors:  Leibniz  is  interpreted  in  relation  to interpretations of Descartes or Stahl-interpretations of Descartes and Stahl that are colored by  present-day  concerns,  that  select,  order,  and  recompose  the  doctrinal  elements  in  those authors in ways that serve the dominant cause. Bouillier's work, in short, poses the question of the 'objectivity' and the 'autonomy' of the historian of philosophy.\n\n## Acknoledgements\n\nI  am  grateful  to  Mike  Beaney,  Jeremy  Dunham,  Mogens  Laerke,  Samuel  Lézé,  Pauline Phemister and the two anonymous reviewers for their relevant and stimulant comments on the manuscript.
