I NTRODUCTION\n\nAt the beginning of his Institutions of medicine William Cullen defined ' P h y sio l o g y ,  or  the  Doctrine  of  the  Animal  Oeconomy'  as  'the doctrine  which  explains  the  conditions  of the  body  and  of the  mind necessary to life and health'.' Commenting on the same definition in his Edinburgh medical lectures in 1770, he noted that while physiologists normally discussed mental conditions  it was  not usual  to  include  the mind in the definition of  physiology. Some people had criticized him for introducing metaphysics into medicine. In response, Cullen employed a distinction which was also made by his friend David Hume, between two meanings  of 'metaphysics'.  It  can mean  'subtile  Disquisitions' :  like Hume, he wanted to avoid metaphysics in this sense. However, if by Metaphysics we understand as I think we should the Operations of the human Mind in thinking, that is, the History of the human Mind, then I say Metaphysics are unavoidable not only in Physick, but perhaps in every Science if a man goes deep.\n\nTrue metaphysics for both thinkers was concerned with 'the Mind and its  Operations' .  Cullen  saw  this  as  a particularly  important  study  in medicine because 'it is not less certain that the Conditions of the Mind do mutually affect the Body' than that 'the Conditions of the Body do affect the Mind'.^\n\nIn proposition 310!  the Institutions Cullen adopted the view that there\n\n## © John P.

For  the  friendship  between  Cullen  and  Hume,  see HL i.  163, ii. 449-50.\n\nis an immaterial mind in a living man and that all thinking is a property of this alone. However, he also insisted that this soul or mind (he used the terms  interchangeably)  is  closely  connected  with  'the  material  and corporeal part' of  man, in particular with the nervous system. While he accepted this connection as a fact, 'the mode of it we do not understand, nor pretend to explain'.  He would probably have included questions about how mind  and  body are interconnected among  the  false metaphysics which he rejected. At the end of  his 1770-71 lecture on this proposition  Cullen  mentioned  three  philosophico-theological  hypo­ theses  about  the  nature  of  this  connection-the  ancient  theory  of 'Physical  Influx',  the  doctrine  of  'occasional  Causes'  which  he ascribed to Descartes, and the 'pre-established Harmonies' theory of Leibniz.  However, he said no more about these except that there are 'Difficulties' with each (NLS Cullen, fols. 78-9). In his flnal course of lectures he stressed that none of these systems 'have the least effect or inffuence  in  explaining  anything.  They  do  not  either  admit  of  any application in Physic, or in any part of science that I see.' The adoption of one or the other only affects 'the business of religion'.^\n\nCullen had a very different attitude to the questions concerning the relation of mind and body raised by eighteenth-century physiologists, and  discussed  these  at  length  in  his  lectures.  They  concerned  the 'degree and extent' of  the mutual inffuence of soul and body, no matter what the soul may be. He noted that his predecessor Robert Whytt had 'with great strength of  argument shown that the Phenomena even of  the body itself, cannot be explained, but upon the supposition of a Soul as . . .   a sensible principle' (NLM, II, fols. 25-7). Whytt had maintained that all life functions require a soul or mind. In An essay on the vital and other  involuntary  motions  of animals he  had  formulated  the  issues  of physiological metaphysics of his day rather succinctly. He could not conceive the reason why Physicians have laboured so long in accounting for the action  of the heart  and  other  vital  motions  of animals,  from  the  powers  and properties of body independent of the mind:  if it be not, that in some, the leaven of  Cartesianism  still  continues  to  work;  in  others  a  too  great  fondness  for mechanical reasoning in Physiological matters; and in both, a contempt of the extravagant flights  of Stahl and  his  followers,  with  regard  to  the  manner  in which the mind regulates all the actions of the body.'*\n\nWhytt was opposed to the Cartesian principles that the vital functions take place independently of the mind, that the essence of the mind is to\n\n- ^   'The institutes of medicine by Dr Cullen Oct.  28,  1772'   (5  vols.):  National  Library of Medicine, Bethesda, Md., MS.

But he was  also opposed to the main alternative-^the so-called Stahlian theory, which maintained that the mind controls the body by acting as a 'rational' principle (Essay, p. 289). Both the Cartesian view and the Stahlian theory were espoused by Whytt's Scottish contemporaries.\n\nIn  this  paper  I  shall  explain  the  issues  concerning  the  mutual interaction of  mind and body which were debated by eighteenth-century Scottish physiologists.  Their debates must be understood against the background  of  a  dualism  between  mental  and  vital functions. This dualism, which we may caW   function dualism, had been clearly set out in Cartesian  writings  such  as  the Description  of the  human  body, where Descartes rejected the view that the soul or mind is responsible for life processes, and where he limited its functions to those accompanied by self-conscious  thought.^  Such  a  position  was  adopted  by  Hermann Boerhaave,  whose  thought  played  an  important  role  in  eighteenthcentury  Scottish  physiology.  The  essential  problems  posed  by  the writers we shall look at concern the extent to which the vital processes affect the mind, and the extent to which and manner whereby mental processes,  however  they  arise,  affect  those  vital  processes.  These problems,  though  independent,  are  closely  related  to  the  question whether the vital processes can be explained mechanically. But I shall argue that physiologists such as Whytt and Porterfield, who maintained that the life functions require mind or soul, went beyond a bare rejection of  mechanism.  They  conceived  of  mind  and  its  basic  functions  of sensation and volition in very different ways from those who subscribed to  the  basic  principles  of  Cartesian  metaphysics,  as  well  as  in  very different ways from one another.\n\nIt may be cause for surprise that major issues in what we should now call philosophy of mind were discussed by medical writers of whom few present-day philosophers have heard. However, I hope to show that our lack of acquaintance may not indicate any  lack of profundity  in their thought  or  in  the  problems  they  debated. Traditional  history  of philosophy in addressing the philosophy of mind has perhaps concen­ trated too narrowly on theological issues which arise from a substance dualism. This dualism was also given a seventeenth-century philosophi­ cal formulation by Descartes, in his conceptual distinction between two different natures,  a thinking and an extended one.  But it needs  to  be\n\n- ' The philosophical writings of Descartes (hereafter trans.  J.  G.  Cottingham  and others, vol.  i   (Cambridge  1985), pp. 314-15. Cf. Passions of the soul, arts. 4-5 {PWD, yol.  I, p. 329). On the Cartesian programme in physiology see T. S. Hall, History ofgeneral  physiology, vol.  I  (Chicago  1975), esp. pp. 256-7, and his translation of Rene Descartes, Treatise of man (Cambridge, Mass.  1972).\n\ncarefully distinguished from what I have called/wncrion dualism. Many who  adopted  substance  dualism  (Boerhaave  and  Haller  are  obvious examples)  hold  that  there  is  a  one-to-one  correspondence  between mental events and  brain events, however  it is to be  explained. Nevertheless, the central issues of mid-eighteenth-century philosophy of  mind lie elsewhere-in the problems raised by function dualism. Both a more accurate history, and (in so far as our present-day concepts have their roots in that history) a more fruitful philosophy, will result from taking such problems seriously.\n\nBy the  time  Cullen  was  giving  his  lectures  in  the  early  1770s,  the Edinburgh Medical School was among the most renowned in Europe. He himself had been a student in its early years in the mid to late 1730s. In his clinical lectures of 1785-86 he commented that during his studies he had 'learned the system of Boerhaave' and was taught to think that that medical system was 'very perfect, complete and sufficient'. When he had returned to Edinburgh some twenty years later he 'still found the system of Boerhaave prevailing as much as ever'.®  Cullen claimed to reject important parts of Boerhaave's system-for example, the view of the body as a hydraulic machine.' He stressed the centrality of  the central nervous system in the production of life processes,* and tended to think of it as  operating on principles analogous  to those of static electricity {Institutions, props. 125,130). However, in section V of  this paper I shall argue that Cullen adopted a Cartesian conception of mind which was closer  to  that  of  Boerhaave  than  to  that  of  his  own  immediate predecessors.  It  is  Cullen's  analyses  of 'sensation'  and  'volition' which provided his  solution to the problem of mind-body interaction posed by them.\n\nAlthough there are good grounds to question Cullen's retrospective claim about the monolithic teaching of physiology among his predeces­ sors, there is no doubt that Boerhaave's doctrines were very important in the Edinburgh curriculum until about 1760. For this reason I begin in the next section with a study of the  central principles  of Boerhaave's physiological  system. In  section  III,  I  examine  the  metaphysical physiology  of  William  Porterfield  and  its  seventeenth-century  antiCartesian origins. The fourth section is devoted to the ideas of Robert\n\n- '  John Thomson, An account of the life, lectures, and writings of William Cullen, M.D., vol.  I (Edinburgh 1859), pp.  118-19.\n\n^   NLM, II, fol.  I.  Cullen purported to adopt the  system of Friedrich Hoffmann, whose Pundamenta medicinae was  published in  1695.  But  Cullen exaggerated the extent  to which Boerhaave disregarded the nervous system. Indeed, Haller took issue with Boerhaave because he attributed too much influence to the nervous power (sect.  IV below).\n\n*   In commenting on proposition 97 of his Institutions in  1772, Cullen spoke of the animal power seated in the brain as 'the fundamental part of the System without which the Functions cannot long remain'. This power was either 'a Sentient principle or a Mechanical Energy' (NLM, II, fols.  195-6).\n\nWhytt,  the  undoubted  genius  of eighteenth-century  Scottish  physi­ ology, whose metaphysical ideas are rooted in a very different medical and philosophical tradition from that of  Boerhaave. In the final section I examine the synthesis of earlier ideas which was effected by Cullen.\n\n## I I .   BOERHAAVIAN  PHYSIOLOGY  AT  EDINBURGH\n\nWhile  there  had  been  earlier  attempts  to  found  a  medical  school  in Edinburgh,  it  has  been  traditional  to  date  its  beginning  from  the appointment  of  four  new  professors  in  1726.  Porterfield  had  been appointed to the first chair in the Institutes and Practice of Medicine in 1724;  but  while  he  continued  to  be  an  active  member  of the  Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, and the Edinburgh Society for the Improvement of Medical Knowledge, there is no evidence that he ever lectured  or  played  any  further  role  in  the  Medical  School.  Another earlier  appointment  was  that  of Alexander  Monro (primus) who,  as professor of  Anatomy, played a fundamental role in the foundation of  the faculty.®  All  of these  men,  including  Porterfield,  had matriculated  in medicine  at  the  University  of  Leiden  between  1718  and  1720,  and probably attended the  lectures  of Boerhaave  while  they were there.'® Boerhaave's  texts  were  certainly  assigned  in  Edinburgh  in  the  early 1740s. An advertisement for medical lectures in 1741 announced that Dr Andrew St Clair, professor of the Theory of Physic, would teach 'by explaining the Injtitutiones medicae composed by Dr Herman Boerhaave'.\"  St  Clair  had  been  one  of the  first  professors,  so  it  is possible that Cullen had attended earlier lectures by him, as well as those of the other teachers in the new School.\n\nThe topics which interest us are outlined in various propositions of Boerhaave's Institutiones  medicae. This  work underwent a number of editions, beginning in 1708. The numbered propositions often served as little  more  than  a  succinct  statement  of  the  doctrines  developed  in Boerhaave's actual lectures. A student's transcription of St Clair's Latin lectures on this work has been preserved and I  shall refer to this after examining Boerhaave's own doctrines. These were readily available to students after 1739 with Haller's publication of  Boerhaave's lectures.\" A somewhat free English translation appeared a few years later under the\n\n- '  A.

Hereafter, ' Praelectiones': I  shall refer to this by volume and page number.\n\ntitle Dr. Boerhaave's academical lectures on the theory of  physic,^^ in the following account I  shall generally quote from this, supplementing or replacing it where necessary.\n\nBoerhaave's commitment to mechanism in medicine was armounced in his Oratio de usu ratiocinii mechanici in medicinaf* delivered in Leiden in  1703,  in  the  third  year  after  his  appointment  to  a  lectureship  in medicine. He compared the human body to a clock which anyone can see to be faulty, but which can only be corrected by the expert who 'from his knowledge of the correct structure, discerns the defects of the parts and the  ways  and  means  of  repairing  them' (Orations, p.  i n ) .   To  the objection  that  'life,  diseases  and  health  derive  from  non-mechanical principles', since the mind has power over the body, Boerhaave replied that 'as soon as the capacity of  thinking influences our body, every effect it brings about therein is wholly corporeal, and so subject to mechanical laws'. Even if the prime cause were incorporeal, still the physician need only concern himself with corporeal conditions in medicine (p.  114).'^\n\nThe  clock  image  appeared  again  in  Boerhaave's  discussion  of the natural sources of  medical knowledge at the beginning of  the Academical lectures. He noted that the human body can act as an automaton, and gave a watch as the example of the latter. An automaton is a 'Machine that performs various Motions without any other Cause than the Mechanism of  its own Parts within itself^ which, when once put in Motion, continues so, from the same Cause'. The analogy is used to support a view of the animal body as a machine which can operate completely independently, without any cause but the necessary motion of  its own inner mechanism. The mainspring in the body is the heart, 'which continues its alternate Contractions  and  Dilations  so  long  as  the  Animal  lives' .  Boerhaave noted  that  such  motions  are  independent  of the  mind:  they  can  be neither produced nor destroyed 'by the influence of the Mind or Will' (Lectures, 4.1).\n\nThe examples of automatic motions which he went on to give indicate that  he  had  in  mind  a  far  more  complex  machine  than  a  clock.  In proposition 4 he was primarily concerned with the automatic responses of the body for preserving health and warding off disease.  He gave a number of examples of automatic defence mechanisms of the bodywhich he identified with the Hippocratic healing power of Nature.\n\n- Dr.  Boerhaave's academical lectures on the theory of physic, being . . .   a translation of his Institutes and  explanatory  comment, 5 vols.

Descartes' Description of the human body {PWD, vol.  i, p. 315).\n\nWhen Poison, has been taken, the Animal must inevitably perish, if its Force gets  into  the  Blood  .  .  .  ;  but  provident  Nature,  or  this  automatic  Motion generally does, what every,expert Physician ought first to  do, i.e.  ejects it by Vomit.\n\nAnother  example  used  to  stress  the  independence  of these  defensive motions from the mind is of particular interest. The mind is not able  to  suppress  these  automatic  Endeavours  of  our  Machines  for  Selfpreservation. Suppose one Friend tells another that he is only going to threaten him with a Blow upon the Eye, and therefore bids him endeavour not to shut it at the Offer: The Mind is at that Time secure from Danger; but the specious Offer is no sooner made than the Lids of that tender Organ are closed; notwithstand­ ing all the Reasons and Reluctancy of the Mind to the contrary. {Lectures, 4.1)\n\nThis example had been employed by Descartes in his Passions of the soul (sec.  13).  It  appears  that  for  both  thinkers  the  action  of the  mind  is identified with our  conscious  effort to keep  our eyes open; the action which occurs in spite of  our conscious effort is ascribed to the mechanism of the body. Boerhaave stressed that the automatic defence motions of the  body  are  made  without  any  consciousness  of the  mind {sine  ulla mentis conscientia fiunt: Praelectiones, I, p.  5).\n\nThe  purely  automatic  and  unconscious action  of  the  body  of proposition 4 of the Institutes is contrasted in proposition 5 with those actions which arise from an 'uneasy Sensation' (molesta  perceptio) in the mind. Boerhaave stressed that this  latter is  a principle  'quite distinct from  that  of the  automatic  Motions  of the  Body',  and  that  'these Endeavours' to remove a painful sensation 'belong to the Mind'. But he carefully distinguished these 'Endeavours of  the Mind for Ease' into two kinds-those which are quite spontaneous, and those which arise from reason and observation. In the first category he places actions such as the rubbing of  one's eye to get rid of  an itc h i^ o r the attempt to relieve  &gt; a  muscular pain  by trying  out  different  positions  of one's  body.  The second involves a rational observation which determines which of these spontaneous  remedies  really  work.  This  is  regarded  as  an  important source of the art of medicine {Lectures, 5.1).\n\nThe Cartesian doctrine of soul or mind as essentially conscious-like that  of  the  automatism  in  a  living  body-is  central  to  Boerhaave's Academical lectures. In proposition 27 of his Institutes he asserted that 'Man is composed of a Body and Mind, united to each other'. He also noted  that  mind  and  body  have  distinct  natures.  In  his  lecture  he explained that 'the essential Nature of the Mind is to be conscious, or to think'.'®   For Boerhaave, no less than Descartes, this disjunction does\n\n'Mentis est, esse conscium sive cogitare' {Praelectiones, I, p. 41). Boerhaave was awarded a doctorate in philosophy for a thesis De distinctione mentis a corpore (Leiden 1690). He argued\n\nnot indicate a mere tautology. Thought is inherently reflexive: we are not merely aware, but are aware of ourselves as being aware.\n\nBoerhaave wrote that volition (voluntas) 'is the action of the mind' (Lectures 27.6;  cf.  Descartes, Passions, secs.  13,  17).  We  have  already seen  that  conscious effort  played  a  fundamental  role  for  him  in distinguishing the action of the mind from the automatic motions of the body  machine. He  included  volition, along  with  perception  and judgement, as one of  the three functions of  the mind which constitute its 'life',  and  noted  that  the  life  of  the  mind  is  nothing  but  'to  be conscious'. Later, he describes a voluntary movement (motus voluntarius) as one which results from a definition or determination of the mind (a  mente  definiente). He  illustrates  this  by  a  situation  where  he  has decided to move a limb when the hands of  a clock reach a certain position ten minutes hence^ this is  'certainly a Foresight of something not yet existing: The inclination comes to me (accedit voluntas), I will (volo), and I define the time' . Voluntary action, at least in this case, clearly arises from a conscious effort of  the will (Lectures, 695.13 ^ Praelectiones, VI, pp.  1,6-7). But while everyone is acquainted with volition, it is what 'no one can explain' (Lectures, 27.6).\n\nWhile  Boerhaave  conceived  of  the  conscious  will  as  a  source  of motions in the human body, he also thought that the will itself arises from mechanical actions in that body, in particular those arising from changes  in  the  nervous  system.  He  describes  the  way  that  external objects, after causing motions in the nerves, transfer those motions to the common sensory in the brain. There they form an idea of the object:\n\ngenerally this Idea or Representation of the Object excites something more than the  bare  Representation,  which  is  not  a  simple  Idea  or  Perception,  but  a Determination of the Will with respect to the Idea. (Lectures, 572.1)\n\nIt is in the 'sensorium' in the brain where all the nerves terminate that the impressions of external objects 'determine the will either to love or hatred' (574.2). Even when we recall a certain idea in obedience to the will, this results from 'nothing more than a mechanical Disposition or Change' in the common sensory (581; cf. 580 for the context). The only that the mind 'excludes the body' on the ground that mind is 'conscious to itself of its own thought' and that as such it turns back on itself  without being divided; this is impossible in an extended thing (chap. 3). He appealed here to the authority of  Gerard de Vries, who had argued against Dutch Cartesians that belief in innate ideas is irreconcilable with the principle that all thought must be conscious (G.  Lewis, Le Probleme de I'inconscient et le Cartesianisme (Paris 1950)) PP-  140-41,170)- Boerhaave was closely connected with the Cartesian de Voider (G. A. Lindeboom, Hermann Boerhaave, the man and his work (London 1968), p. 24), who held that the mind apprehends itself  directly in being conscious (Lewis, pp.  117-18). On Descartes'  own view see R. McRae, 'Descartes' definition of thought', in Cartesian studies, ed.  R.  J.  Butler (Oxford 1972), 55-70; Lewis, pp. 37-103.\n\nhint of an exception to the complete mechanical determination of our perceptions, judgements, and volitions came when Boerhaave suggested that the thinking of  a person engrossed in abstract thought, who becomes totally impervious to the state of his body, gives us some evidence that the mind 'may live hereafter without any Commerce with its Body' (27.4).  But  in  general,  as  Cullen  later  told  his  students,  the  stress throughout Boerhaave's  discussion was  on the  dependence of mental processes, including volition, upon the mechanical changes in the body. Boerhaave  insisted  that  there  is  'such  a  reciprocal  Connection  and Consent between the particular Thoughts and Affections of the Mind and the Body, that a Change in one always produces a Change in the other, and the reverse' (27(4)). In fact, at least from the point of view of medicine, he thought that mechanical changes in the nervous system had priority over changes in the mind. He insisted that the physician did not need to concern himself  with the condition of  mind of  his patient, even in mental  disorders,  since  if the  body  'is  set  to  rights'  the  mind  'will quickly return to its Office' (27.8).\n\nGiven his apparent mechanical determinism, we may well ask about the significance of dualism in Boerhaave's lectures, for, as we have seen, he asserted unequivocally that mind and body are of  different natures. In fact, he stressed the difference between sensations on the one hand, and the  mechanical  changes  in  the  brain  and  the  object  which  cause  the sensation on the other:\n\nThe  Idea of Pain which we  perceive,  neither  expresses  the  Burning  nor  the Dissolution of  the N  erve; for there is only one Intelligence given to the Mind of  a present Evil, agreeable to the good Will of the Creator.  Sensation therefore is nothing either in the Object, or the Nerve affected; but a certain Idea which God had determined or assigned to each particular Change in the corporeal Sensory. (5 7 0 -7 )\n\nIt is  the fact that these processes are of such a different nature which requires that they be connected by a law established by the Deity. Like Cullen later, Boerhaave briefly outlined the three philosophical theories of the connection of mind and body; but unlike Cullen he opted for one of them, namely the Leibnizian.  It is likely, he told his  students, that there is 'a Harmony establish'd by God, taking it for an infallible Rule, that determinate actions of the Mind must be necessarily attended with corresponding Motions in the Body, and the contrary'.  But he added that the occasionalist theory was also possible.\n\nHowever, there is a more important dualism implicit in Boerhaave's lectures which is quite different from his distinction between immediate objects  of awareness  and the related mechanical changes in the body. This is a dualism between those (brain) processes on which our mental\n\n2 6 o functions depend and those processes on which life itself  depends. At the beginning  of his  section  on  pathology  Boerhaave  made  a  distinction between  'animal'  or mind-related  functions  of the  body  on  the  one hand, and 'vital' and 'natural' ones on the other. An animal function is defined  as  one  which has  the power of directly  changing thoughts  or ideas in the mind or being directly changed by the mind. A vital function is one on which life immediately depends: the beating of the heart is the standard example. The natural functions, like digestion and excretion, are required to maintain the body in a continuous state of health. The animal functions have no direct effect on the vital and natural ones, nor do these directly affect the animal ones:\n\nThe vital Actions do not change the Thoughts or Ideas of the Mind; nor, on the other Hand, are those Actions dependent on, or determined by, the Mind: For the Heart continues to act, whether I am sleeping or waking. Nor are the Ideas of the  Mind  changed  from  the  Exercise  of the  natural  Faculties  by  which  the Aliments are formed into Chyle.  .  .  . (695.11)\n\nThus we have no sensation of the operation of the muscles involved in our vital and digestive processes,and these neither directly affect, nor can be affected by, the thoughts of the mind.\n\nThis dualism of functions depends on the independence of the organs on  which  the  functions  depend.  In  his  discussion  of the  'Action  of Muscles' he noted that when the brain is damaged 'in such a Manner as to  let  the  Injury  extend  to  the  Medulla'  then  'the  actions  of all  the voluntary  Muscles  cease  instantly,  together  with  all  the  Senses  and Memory'. In spite of this, the 'spontaneous Motions of  the involuntary Muscles'  continue  in  all  the  'vital  Parts'.  However,  these  too  are destroyed along with the animal functions, when the cerebellum alone is destroyed. Boerhaave stressed that the nerves to the heart arise only from the  cerebellum,  not  from  the higher  brain  (401(2-3),  401.7).  He  also distinguished  the  voluntary muscles  from  the  involuntary  ones,  even those  involved  in  respiration.'*  Indeed,  in  his  discussion  of  sleep, Boerhaave went so far as to speak of two distinct machines in the bodies of men and animals. One of these 'is dead' through much of our lives (that is, whenever we are in a dreamless sleep), while the other continues to function throughout. He stressed the independent operation of these machines, though he also clearly acknowledged the dependence of the former on the latter (590.1).\n\nBoerhaave  did  hold {Lectures, 301.6)  that  when  the  heart  and  other  visceral  muscles become inflamed we feel pain.  However, he denied that distinct muscles of the heart were sensible.\n\nBoerhaave distinguished the vital from the voluntary causes of  respiration and maintained that the former can override the latter.  Two  distinct sets of muscles are controlled by two different parts of the brain (Lectures, 6oiff.).\n\nBoerhaave's  separation  of  animal  and  vital  functions  is closely connected with his rejection of the notion of a life soul. In his discussion of pathology he  identified the  soul or psyche as  that part  of us  which thinks (Praelectiones, VI, p. 5)- He opposed those who have taken into account an 'animating Principle' in medicine. In particular, there is no evidence for the existence of an 'Archeus' or  'cogitative Principle' . Thus he sets himself clearly against the  immaterial physiological and pathological principles of two earlier medical writers, Jean-Baptiste van Helmont and Georg Stahl {Lectures, 697, 697.2).\n\nBut at least one phenomenon lay, as it were, in the gap between the two functions which Boerhaave tried to hold separate. We have seen that, for Boerhaave, an essential feature of  animal functions is that they take place with consciousness. This was clearly true of  voluntary actions, which he located in the brain itself and in certain muscles.  But in his Institutes, when dealing with muscular action, Boerhaave had written that 'while the Will remains undetermined' there is no movement of nervous fluid toward the voluntary muscles,  and thus they remain at rest {Lectures, 40(14); Praelectiones, III, p.  202). He noted that in sleep 'none of the voluntary muscles will . . .  be brought into action' {Lectures, 401.23). However,  he  also  felt  compelled  to  note  an  anomalous  phenomenon which does not easily fit his account. Some actions which originally had their  source  in  the  will  come  to  be  performed  by  custom  without consciousness. We often walk without thinking about what we are doing; and after we wake up in the morning, we sit up and in doing so place our limbs in that position 'to which they have been accustomed through the whole Course of Life, without giving them any sensible Command of the Will'. The English translation has Boerhaave claiming that in such cases we operate  'from  Custom by  the  Influence  of the  Mind, of which  by continued Use we are insensible' (401.24, italics mine); but Boerhaave himself  did not say that the mind acts insensibly.The translation clearly conflicts  with  what  he  says  elsewhere.  Nevertheless,  Boerhaave  does seem to  have  a  problem,  given  his  insistence  that  voluntary  muscles operate only under the influence of the will. If the mind must operate in order to effect the motion of voluntary muscles, why not say that in the problematic  cases  it  acts  unconsciously?  This  is  what  certain  of Boerhaave's Scottish critics were quite prepared to say.\n\nI  have  called  Boerhaave's  distinction  between  mental  and  vital functions 'Cartesian' . He rejects any vital soul and identifies soul with that  part  of us  which is  conscious.  This  is  clearly  in accord  with  the conceptual revolution which Descartes proposed at the beginning of his\n\notnnino in corpore musculi voluntarii,  gui ex sola consuetudine, injussi &amp; nobis non consciis  operantur\", i.e.  the  voluntary  muscles  'operate  solely  from  habit,  unbidden,  and without our consciousness of it' {Praelectiones, III, p. 218).\n\nDescription  of the  human  body and  elsewhere.  Boerhaave  went  on,  in accord with the physiological programme which Descartes laid out, to describe bodily processes such as the motion of the heart, as resulting from the mechanism of the parts and as being entirely automatic. Yet it would be wrong simply to call Boerhaave a Cartesian, for his conception of  the  mind  and  body  differ  in  certain  key  respects  from  that  of Descartes. The difference between their theories of mind is not relevant to  our  present  concerns,^®  but  it  is  important  for  our  subsequent discussion  to  consider  briefly  Boerhaave's  general  conception  of the body and how it differs from the Cartesian one.\n\nLike Descartes, Boerhaave held that the basic principles operating in the  human  body  were  the  same  as  those  operative  throughout  the universe.  But  Descartes  had  held  that  body  could  be  completely characterized  by  the  attribute  of extension,  and  its  processes  by  the mechanical  transfer  of motion  from  part  to  part.  In  his  lecture  on Institutes prop.  27,  Boerhaave  adopted the  conception of body-then accepted by Locke and Newton, as well as Leibniz-as that which is impenetrable, as  well  as extended. Moreover,  while  he  held  that  the 'action' of a body consists in the transfer of  motion to another body, he also  spoke of all bodies as having a 'life'. Among those things which constitute the life of bodies he included the force of attraction between the constituent parts. It is commonly said that Boerhaave thought of  the body merely as a hydraulic machine; but it is more accurate to say he conceived of the body machine as involving an interaction between the solid elastic vessels and the fluids which were forced through them. The force  of elasticity  played  an  important  role  in  his  conception  of the generation of  motion in the living body. Boerhaave described the body as 'an Assemblage of small elastic Solids, by whose conjoined and regular Actions, Life and Health are produced'.  Later he identified elasticity with a 'Resistance or Re-action common to all Bodies' (695.2).  This force of  elasticity is a 'universal Principle of  Nature', and like the power of gravitation by which planets are attracted towards each other it is not innate in matter itself.  It is  'to be ascribed only to the Creator of the Universe, who has determined this as a Principle uniting the Parts of Bodies'. Boerhaave was clearly drawing on a set of concepts which were richer than those allowed by Cartesian physics.\n\nBoerhaave  defined  'mechanics'  very  broadly  as  the  study  which teaches one 'to apply the general Laws of  Motion to all kinds of  Bodies' (29.3). The fact that he was willing to allow principles such as elasticity and attraction did not for him constitute any limitation to mechanism.\n\n'   Against Descartes, Boerhaave held that there is no more to mind itself than the thought of the present moment {Lectures, 581.1); he also rejected Descartes'   view that judgement is a function of will (586.14).\n\nHowever, other writers more firmly planted in the Newtonian tradition were concerned to show that the existence of such 'active' principles did indicate the limits of mechanism in nature itself.\"\"\n\nBy Boerhaave's time most writers on the animal economy expressed reservations  about the universal application of mechanical principles. However, it is important to consider carefully the exact nature of the limitations which any given author imposed. Boerhaave commented that 'they  who  think  that  all  physical  Appearances  are  to  be  explained mechanically,  are  in  my  Opinion  misled'  (ip.?)-  When  examined  in context, this will be seen to be a comment on the limits of  our knowledge, not a remark to indicate that other principles operate in things besides mechanical  ones.  In his  lecture on proposition 40  Boerhaave told his students that 'there are many, and considerable Motions performed in Nature, of whose Causes we are ignorant; but the Motions themselves are  always  subject  to  those  universal  Laws  which  appear  true  in  all sensible  Bodies'  (40.20).  He  was  particularly  critical  of attempts  to apply geometrical principles taken from 'Bodies of particular Disposi­ tions' to the explanation of complex organic processes (19.7)-\n\nIt  is,  however,  misleading  to  take  Boerhaave's declarations of epistemological  scepticism  too  seriously.  He  did  not  hesitate  to  put forward mechanical hypotheses to support his own mechanical view of the operations of  the human body. Throughout his lectures he described how the elastic solids which constitute the 'vessels' of the body react to the 'dilatation' or expansion caused by the fiuids which flow into them. This interaction was employed in his explanation of the operation of the heart.  Boerhaave  thought  that  all  muscular  motion  results  from  the motion of a 'nervous liquor' or 'spirit' which flows from the brain via the nerves, so that it 'dilates, fills and alters the Membranes of  the Fibres [of the muscles], as to reduce them from an oblong to a rounder Figure, increasing their smaller Diameter, and diminishing their larger, so as to bring Tendons nearer to each other' (402(7)). Boerhaave thought that there is a constant pressure of  nervous fluid in all the muscles of  the body keeping  them in  a  constant  state  of contraction.  However,  when  the muscle of the heart contracts, the flow of blood into the auricles makes them expand and cut off  the flow of  fluid from the cardiac nerves 'which pass into the Heart by the  Side of the Aorta and pulmonary Artery'. This makes the muscles of the ventricles 'paralytic', allowing them to relax and fill up with blood from the auricles. This releases the pressure on the cardiac nerves and allows nervous fluid to flow into the muscles of the ventricles again, causing them to contract and start the process again. The whole system operates in a purely automatic way, depending only\n\n- J.  P.  Wright,  'Matter,  mind  and  active  principles  in  mid  eighteenth-century  British physiology', Man and nature 4 (Edmonton 1985)3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n264\n\non  a  continuous  pressure  of nervous  fluid  through  the  nerves  and  a constant supply of blood from the vena cava and pulmonary veins (409). We shall see that Robert Whytt presented convincing arguments to show that this mechanism of the operation of the heart muscles will not work.\n\nIt  is  difficult  to  draw  firm  conclusions  about the  teaching  of these doctrines in Edinburgh. It would, of course, be wrong to conclude that just  because  Boerhaave's Institutes was  used  as  a  text  his  views  were always taught uncritically. Nevertheless there is some reason to think, both from the statements of Cullen and from the rough set of student notes surviving from St Clair's lectures in 1740,^^ that some version of these  doctrines  was  presented  in  the  1730s  and  early  1740s.  Like Boerhaave,  St  Clair held that the only  explanatory principles  for lifephenomena are mechanical ones; however, he showed, if anything, more scepticism about our ability to fathom what these are. Part of  the note on proposition 4 reads:\n\nThe greatest mistake is of those who wish nothing to be considered in medicine except what can be explained mechanically. Nothing indeed should be explained except  mechanically,  but  many  things  may  be  considered  for  which  no mechanical explanation can be given and for which we can give no a priori cause. (St Clair, I, pp.  15-16)\n\nThis scepticism appears to continue in the lecture on proposition 27, where, instead of giving the essence of body and mind as Boerhaave had done,  the  view  is  expressed  that  'the  cleverest .philosopher  does not know the intimate nature of  anything' (p. 79). Nevertheless, though in a rather  confused  way,  Boerhaave's  central- teaching  on  these  topics emerges in the course of the lecture.\n\nWhat  appears  to  be  a  more  substantial  difference  occurs  at  the beginning of the lecture on proposition 27. At first sight St Clair appears totally  opposed to  Boerhaave's  own  central  doctrine  on  the  indepen­ dence of cognitive and vital functions. The manuscript reads: 'Mind is part of  man himself. If  the soul is destroyed, this makes the body lifeless and rigid' (p. 79). It would seem that life processes are being ascribed to some sort of vital soul!  However, what follows is a Boerhaavian account which clearly separates the mind from any vital functions:\n\nLet me first overturn the objections of those who argue that the human body without the prop of  mind is lifeless and useless..  .  . Let such a philosopher order if he can his own heart to move slower or faster.  Can he determine the blood through his own body by the power of  mind.  .  .  ?  From these and many others it is  clear that most activities obey the power of mind not at all.  (p. 80)\n\n## Like Boerhaave, St Clair claimed that 'to think is to be conscious' and\n\n'Praelectiones in Institutiones Boerhavii a Andreo St. Claire M.D.', 3 vols. (1740): RCPE, MS. M9.35-7.\n\n266\n\nPorterfield's comments on the operations of the mind in the body first appeared towards the end of  the initial part of  the article, in the course of his discussion of the cause of the fact that our two eyes-unlike those of chameleons and other animals-operate together ('Motions of our eyes', I,  pp.  i63ff.).  He  began  with  an  account  of what he  called  'the final Cause of this uniform Motion', or, in other words, the ways in which it is advantageous to us. The first advantage is that it results in a stronger, more lively, and perfect image of the object (p.  184). He also argued that uniform motion is not necessary  to  see  a  single  object with  two  eyes (pp.  192-252).^^ He rejected Berkeley's theory of vision (which relies on an experienced correlation of sight with touch), arguing that we have a kind of immediate knowledge of externality through sight (pp. 229ff.). Nevertheless, his own account of vision is not purely innatist and, like that of Berkeley, takes account of the role of experience.\n\nThe most important advantage of the imiform motion of our eyes, according to Porterfield, is in enabling us 'to judge with more Certainty of the Distance of Objects'  (p.  187).  The most common and reliable method of judging distance is by our knowledge of  the angle made by the axis of each of our eyes when they focus together on an object in front of us: the smaller the angle made at the convergence of the lines from each eye at the object, the more distant the object. The judgement is made on the basis of  our feeling or sensation of  the motion of  each eye as it focuses inward on the object (p.  189). His account here closely follows that of Malebranche.^® Like Malebranche, he held that this sensation incorpor­ ates a kind of  natural judgement of  distance.^® This depends on an innate principle that 'Every Point of an Object appears and is seen without the Eye nearly in a straight Line, drawn perpendicularly to the Retina, from that Point of  it where its Image falls' (p. 208). Porterfield seems to think that it is by employing this principle that we are naturally able to judge the,distance of  objects by the uniform motions of  our eyes. Malebranche had  called  such  judgements  'natural'  because  they  are  formed  'in ourselves, independently of ourselves, and even in spite of ourselves' .^ ® He ascribed such judgements to God, who makes them just as we would do if we knew all the laws of optics and geometry as well as everything\n\n- He argued that this is effected in cross-eyed people in spite of  the fact that their two eyes do not focus together. Porterfield correctly opposes Claude Perrault on this.\n- Nicolas Malebranche, The search  after  truth, trans.  T.  M.  Lennon and P.  J.  Olscarap (Columbus 1980), pp. 737-8.\n- 'The Judgment we form of the Situation and Distance of visual Objects, depends not on Custom and Experience, but on an original connate and immutable Law, to which our Minds have been subjected from the Time they were first united to our Bodies.' (p. 214)\n- Malebranche, De la Recherche de la verite, ed.  G.  Rodis-Lewis, in Oeuvres completes de Malebranche, vol. i (Paris 1958),  p.  119;  cf.  p. 99.  My  translation.  For  an  account  of Malebranche's  theory  of  vision  see  j'.  P.  Wright, The  sceptical  realism  of  David  Hume (Manchester 1983), pp. 66-7, 225.\n\nthat was  happening  in  our  eyes  and  brains.  Porterfield,  on  the  other hand,  does  not  claim  that the natural  judgement  takes  place  entirely independently of our will. What I have called his innate principle is not in itself  sufficient to allow us to judge the distance of  objects. Indeed our judgement of distance by means of the innate principle depends on a voluntary and rational decision to use our eyes together.\n\nThis becomes clear when Porterfield turns to 'the efficient Cause' of the uniform motion of our eyes at the end of the first part of the essay (PP- 253ff.).  'By what Necessity', he asks, does it happen that  'both Eyes  are  always  turned  the  same  way,  so  that none of us  are  able  at pleasure  to  give  them  different  Directions?'  He  rejects  the  ancient theory which attempted to account for this by the union of the two optic nerves,  pointing  out  that  these  nerves  have  no  connection  with  the muscles of  the eye which are responsible for this motion. The true cause turns out to be nothing but 'Custom and Habit', which operate imder the  direction  of the  mind.  Whatever  necessity  there  is  in  the  action results  from  the  mind  itself.  For  'it  is  not  to  be  doubted  but  these Motions are voluntary, and depending upon our Mind, which being a wise Agent, wills them to move uniformly' (p. 255).\n\nThere are really two closely related features of this action which lead Porterfield to ascribe it to the mind-that it is learned and that it is useful to us. Like chameleons, human infants 'for some Time after Birth, can look different Ways with their Eyes'. Moreover, they continue to do so until 'discovering the Advantage of directing them the same way, they come to move them always uniformly' (p. 259). Here experience plays a role:  infants  make  a voluntary  decision to  employ their eyes  together after discovering that this results in the ability to determine the distance of objects.  In this  also,  we  see  the  importance  of Porterfield's  earlier discussion of  the 'final cause' of  the uniform motion of  our two eyes, he clearly regarded the action of moving both together as  an intentional action adopted for its utility. The infant acts both freely and with some kind of  foresight, based on the experienced result of  employing both eyes together.\n\nIt is due to the repetition of this action that, after a time, most human beings and other animals cannot move their eyes independently: 'This uniform Motion by Use and Habit at last becomes so necessary, that the Eyes cannot be moved differently' (p. 259). That there is no 'intrinsical Necessity' in this is clear from cross-eyed children who move their eyes separately. The necessity experienced by most of us arises from the fact that  'the Mind has  imposed upon  itself that  Law founded  upon the Utility and Advantage that arises from this sort of  Motion' (pp. 255-6). Later, in A treatise on the eye, Porterfield will refer to this as a 'moral necessity' {Treatise, vol.  2, p.  154).\n\n268\n\nIn  the  second  part  of the  original  essay  Porterfield  extended  this analysis to motions of the body which most would consider to be quite involuntary.  Indeed  he  includes  among  them  one  which,  as  we have seen, Boerhaave and Descartes considered to be directly contrary to the action of the mind.\n\nIf a Body be hastily moved towards our Eyes, they will shut without our being conscious thereof; neither is it in our Power to do otherwise, because we have accustomed ourselves to do so on the like Occasions; for such is the Power of Custom  and  Habit,  that  many  Actions  which  are  no  doubt  voluntary,  and proceed from our Mind, are in certain Circumstances rendered so necessary, as to appear altogether mechanical and independent on our Wills. ('Motions of  our eyes',  II, pp. 213-14)\n\nUnlike Boerhaave, Porterfield did not think that this action actually is mechanical and independent of our wills. He asserts that it is voluntary and directed by the mind. Indeed, Porterfield did not identify voluntary with conscious action. For he acknowledges that we are not conscious of the  motions  of  our  eyelids. It  is  clear  that  we  do  not  have  any consciousness even of an effort of the mind in producing those motions: indeed, what I  am conscious of is the contrary effort to keep my eyes open. But Porterfield did not think that my current consciousness of an inability to keep my eyes open shows that the action is not performed by my mind. He thinks that the true action of my mind is the one which results in the closing of  my eyelids. This arises from a law which I impose on myself through custom and habit.\n\nThe most obvious objection to Porterfield's claim that the closing of the eyelids  is  volimtary is  that we  cannot  do  otherwise.  However, he thinks that there is an important sense in which this is just false. There are people 'who can keep them open, though the Organs subservient to their Motions are the same as in other Men' . He appeals to the case cited in Plempius of Roman gladiators, who, through 'uncommon Fortitude and Courage, had not accustomed themselves on every trifling Occasion to shut their Eye-lids for the Defence of their Eyes' (p. 215). This and other examples show that the shutting of the lids is preventable even for the  rest  of us.  In  his Treatise Porterfield  held  that  in  'philosophical Strictness of Speech' a 'moral  Impossibility'  such as that which we find in the case of the closing of our eyelids 'is indeed no Necessity or Impossibility at all' . Custom still 'leaves the Mind at absolute Liberty to do as it pleases' . One might as well deny the freedom of  an honest man who, having formed a 'fixt and determined Resolution of acting always agreeably to what he sees to be fit and right', finds it impossible to 'do a dishonest  Thing'.  The  impossibility  is  merely  that  'it  is  absurd, mischievous and morally impossible for it to chuse to act .  .  . foolishly\n\nand unreasonably' {Treatise, vol. 2, pp.  I 54 ' 5 )- Like Boerhaave and the Cartesians, Porterfield thought the shutting of  our eyelids contributes to our self-preservation, but he rejected the view of these thinkers that it is automatic-performed by the body without the mind ('Motions of our eyes', II, p. 215). The goal of self-preservation is that of the individual mind itself which freely adopts this way of acting.\n\nIt  is  surprising  to  discover  Porterfield  does  not  even  consider  the possibility  that  what  is  performed  through  custom  and  habit  is performed mechanically. Descartes, Malebranche, and even Locke, had presented mechanical hypotheses-based on the creation of pathways in the brain-to account for the formation of mental and physical habits. While Boerhaave was troubled by the fact that voluntary muscles can move habitually  without  the  action  of the  will,  he  accounted  for  the associations  of  ideas  on  which  such  habits  depend  by  postulating mechanical connections in the common sensory {Lectures, 580.1). Thus he had the basis for the mechanical account of habit developed by his predecessors.\n\nThe chief function of custom and habit in Porterfield's explanation of actions such as the uniform motions of our eyes pnd the shutting of our eyelids was, it seems, that of making them unconscious, and so giving them the appearance of necessity. He wrote that 'the Mind, which at first  always  acted  from  a Principle  of Interest,  comes  at  length  to  be determined  by  Habit  and  Custom,  without  examining  how  far  such motions  may  be  profitable  or  hurtful  to  us,  or  at  least without  being sensible of any  such Examination;  and this  is  the  only  Reason  can  be given,  why  none  of us  are  now  able  to  move  our  Eyes  differently (pp. 214-15, italics mine). This suggests that even after such actions are performed insensibly they may  still  involve a rational  examination of what is the best motion. Perhaps Porterfield thought that when a hand is thrust in my eyes I make a very quick inference that closing them is the most useful  action!  In  any  case,  he  seems  to  have  recognized  that  in allowing  that  the  mind  could  act  insensibly  he  was  stepping  into philosophically dangerous waters. He knew that 'it has been alledged by Locke and others, that all the Thoughts  and  Operations  of the Mind, must necessarily be attended with Consciousness', and that this would be thought to tell against his claim that the actions he was describing were performed by the mind. In the article Porterfield did not want to get involved in the 'metaphysical Question' of the extent that 'Thoughts and  Operations  of the  Mind,  may  or  may  not  imply  Consciousness' (p. 216); though in his later book, he rejected Locke's appeal to direct experience to show that there are times in sleep when the mind is neither 'sensible nor active' . Porterfield claimed that, while direct experience could  not  decide  the  question,  there  were  arguments  to  show  that\n\nanimals  'are always both percipient and active' when asleep.^'  In the essay he limited himself  to the claim that 'there  are  Motions unquestionably  voluntary  and  depending  on  the  Mind,  which  by Custom and Habit have become so easy as to be performed without our Knowledge or Attention'  (II,  p. 217).  While  he  drew back  from his earlier  statement that  such actions  are performed  'without our being conscious  thereof'  (p. 213),  it  is  difficult  not  to  conclude  that  he  is saying the same in different words.^^\n\nThese  views  about  the  unconscious  operation  of  the  mind  are important when, in the second part of  the essay, Porterfield spelled out an earlier suggestion that the mind itself is the efficient cause of the vital and natural operations of  the body. He argued that, if  the mind can think and be 'very little conscious' of it as the Cartesians claimed, 'I see not why  it  may  not  also  be  allowed  to  exert  its  active  Power  in  the Government of the vital and natural Motions, without our Knowledge and Attention'. When children first learn to walk, 'the whole Mind is employed in conducting the Motions necessary for their Progression', so that if  they cease to attend to the activity, they will soon fall down. But when these motions come to be performed easily through custom and habit, 'they need but little Attention, and allow the Mind to employ its most serious and anxious Thoughts about other Matters' (pp. 226-7). By parity of reasoning, when a baby is born, its soul is totally involved 'in  regulating  and  governing  the  internal  Motions,  which  are  yet difficult, by reason it has not yet been much accustomed to them'. But when the soul or mind becomes accustomed to performing vital actions such as the beating of  the heart, and natural actions such as the digestion of  food, it is progressively able to attend to 'external Objects'. Thus the baby comes to appear 'less and less sleepy and unactive' . But what is really happening is that the mind, while it continues to perform them, is able to direct its attention away from the vital and natural operations of its own body (pp. 225-6). Thus Porterfield is suggesting that, just as in the case of the habitual actions which were discussed earlier, these latter continue  to  be  produced  voluntarily  but  without  any  self-conscious awareness.\n\nWhat Porterfield has noted  is  a  common process  by which actions which are self-consciously  chosen come to  be performed without our conscious control. Such actions, for example of the muscles in walking.\n\nTreatise on the eye, vol. 2, pp.  156-9. Porterfield argues that it is especially clear that birds, which have to grip branches in the wind, perceive and put forth some active power. While Borelli, in De motu animalium, had argued convincingly that the 'mechanical Disposition of  the Muscles' is used to help them 'grasp the Branch more forcibly', it is clear, thinks Porterfield, that these muscles alone are not sufficient to account for the phenomena.\n\nPorterfield confuses the issue in his book by claiming that the mind is conscious while asleep. Robert Whytt had no such hesitancy in admitting that the mind acts unconsciously.\n\ncome through custom and habit to be performed without knowledge and attention.  His  suggestion  about  the  control  of the  vital  and  natural operations  of the  body .is  based  on  an  extrapolation  of the  common process to explain a, phenomenon to which we do-not ordinarily think it applies.  The  legitimacy  of this  extrapolation  was  challenged  by  later Scottish thinkers.\n\nIn support of his hypothesis that the vital operations of the body are voluntary, Porterfield also cited evidence which had been presented a few years earlier in George Cheyne's popular study, The English malady. Cheyne  had  described  the  case  of  a  Colonel  Townshend  who  had summoned  him  a  few  days  before  death  to  show  that  he  'could  at pleasure suppress all the vital Motions, so as in all Respects to appear dead, and yet by an Effort, or some how, he could come to Life again, and restore these Motions' ('Motions of our eyes', II, p. 222). Cheyne had reported that he and two other physicians, while doubtful that any such thing was possible 'as it was not to be accounted for from now common Principles', agreed to wimess the experiment. After a half  hour or so the man's pulse was no longer detectable and they assumed he had carried the experiment too far. However, the pulse did finally become detectable again and the man did regain full consciousness.  Cheyne 'went away fully satisfy'd as to all the Particulars of this Fact, but confounded and puzled, and not able to form any rational Scheme that might account for it' . 3 3 In reporting the case, Porterfield wrote Aat it is 'not at all to be accoimted  for,  without  allowing  the  Mind  to  preside  over  the  vital Motions' (p. 222). He appears to have considered this case parallel to that of the  gladiators  who  can prevent  themselves  from  closing  their eyelids when a hand is thrust'in their faces. The unusual case supports the hypothesis that even ordinary heart motion is voluntary.\n\nPorterfield and  Cheyne seem to have believed that the Townshend case provided a kind of crucial experiment which challenged the claim of Boerhaave and his followers that the mind cannot affect the vital and natural motions of the body. However, as we have seen from St Clair's lectures,  the  whole  medical  establishment  was  not  immediately  won over. St Clair challenged physicians like Porterfield and Cheyne to show that they could voluntarily control the beating of their own hearts. They seem never to have taken up the challenge!\n\nOur authors also appealed to the evidence that the vital motions of  the body  are  influenced  by  the  passions  of  fear,  grief,  joy,  rage,  etc. ('Motions of  our eyes', II, p. 222; English malady, p. 68). Boerhaave had\n\n- George Cheyne, The English malady (London 1733), pp. 307-11. Cheyne was a Scot from Aberdeenshire who had studied medicine in Edinburgh with Archibald Pitcairne, one of the leading figures of European iatro-mechanism. Cheyne went to London in 1702, where, as well as setting up a medical practice, he became a member of the Royal Society.\n\nconsidered love and hatred to arise in a kind of automatic way from the effect  of objects  on  us.  In  his  pathology  he  explicitly  identified  the passions  with  mechanical  changes  in  the  common  sensory {Lectures, 744.4). This was in accord with the general conception of die passions espoused by Descartes, who regarded the mental aspect of the passion, that is the feeling, as a kind of epiphenomenon.^^ But writers at this time challenged this  account and argued that the influence of the passions indicated the effect of the mind on the body.^^\n\nPorterfield  and  Cheyne  regarded  themselves  as  breaking  with  the dominant physiological tradition when they presented their accounts of both the nature and extent of the mind's control over the body. At the same time,  both writers  accepted  current mechanical  accoxmts  of the bodily processes themselves. Porterfield wrote that 'we all know there is nothing in the animal Machine but an Infinity of branching and winding Canals,  filled  with  Liquors  of  different  Natures,  going  the  same perpetual Round' ('Motions of our eyes', II, p. 219). He was repeating the  image  set  out  in  the  introduction  of  Cheyne's English  malady. Cheyne told his readers that to understand what he had to  say about nervous diseases, they need only suppose, that the Human Body is a Machin of an infinite Number and Variety  of  different  Channels  and  Pipes,  filled  with  various  and  different Liquors  and  Fluids,  perpetually  running,  glideing,  or  creeping  forward,  or returning backward in a constant Circle, and sending out little  Branches and Outlets, to moisten, nourrish, and repair the Experience of living.\n\nCheyne had even sought to give some satisfaction to 'those acquainted with first Philosophy, Natural History, the Laws constantly observed by Bodies in their actions on one another, and the established Relations of Things' {English malady, pp. 4ff.). Clearly, like Boerhaave, Cheyne and Porterfield thought that the general laws of  mechanics were applicable to organic processes; neither thought that any other laws were required. In order  to  understand  how  these  writers  conceived  of  the  limits  of mechanism in explaining organic processes, it is useful to examine how they  related  their  own  views  to  those  of two  of the  most  important philosophical  systems  of  the  seventeenth  and  eighteenth  centuries, namely Cartesianism and Newtonianism.\n\nPorterfield's  clear  rejection  of  Cartesianism  emerged  through  his criticism of Descartes'  attempt to give a purely mechanical account of animal reproduction from the mixture of  fluids of  the male and female of each species. In the formation of  an animal, Porterfield wrote, 'there is a\n\nSee Passions of the soul, arts.  27, 29 {PWD, vol.  i, pp. 338-9).\n\nSee the interesting argument in Nicholas Robinson, A new system of the spleen, vapours, andhypochondriack melancholy (London 1729), pp. 85-6. This originates with Claude Perrault.\n\nnecessity that the Head, Heart, Nerves, Veins and Arteries, should be formed at the same time', not successively, since none of these organs can operate without the others. But this is impossible, 'for no Motion of any Fluid or Fluids, howsoever disposed, can ever form all these at the same instant' . Porterfield also implicitly criticized the pre-formationist theory which was accepted by most contemporary physiologists.^® Since, as these thinkers admitted, some 'active immaterial Cause' is necessary in the first formation of animals, it is puzzling that 'after that, so great Concern should be shewn to reduce all to mere Mechanism'. Why not agree that the operations of the living body continue to have 'Need of new  Impressions  from  some  such  vital  Principle  as  first  set  them a-going' ('Motions of our eyes', II, pp. 219-21)?\n\nThrough  the  use of  the expression 'active immaterial Cause' Porterfield placed his own claim that the vital and natural motions of an animal body cannot be explained entirely mechanically in the context of the  Newtonian  philosophy  of  his  day.  He  cited  (p. 219)  a  note  in Rohault's System of  natural  philosophy, illustrated with Dr. Clarke's notes taken mostly out of Sir Isaac Newton's  philosophy (1723), in which Samuel Clarke stated that perpetual motion on purely mechanical principles is impossible.  Porterfield argued that there can be no  perpetual  motion machine,  because  'there  is  no  avoiding  a  greater  or  lesser  Degree of Friction,  though  the  Machine  be  form'd  according  to  the  exactest Principles of Geometry and Mechanicks' (p. 218).  In making such an appeal he could also have turned directly to the authority of Newton. Newton had claimed in his Opticks that the mechanical motion in the universe is 'always upon the Decay' owing to the 'Tenacity of Fluids, and Attrition of their Parts, and the Weakness of Elasticity in Solids' . He concluded that, since the variety of Motion which we find in the World is always decreasing, there is a necessity of conserving and recruiting it by active Principles,  such as are the Cause of Gravity, by which Planets and Comets keep their Motions in the Orbs, and Bodies acquire great Motion in falling; and the cause of Fermentation, by which the Heart and Blood of Animals are kept in perpetual Motion and Heat.\n\nThere  are  'active  Principles'  in  the  universe  which  are  required  to recruit  the  constant  loss  of motion;  these  principles  are  identified  as being like those which cause perpetual motion in animal bodies.Even more explicitly, in his famous dispute with Leibniz, Newton's spokes­ man Clarke stated that any sort of  increase in motion in nature must arise from 'a principle of  life and activity'.^ *  In insisting on the importance of\n\n- Among them, Boerhaave.

Alexander (Manchester I 95 ® ) &gt;   P -  112.\n\n274\n\nnon-mechanical  active  principles  in  animal  bodies,  Porterfield  was appealing to a doctrine at the heart of Newtonian natural philosophy.\n\nBut Porterfield also distanced himself  from the form of  the Newtonian philosophy which we have seen refiected in Boerhaave. According to this the motions of  an animate body depend on the same active principles, for example elasticity, as other inanimate bodies in the universe. Porterfield wrote that\n\nIf  it should be said, that these Motions do not depend on Mechanism alone, but on Mechanism join'd with certain active Powers or Forces, imprinted by the Author of Nature upon all the Bodies of this Universe, such as are the Powers of Attraction  and  Repulsion,  by  which  the  greatest  Phaenomena  of Nature  are unquestionably produced; it is.incumbent on those who entertain this Opinion, to  explain particularly how these Motions are thus  continued by these active Principles, before they can expect that we should believe them.  (pp. 221-2)\n\nIn his later Treatise, he took issue with what appears to be a variant of this theory which he ascribed to his great Swiss contemporary, Haller. According to Porterfield, Haller held that the irritability which he had discovered to exist in muscle fibres even after they were cut out of the body, like Newtonian gravitation, results from the stimulus acting as a mere occasional cause of the muscular motion. But Porterfield himself held that 'transient and short-lived Motions', such as those excited by stimuli applied to muscles when they are cut out, can be explained purely mechanically {Treatise, vol.  2,  esp.  p.  167).  It  is  only  the  continued operation of  these and other motions in vivo which requires the existence of an active principle.\n\nThe principle postulated by Porterfield is neither the Deity nor some special  active  material  principle  under  the Deity:  it  is  the  individual mind of the organism which acts continually to keep it going throughout life, and even perhaps, as Cheyne had suggested, was responsible for the first  formation  of  the  animal's  body.  Porterfield  presents  a  specific account of the limits of  mechanism. Nothing in his account requires any other  physical  laws  besides  mechanical  ones.  However,  he  clearly rejected the view, supported by Boerhaave as well as Descartes, that the animal body is an automaton. The processes of that body are not selfmaintaining: they require the intervention of  an active principle peculiar to it, which, as we have seen earlier, possesses both intelligence and will.\n\nThe account of this principle places us in the centre of Porterfield's physiological psychology.  For, as we shall see in the next section, the Newtonian ideas about the limits of mechanism and about the necessity for active powers which he adopted could be given an entirely different physiological interpretation. What is central in Porterfield's discussion is  his  anti-Cartesian  view  that  there  is  a  continuous  transition  from\n\nactions which are consciously chosen to those which are done necessarily and without consciousness. On the Cartesian account such actions were interpreted as undergoing a radical transition from being activities of mind  to  being  purely  physical  operations  of the  body  machine.  For Porterfield, they are considered to have their source in a single principle, the mind itself.  Such actions are considered voluntary because they are chosen, at least initially,  for their usefulness.  We cease to be aware of them because they are performed under the influence of custom and habit.  On Porterfield's account, the criteria that an action is under the control of the mind are that it is learned, and that it is originally chosen because of its usefulness.\n\nThe anti-Cartesian nature of Porterfield's central ideas is clear from an examination of their roots. Cullen identified Porterfield as a Stahlian, but I have found no evidence in Porterfield's writing of any influence of Stahl himself. On the other hand, some of Porterfield's main ideas are clearly  taken  directly  from  an  earlier  writer,  the  French  physician Claude  Perrault.^^  Perrault's  ideas,  developed  in  the 1670s,  were certainly  written  against  the  backdrop  of  Cartesianism.  The  close parallel between their arguments reveals that the same concerns which led Perrault to attack Cartesianism in France in the 1670s were still very much  alive  in  Scotland  in  the  1730s,  though  in  the  latter  case  the philosophical  views  opposed  probably  appeared  largely  within  the context of  Boerhaave's physiology. Put generally, these include the view that  the  mind  only  acts  consciously,  that  the  body  machine  is  an automaton, and that the actions of the mind cannot affect the vital and natural operations of the human body. Porterfield, no less than Perrault, directs his theory against these doctrines\n\nOne central doctrine of  Perrault does not appear to have been adopted by Porterfield, namely the anti-Cartesian position that the soul is not only located in the brain but is literally spread throughout the nervous system.  Indeed,  on  this  issue,  Porterfield  does  adopt  the  gerierally accepted  view  rather  than  that  of  Perrault.'*'   However,  a  version  of Perrault's position was central in the work of Robert Whytt, to whoni I shall  now  turn.  It  emerges  naturally  from  his  metaphysical  commit­ ments and experimental work with animals.\n\n- Many authors, including Haller, have considered Perrault to be a forerunner of Stahl (W. H e r m a n n , The theory of Claude Perrault (London 1973), p .  196). 39\n- ^ See  my  account  of  Perrault  in  'The  embodied  soul  in  seventeenth-century  French physiology', forthcoming.\n- For Perrault's view see 'Du toucher', in Claude and Pierre Perrault, Oeuvres diverses de physique et de mechanique, vol. 2 (Leiden 1721), pp. 529 ff-  Stahl apparently located * e  soul m the brain.  His  view is  contrasted with that of Perrault in Haller's notes  to Boerhaave.  See Praelectiones, III, p. 228, note 3.\n\n■2.'I 6\n\n## IV.  WHYTT  AND  THE  SENTIENT  PRINCIPLE\n\nWhytt appears to have entered the University of Edinburgh in  1728 (matriculating Feb.  1729)  and to have been a student in the fledgling Medical  School  in  the  early  1730s.  Some  of his  student  notes  have survived  and  show  that  at  least  one  teacher  associated  with  medical education at that time was critical of Boerhaave's medical philosophy. Part of  Whytt's notebook is based on his studies with Dr George Young, an  adjunct  teacher  who  practised  as  a  surgeon  in  the  city.  Dr  John Boswell, who obtained the notebook after Whytt's death, wrote in the front that he and Whytt were fellow students under Young in 1730-31. According  to  Boswell,  Young  was  'a  great  Sceptick  in  medicine  (&amp; empirick) as well as in every other thing', and 'confin[ed] himself to good  evident  common  sense' .  But  the  notes  show  that  Young  went beyond  scepticism  to  suggest  that  there  are  absolute  limits  to  the application of mechanical laws in the human body, limits which made the  sorts  of  mechanisms  postulated  by  Boerhaave-or  Porterfieldquite superfluous. Moreover, his 'common sense' appears to have led him to suggest that there are special laws which apply to animal bodies as a result of their being animated by a spiritual being.\n\nOf particular interest for our present purposes are notes entitled 'Of muscular motion'  (pp. 43 iff.)  and  'Of Sensation'  (pp.  467ff.).  Whytt headed the first 'An Enquiry into the Cause of muscular Motion, from Mr Youngs papers', and it is a reasonable assumption that,  since the second note continues many of the same themes and is written in the same style, it too is from Young's papers.\n\nIn the first note Young was concerned with the cause of the motion of voluntary  muscles.  Writers  on  this  agreed  that  the  'free  Influx'  of appropriate fluids from the arteries and nerves was a necessary condition for this motion (since when they are tied it cannot occur) and that the 'voluntary motion of the act of  the will is the ultimate cause'. They also assume that the will must use 'some Instrument to Dilate the muscle', and only  disagree  as  to  'what  is  the  Instrument or  Instruments'  by which  this  is  effected  (pp. 431-2).  Young  runs  through  the  various mechanical  and  chemical  hypotheses  of  late  17th-  and  early  18thcentury writers, pointing out that none of them could be supported by any evidence of the senses: 'the great Boerhaave himself never saw his greater Influx of the animal Spirits by which he accounts for muscular motion' (pp. 434-5).\n\nRCPE,  MS.  M9.19.  George  Young  (1692-1757)  was  a  member  of  an  important intellectual society in eighteenth-century Edinburgh called the Rankenian club.  See M.  A. Stewart,  'Berkeley  and  the  Rankenian club',  in George Berkeley:  essays  and replies, ed.  D. Berman (Dublin 1986), esp. pp. 36-7.\n\nYoung did not reject the existence of all mechanisms which cannot be directly perceived by the senses, but he argued that the only basis for postulating such a mechanism is that it is found together with some other phenomenon which we have  discovered to  be  inseparably  connected with  it  in  our  experience.  Thus  he  considered the  objection  that his rejection  of  unobservables  would  lead  to  the  denial  that  the  blood circulates,  since  'we  cannot  trace  it  through  its  smallest  vessels'. Moreover, 'how shall we know that the sun shall rise to morrow or any thing e&lt;ls&gt;e that is future since they are not yet the objects of  our senses? are not  these  sensible  things  that  are  Discoverable  by  our  Reason?' (p. 436).  His  answer  was  that  the  existence  of  these  items  can  be legitimately inferred, only because the relevant 'Phaenomena of Bodys are so Inseparably connected that we never see' one without the other (p. 438). Such inferences are not only sufficient 'to Direct our Conduct throughout our Life' (p. 439), but for science as well. Thus the reason we know that the blood circulates through the invisible tubes is that 'we perceive it to be a piece of the same order which we have formerly seen, where the whole order was perceivable by our senses' (p. 441). This is like the case of tomorrow's stmrise, only more complex.  Since we have observed closed systems wherein fluid circulates, we can conclude that without  such  intermediate  vessels  the  blood  which  flows  to the extremities 'could not flow in such a proportion and not return'. Unless there were such vessels we wquld observe the blood 'Springing out of the  Extremitys'  (p. 444).  The  evidence  of  our  senses  allows  us  to postulate  the  mechanism. But  there is  no such  evidence  where mechanisms are postulated to account for the motion of the muscles.\n\nYoung's  conclusion  is  not  merely  that  we  don't know what  the mechanism is to account for the dilation of the fleshy part of the muscle when we exert our wills,  but rather that there might very well be no hidden  mechanism-that  is,  any  phenomenon  which  is  in  principle capable  of being  sensed.  He  thought  that  the  search  for  mechanical causes  here  is  like  the  case  where  someone  who  has  traced  out  the mechanical connections of the parts of a watch finally ends up enquiring into  the  cause  of the  elasticity  of the  mainspring.  He  might  form  a hypothesis about the general cause of elasticity and 'foolishly conclude' that no other is possible (p. 442). The postulation of a cause in this case would be arbitrary, since the phenomenon has no relation to any known thing. But, more importantly, we need to stop our enquiries somewhere and, if  we don't stop at the connections we can observe, we shall end up pursuing the 'Invisible mechanism  In Infinitum'  (p. 443 )-He asked how we know in the case of  the spring 'that there is some mechanism in it beyond what we see'. He agreed that there is some cause of  the elasticity, but 'how Do we know its a mechanical cause'? Perhaps it is nothing but\n\n278\n\nthe 'will of  God' (p. 445). In the case of  the muscle, there is a dilation of the 'fleshy Belly' of  the muscle which follows on the act of  the will. Here he is willing to allow that 'there must be something which Dilates the Muscle', but 'whether this something be a Phaenomenon that would be perceivable by our senses if more acute or if it be only the act of the will is  what  we  know  nothing  about.  i,e,  we  know  not  if  there  be  any mechanicall cause of the Dilatation of the muscle' (p. 447). Those who consider that any observable mechanical cause we give is  insufficient, and  who  always  seek  another,  are  really  demanding  a  'mechanicall connection betwixt the Soul (or if  you please the will) &amp; a Living body'. They are really leading us 'to the mechanicall operation of the Spirit of man' (p. 449).\n\nIn  'Of  Sensation'   Young  made  clear  his  belief that  the  scientiflc demand for causal mechanisms is really no more than the demand that a given correlation be subsumed tmder a more general law: 'To Explain the mechanism of any particular Phaenomenon is to reduce it to some common  General  Law  of Bodies  own'd  to  be  such  By  every  Body' (p. 470). Young asked why there need be mechanisms in this sense for all phenomena, for there may be a particular order 'only agreeing to two or 3 bodies'. The particular laws of  nervous action may constitute such an order.  We know that when a certain nerve is  stimulated in a healthy person such and such a sensation follows. But no one has been able to formulate a more general law of nervous action of which these laws of specific nerves can be seen as an instance, and therefore 'it would not be absurd  to say  that  perhaps  there  is  no  other  mechanism  in  our sensations' .  It may be 'a particular Law which only agrees to animal bodies while connected with a Spirit' (pp. 467-71).\n\nHence Young combined a rejection of mechanical explanation with a belief that special laws apply to bodies in virtue of their being animated by an immaterial spirit. These philosophical ideas found fertile soil in the mind of  Whytt. But there were, no doubt, other important formative influences on Whytt. He subsequently studied in London, Paris, Leiden (where he is said to have heard the lectures of the then aged Boerhaave), finally  receiving  his  doctorate  in  Medicine  at  Rheims  in  1736.  He returned to Edinburgh, where he began a private practice in  1737.' * ^\n\nWhytt seems to have begun lecturing on the institutes of medicine in the mid-1740s after St Clair took ill; he was appointed professor in 1747. It  is  commonly  accepted  that  he  used  Boerhaave's Institutes as .2^^ textbook,'*^ but he m t^  have treated central Boerhaavian doctrines in\n\nW. Seller, 'Memoir of the life and writings of Robert Whytt, M.D.', Transactions of the Royal  Society  of Edinburgh 23  (1862);  R.  K.  French, Robert  Whytt,  the  soul and medicine (London 1969), chap.  i.\n\nFrench, Robert Whytt, pp. 6-9.\n\na  very  critical  way.  Whytt's Essay, published  in I75i»  contained refutations of many of these doctrines, including Boerhaave's accounts of  the automatic operations of  the heart and lungs. In the Advertisement there was an extended attack on 'the hypothetical method of philoso­ phizing' where 'causes are usually assigned, which not only cannot be proved to  exist, but which are frequently more intricate and complex than even the effects to be explained from them' (Essay, p. vi). It seems likely that many readers would have agpn this as a challenge to much of the contemporary physiology, pre-eminently that of Boerhaave. Whytt called Boerhaave's explanation of  the mechanical operation of  the heart a ^ ' hypothesis' which, 'however ingenious', was quite inadequate (p. 28). He presented a series of  arguments to show its inadequacy. We have seen how  Boerhaave  accounted  for  the  diastolic  motion  of  the  heart  by supposing that the nervous fluids were cut off by the expansion of the auricles at the end of systole.  But Whytt pointed out that not all the icardiac nerves do pass between the auricles and arteries as Boerhaave supposed, and therefore the nervous impulse to the heart could not be completely cut off. Even if all the nerves did take that route, the external coats of  the auricles and arteries are soft and fleshy, and it is not plausible mat the nerves would be compressed to such an exteijt as to cut off  their itapulse to the heart. There are no other examples in the body of  the kind of temporary  paralysis  of muscles  which  Boerhaave  postulated  and, Jwhen  nerves  are  cut  off  by  being  tied,  their  effect  returns  only /gradually-not suddenly, as required by Boerhaave's mechanism for the heart. Whytt gave eight arguments based on anatomical and physiologi­ cal evidence to show that Boerhaave's hypothesis for the mechanical and automatic operation of the heart just won't work.\n\n' On the other hand, in the first edition of  his Essay, Whytt commended the a priori arguments 'proposed with great strength and perspicuity by my ingenious friend Dr. Porterfield' to  show  'that the motion of the heart  and  circulation  of the  blood,  are  altogether  inexplicable  upon principles  purely  mechanical'  (p. 267).  Whytt  seems  to  have  been referring  to  those  general  arguments  based  on  the  impossibility  of a perpetual motion machine which Porterfield had borrowed from Clarke and Newton. But, since he claimed to have a general distrust of a priori arguments, Whytt added 'a variety of arguments a posteriori, chiefly of the analogical kind', which not only show the impossibility of purely mechanical explanations of the vital operations, but also that they are due  to  'the  immediate  energy  of  the  mind  or  sentient  principle (P- 268).\n\nTo support the view that there can be no perpetual motion in animal bodies,  Whytt  first  appealed  to  the  experiments  of  Stephen  Hales, indicating  that  'in  every  circulation,  the  blood  loses  9/10  of  the\n\nmomentum communicated to it by the left ventricle of the heart'. From this Whytt inferred the need for some 'cause generating motion' within the animal body: 'matter, in its own nature inert, is incapable of this'. He also appealed to observations of hibernating animals, which 'lie in a dead inactive state in the winter' but can be revived again at any time with  a  slight  stimulus  of heat  which  slowly  'excites  the  heart  into action' . To support the conclusion that this action cannot be explained mechanically,  ''^ y tt  appealed  to  the  principle  that  a  cause  cannot produce an effect greater than itself. There is 'some living principle' in these animals, which is capable of generating motion when certain parts of the  body,  such  as  the  heart,  are  aroused  by  some  slight  stimulus (pp. 268-9).\n\nWhile Whytt appealed to experience to show that animals generate motion, he also  seems to  rely  on an a priori principle in drawing the conclusion  that  such  motion  cannot  derive  from  the  body  itself.  He assumed with Newton, Clarke, and others that all increase of motion must come from mind, and that matter itself  is inert and passive. There, is no doubt that this is a central thesis of Whytt's book.  It begins with a motto from Cicero's Tusculan disputations which, according to Whytt, shows that some of the ancients believed that all animal motions derive from 'the energy of  a living principle wholely distinct from the body'.'* ^ In Section XI of Whytt's book there is a passage which suggests that he had been following the recent controversy in Europe surrounding La Mettrie's infamous L'Homme machine. Whytt sees a natural progression from the mechanistic principles of Descartes concerning the motions of anim als  to the dangerous doctrines of La Mettrie concerning man as a machine (pp. 291-2). The latter had been a student of Boerhaave and had  produced  the  French  translation  of Praelectiones  academicae.*^ Whytt piously closed his own book with the hope that, by showing that the motions of  our bodies 'are all to be referred to the active power of  an immaterial principle', he will have shown how 'unjustly the study of Medicine  has  been  accused  of  leading  men  into Scepticism  and irreligion' (p. 391). Should  we  not  read  Whytt's  claim  that  self­ movement of animals is due to an immaterial principle as a mere a priori assumption employed to keep medicine theologically respectable?\n\nHowever, if we do not go beyond this conclusion, we shall miss what is  most  distinctive  in  Whytt's  physiological  m etaphy^s.  When  he ascribed  self-motion  as  well  as  other  specific  properties  of  animate nature to the mind, he was giving a positive account of  the phenomena he was trying to  explain, based on a careful reading of the physiological\n\n- See Essay, p. 266, and Cicero, Tusculan disputations, trans.

The key to his analysis of the involuntary motions of animals lies in his claim that they depend upon the mind acting as 'a sentient principle' (p. 271 et passim). We may question the analogies which he used to draw his conclusion that the mind is involved in the involuntary motions of the body, but in order to understand his theory we need to consider with some care the arguments he employed.  The core of his belief  tliat  the vital and other involuntary motions of  a living body cannot be explained mechanically lay in his observation that such motions rely on  the  reaction  of muscles  to  a stimulus. Whytt  held  that  muscular motion was caused either by the will or by a stimulus, and that it is the latter which causes all the involuntary motions.\n\nIn  Section  X  Whytt  carefully  examined  the  current  theories  of muscular contraction-those based on the elasticity of the muscle fibres themselves, on the elasticity of  the unobservable parts of  a nervous fluid, on chemical explosions,  on electricity,  etc.-and pointed out that the actual reaction of the fibres of living tissue to stimuli is quite different from  what  such  theories  would  lead  one  to  expect  (pp. 229ff.).  For example, the alleged spring-like properties of the parts of the muscle or the nervous fluid do not explain why the muscle reacts in so much more violent a way when it is lightly touched with a needle than when it is struck much harder with a blimt object. Why should a spring react in a violent way to acids 'any more than the mildest milk, or oil of  almonds' (p. 231)? We observe no such reaction in springs large enough for us to see. To those who held that muscular contraction results from a chemical explosion or perhaps  from  'the peculiar  energy  of some very  subtile ethereal or electrical matter residing in the nerves', Whytt replied that none  of these  hypotheses  explains  why  the  muscles  react  to  certain stimuli and not others. Gimpowder requires fire and 'electrical effluvia' require a charged object: but neither is necessary for the stimulation of  a muscle. It makes no difference 'whether the stimulating substances be electrics per se, or now-electrics'  (p. 236).  Whytt went on,  in the first edition,  to  attack  the  view  of  Haller  (as  expressed  in  his  notes  to Boerhaave) that the spontaneous motion of  muscles is due to some latent power in the muscles themselves. In this opening shot in his important dispute with Haller about the cause of  muscular movement, Whytt calls this postulation of a latent power 'a refuge of ignorance' (p. 239). He clearly thought, at least initially, that his own explanation, unlike that of Haller, was based on a principle of which we all have direct knowledge. Finally, Whytt considered the general view of those who say that the 'Author of nature' has endowed the muscle fibres with some matter superior to ordinary matter. Here alone, Whytt's reply seems to be based purely  on  a priori  considerations,  when  he  argues  that  to  claim  that matter  'can,  of itself,  by  any  modification  of its  parts,  be  rendered\n\ncapable of sensation, or of generating motion, is equally absurd, as to ascribe to it a power of thinking' (pp. 241-2).\n\nI Whytt thought that any particular response could  be explained by ascribing it to  'an  active  sentient  pr in c ipl e   animating  these  fibres' . Whytt's  sentient  principle  must  be  understood  as  the  source  of  an inherent sensibility in the nerves of the muscles which causes them to react  in  determinate  ways  to  the  stimuli  which  are  applied  to  them. Whytt thought that this could explain why the application of a stimulus to a bare muscle produces 'instead of only one contraction lasting for a considerable  time, several contractions  and  relaxations  alternately ,   succeeding  each  other,  which  become  gradually  weaker,  and  are repeated  after  longer  intervals,  as  the  force  of the  irritating  cause  is diminished'. When first stimulated, the sentient principle 'determines /the influence of the nerves' into the muscle fibres 'more strongly than /   usual',  in  order  to  remove  the  pain.  However,  as the  feeling of pain diminishes,  the  muscle  reacts  less  often;  indeed  'if  by  one  or  two contractions the irritating cause be thrown off, and, together with it, the disagreeable sensation removed, the muscle will return to its former state ; of rest' (pp. 242-3).  Such contractions are not like those of a vibrating I body which 'performs its vibrations in equal times, whether it be acted upon by  a  stronger  or  a  weaker  force'  (p. 247).  Thus  the  particular I nature of the response in removing the irritating cause indicates that , what is operating is a sensible principle.\n\nIn ascribing the response to a sentient principle, Whytt was not merely making the point that the response is generally the most useful one under the  circumstances.  This  was  also  a  common  observation  among  the mechanist writers whom he opposed, and like those writers he held that the involuntary motions of the body could under certain circumstances turn out to be quite harmful (pp. 289-90). Rather, his central point is that the particular nature of the observed response becomes intelligible when it is seen as a reaction to a pain or uneasiness.  For example, 'if stimuli excite  the  muscles  of animals  into  contraction by  acting upon them, rather as sentient than mere mechanical or material organs, it is easy to see, why the mildest aliment is apt to excite vomiting when the coats of the stomach are inflamed' (p. 256). Here the sensibility of the stomach due to the inflammation explains its violent response to the mild food. The muscle reacts in direct response to the feeling'. Similarly, the response of a muscle is very different when the feeling is constant from what it is where the contraction of  the muscle gives some degree of  relief. Thus 'the causes which produce the erection of tht  penis, though they be generally excited into action by the stimulus of  the  ^eed, yet do not act by alternate fits, because the erection has no effect to lessen the stimulating cause'.  On  the  other  hand, musculi  ejaculatoris  seminis act  through alternate contractions and relaxations because through such actions the\n\nirritation  is  gradually  relieved.  These  muscles  relax  for  a  moment because  each  contraction  briefly  lessens  the  uneasy  sensation  of the stimulus (p. 261). In general, we can understand the nature of  muscular action  if  we  consider  the  muscles  to  be  'endued  with  feeling,  and animated by a Sentient principle' (p. 369).\n\nWhytt's  sentient  principle  explains  animal  motions  as  a  direct response  to  the  degree  of  pain  that  is  felt.  His  most  important contribution to  physiology  is  generally  considered to  be  his  work on reflex action. Through careful experimentation he identifled the spinal cord as the locus of  the reflex in the limbs of  the frog, and discovered that there is a period of  inhibitioh-after the frog has been decapitated in which this reflex is delayed. But his explanation of this phenomenon may seem to be more remarkable than the phenomenon itself. In his Physiological essays (1755) Whytt wrote that 'the great pain occasioned by cutting off the head rendered the animal for some time insensible when its toes were wounded'. Thus the frog's mind is too preoccupied with the loss of its head to react to the relatively minor pain of its toes being pinched!  In support, Whytt appealed to Hippocrates' principle that 'a, greater pain destroys, in a considerable degree, the feeling of a lesser one'.'* ^\n\nWhytt collapsed the distinction which Boerhaave had made between the purely automatic motions of the body and those which arise from some 'uneasy sensation' . For Whytt, all muscular motion must be seen as an attempt to get rid of some 'pain or uneasy sensation'.'* *  This was\n\n- * '  Whytt, Physiological essays, third edn.  (Edinburgh  1766), p. 98.  See F.  Fearing, Reflex action (Cambridge, Mass. 1930), pp. 74-83; G. Canguilhem, La Formation du concept de reflexe aux XVIIe et XVIIIe siecles (Paris  1977), pp.  101-7 et passim.\n\n■ * * Essay, p. 243. Cf. pp. 288-9, where Whytt also writes of 'a disagreeable perception', and likens  the  sentient  principle  to  the moral sense 'whence  we approve  of some actions,  and disapprove of others, almost instantly, and without any previous reasoning about their fitness or  unfimess'.  In Medicine  as  culture:  Edinburgh  and  the  Scottish  Enlightenment (Ph.D., University of London  1984),  Christopher Lawrence concludes  from this  that Whytt 'was drawing on the moral philosophy of  Hutcheson or his followers to develop a new conception of the body' (p. 232).  Lawrence has misunderstood the significance and context of the parallel which Whytt drew. He bases his interpretation on Hutcheson's assertion that desires arise in us to obtain an agreeable sensation when we apprehend a good object, or 'to prevent the uneasy Sensation when it is evil' (Francis Hutcheson, An essay on the nature and conduct of  the passions and affections (London  1728), p. 7).  But there is nothing uniquely Hutchesonian about the concept of uneasy sensation. We have already seen the basic idea present in Boerhaave under the heading 'molesta  perceptio' (rendered as 'uneasy sensation' in the English translation of  the early 1740s). It was Locke who suggested that 'the chief if not only spur to Humane Industry and Action is uneasiness' (Essay, II. xx. 6).  Indeed, Hutcheson was probably criticizing Locke when he wrote against those who held that desire is 'Uneasy Sensation upon the Absence of  any Good'. According to Hutcheson, 'Desire is . . . distinct from Uneasiness' (see D. F. Norton, 'Hutcheson's moral realism', Jottma/ of  the history of  philosophy 23 (1985), at p. 401). The same criticism was levelled explicitly against Locke in Carmichael's dictates on pneumatology at Glasgow C.1711-12 (see C. M.  Shepherd, Philosophy and science in the arts curriculum of the Scottish universities in the seventeenth century (Ph.D., University of  Edinburgh 1975), p.  134).\n\nThe significance of  the parallel which Whytt draws between the operation of  his own sentient principle and the moral sense lies in the claim that both operate without reason and reflection. The passage occurs in a context where Whytt is rejecting the Stahlian system which maintains\n\nthe  principle  operating  when,  under  normal  conditions,  the  heart contracts  in reaction to the  stimulus of the returning blood from the veins: the motions of the heart result from the fact that the nerves of the heart  muscles  are  'highly  sensible,  and  the stimulus is  immediately applied  to  them' (Essay, p. 311).  Boerhaave  had  rejected  just  this explanation by denying that there is a distinct sensation in the muscles of the heart; he had noted that if the distinct motions of the muscles were accompanied  by  sensation  we  would  be  in  constant  pain  from  their continuous operation.  There is, in fact, only a general feeling of pain when the tissues of the heart muscle become inflamed (Lectures, 301.6). As we have seen,  Boerhaave tried to  explain  the motion of the heart according to purely mechanical principles which operate independently of the mind.\n\nWhytt argued that his own accotmt of these phenomena was superior to that of the mechanists for two reasons: it avoided multiplying causes unnecessarily, and it explained the phenomena in terms of  a principle the properties of which are directly experienced. According to Whytt, the mechanists  explained  the  reaction  of different  organs  of the  body  to stimuli  by  means  of  different  mechanisms. Thus  on  groimds  of simplicity alone his explanation of all these motions as resulting from variations in the degree of feeling was superior (Essay, p.  265; cf. p. 4). Perhaps even more importantly, while the mechanists and materialists ascribed the movement of  muscles from a stimulus to a 'hidden property of their fibres  . . .   or other unknown cause', he claimed to show how these  movements  are  'easily  and  naturally  accounted  for,  from  the power and energy of a known sentient prin c iple'  (p. 265). While we may lack theoretical knowledge of how the mind affects the body, 'we know from experience, that it feels, is endued with sensation, and has a power of moving the body' (p. 276).\n\nUnlike Yoimg, Whytt did not deny that there was  some 'material cause in the brain, nerves, and muscular fibres' which the mind uses 'as its instrument' for putting the muscles in motion. But he did argue that such  speculations  were  imnecessary,  in  'a  science  already  labouring imder too many hypotheses' (pp. 325-6). vJ\n\nThere was an obvious objection, at least from the point of view of Boerhaavian physiology, to Whytt's claim that sentience is the principle operating in vital and other involimtary motions. For we are commonly not conscious either of  the stimulus or the 'exertion of  the mind's power'\n\nthat everything occurs in the body through a rational principle. Like the mechanists, Whytt is concerned to establish that basic life processes occur spontaneously. Elsewhere he stressed that moral actions must be accompanied with a consciousness of freedom, and that in this respect they are entirely different from the actions from an uneasy sensation which control our vital functions.  See p. 287 below.\n\nin producing the response (p. 299). In breathing, for example, we are not ordinarily conscious of  the stimulus, though we are sometimes conscious of an effort of the mind in producing the action. (Indeed this action is clearly sometimes volimtary.) In other cases, such as the widening of  the pupil of  the eye, we can be conscious of  the stimulus-^the increase in the intensity  of the  light-but not  the  effort  of the  mind  in  moving  the relevant muscles. In the case of the heart, we are not normally conscious of  either the stimulus or the supposed action of  the mind in producing the contraction  of the  muscles.  Is  not  our  lack  of consciousness  a  clear indication that these actions are not performed by the mind? Whytt tried to answer this in Section X of his Essay  .\n\nHe  suggested  that  our  imconsciousness  of the  stimuli  of our  vital motiofts may be due to the fact that we have become habituated to them and that they are relatively gentle (p. 292). Just as we cease to be aware of the impressions of external objects when they become familiar to us, so we become unconscious of those internal stimuli which have affected us since birth. We always have before us a large number of impressions, though most are so  lost  among  stronger and  more novel  ones  'as  to escape  our  attention  and  memory'  (p. 294n.).  But  we  do  become conscious of them when they affect us with greater strength than usual. For example,  'the sensation arising from the impetuous course of the blood through the pulmonary vessels' (p. 294)-which is, according to Whytt,  the  stimulus  for  the  motion  of the  limgs-is  normally  'very slight as not to be felt or attended to' . But it becomes 'very perceptible' to a person suffering from an asthmatic attack, when it is 'accompanied with the most painful anxiety' (pp. 295-6).\n\nSimilarly, Whytt denied that our lack of  consciousness of any effort in the production of the action is proof that it is not produced by the mind. He assumed that anyone would agree that a motion which arises from an idea must be produced by the mind, and went on to note that such actions are often performed without any consciousness: 'As the erection of the penis often proceeds from lascivious thoughts, it must be ascribed, in these  cases  at  least,  to  the  mind,  notwithstanding  our  being  equally imconscious  of  her influence exerted  here, as in  producing  the contraction  of  the  heart'  (p. 301).  Here  one  is  aware  of  the  idea (memory, etc.) which produces the effort of the mind, but not of the effort itself. Whytt also pointed out that the heartbeat can be increased by certain ideas (e.g.  a frightening thought).  In such a case the mind influences the motion of the heart, but we are not 'sensible of its power being directed to that end' (p. 303). Even voluntary motions 'are many times performed, when we are insensible of  the power of  the will exerted in  their  production'-for  example,  when  one  walks  while  deep  in thought, or while talking to another person.\n\n2 8 6\n\n## John P.  Wright\n\nWhytt's claim that the vital motions are performed by an unconscious action of the mind might make one think that he would be quite open to Porterfield's suggestion that these actions are voluntary.  In fact, quite the opposite.  While, in the first edition of his Essay in  1751,  Whytt's remarks on Porterfield's theory were all commendatory, he distanced his views from those of Porterfield in the second edition in 1763. One factor may have been Porterfield's own criticism of  Whytt in his Treatise on the eye in  1759.  In  1763  Whytt  in  turn  criticized  Porterfield,  'a  subtile defender of the Stahlian doctrine'.'* '\n\nIn his first edition Whytt had criticized the view of the Stahlians that the mind acts as 'a rational agent' in bringing about the vital and other involuntary motions:\n\nWe think it a very clear point, that the mind does not, as Dr. Stahl and others would persuade us, preside over, regulate, and continue the vital motions, or, upon extraordinary occasions,  exert its  power in redoubling  them,  from  any rational views, or from a consciousness that the body's welfare demands her care in these particulars.\n\nHe denied that the mind can rationally control the heartbeat 'when life is  endangered  by  the  too  violent  circulation  of the  blood'.  Rational action  must  take  place  with  consciousness,  and,  since  we  have  no consciousness  of  bringing  about  the  vital  motions,  they  cannot  be performed with reason. According to Whytt, when one acts rationally one  compares  different  alternatives,  and  'in  consequence  of  this comparison' makes a certain choice. But the comparison of alternatives is  a  comparison of ideas, and  'we  cannot but be sensible of the ideas formed  within  us  by  the  internal  operations  of our  minds'.  Unlike sensations,  ideas  exist  only  as  long  as  we  are  conscious  of  them (pp. 285-7).\n\nIn  his  first  edition  Whytt  had  briefly  dismissed  the  view  that  our inability  to  control  the  muscles  of the heart  was  due  to  their having become, like the motion of  the eyes, 'in a manner necessary through long habit'  (p. 286).  In  the  second  edition  he  specifically  identified  this argument  as  that  of  Porterfield.^®  Whytt  argued  for  an  essential difference between muscles like those which control the movements of our eyes and those like the heart:\n\nBut although custom may enable us to perform some actions with surprising facility and little or no attention, yet it will not render the motions of muscles absolutely involuntary, which were originally voluntary.-There is no instance in the human body of any muscle, whose motion can be fairly proved to have\n\n- Whytt, An essay on the vital and other involuntary motions of  animals, 2nd edn. (Edinburgh 1763), P343 n.\n\nEssay (1763), p. 341, paraphrasing from Treatise on the eye, vol.  2, p.  149.\n\nbeen voluntary in the beginning of  life, that has by custom or habit become so fair independent on the will,  as to  be  in no  degree under its  immediate  controul. {Essay (1763), p. 341)\n\nThus, while  I cannot help but move my two eyes together, I  still can decide the speed at which to move them, and the direction.  I have no such control over the motions of  my heart, or the peristaltic motion of  my stomach and guts. Thus there is no reason to think that the actions of these muscles were originally voluntary.\n\nWhytt also took issue with Porterfield's claim that while there was no physical necessity involved in actions performed by custom and habit, there  is  a  'moral  necessity' .  According  to  Whytt,  morally necessary actions must be sufficiently voluntary to allow one to praise or blame the agent, and in order for this to be legitimate they 'must be attended with a consciousness of  liberty' . This consciousness is lacking in the case of  our heartbeat,  or  the  peristaltic  motions  of our  stomach  or  guts.  In  his Pathological Lectures Whytt  told his students that Porterfield's argument that the mind is not conscious of its volitions in producing such motions was based on a 'metaphysical Subterfuge'.^ *\n\nBut Whytt's chief objection to Porterfield's explanation of our lack of control over the vital motions was based on the fact that there is a much more  plausible  explanation.  Even  voluntary  muscles  come  to  move involuntarily when their 'fibres or nerves are irritated' {Essay (1763)5 p. 342).  We  find  throughout  the  animal  body  that  stimuli  produce involuntary motion through an irritation of their sensitive parts. This is clearly the explanation for the fact that the vital and natural motions of our visceral organs are carried out without any sort of  voluntary control.\n\nWhile  Porterfield  and  Whytt  both  rejected  the  Boerhaavian  or Cartesian theory which denied that the mind operates in governing the vital and natural operations of the body, their positive accounts are very different. Whytt's view is that the mind in producing the vital and other involuntary motions, does not act as a rational, but as  a  sentient  principle;  which,  without reasoning  upon  the  matter,  is  as necessarily  determined  by  an  imgrateful  sensation  or stimulus affecting  the organs, to exert its power, in bringing about these motions, as is a balance, while, from mechanical laws, it preponderates to that side where the greatest weight prevails. {Essay, p. 289)\n\nLike the mechanists, Whytt held that those motions which take place independently of the conscious will take place necessarily. They follow as a 'necessary  and  immediate  consequence  of  the  disagreeable\n\n- V  EUL, MS. Gen. 745D, fol. 4.

Neither the means nor the goal of such actions is chosen by the mind which performs them.  Rather, the Deity has  so formed the mind-body connection that 'in consequence of a stimulus affecting any organ, or of an uneasy perception in it' our minds 'immediately excite such motions . . .  as may be most proper to remove the irritating cause' (p. 288).\n\nPorterfield questioned the significance of ascribing body motions to the  'Energy  and  active  Power  of the  Mind'  if those  motions  occur necessarily.^^ He noted that according to Whytt the vital  and natural motions of  the body are 'altogether involtmtary' and are 'not subjected to the Will' ; that in performing these supposed actions the mind 'has no Views,  . .  .  proposes  no  End,  .  .  .  acts  without  Choice'  and  'without Preference  or  Election' .  Porterfield  argued  that  there  is  no  point  in saying that such motions  are 'caused by  the Mind' if,  in  spite  of the addition of sentience, they come about 'by a Law established by the All­ wise Creator' (Treatise, vol.  2, p.  162).\n\nIt is tempting, when one thinks about Porterfield's criticism of  Whytt, to conclude  that, because  he  held  that  the  vital  motions  occur necessarily, there is essentially no difference between his physiological views and those of Boerhaave.  In fact, in a certain respect Porterfield's physiology is far closer to that of Boerhaave than that of Whytt. As we have seen, Porterfield no less than Boerhaave described the body itself  as a hydraulic machine. Whytt, on the other hand, held that one 'must not consider the body as an inanimate hydraulic Machine which stops when one pipe is obstructed, but as composed of exquisitely sensible tubes'. Unlike Porterfield and Boerhaave, Whytt held that the basic principle of animal motion is feeling.\n\nThq difference between Porterfield's and Whytt's explanations of the motions of animal bodies comes out clearly in their differing accounts of the motions of  muscles separated from the brain. In the last section of  his Essay Whytt had presented a remarkable range of cases describing 'the motions  observed  in  the  muscles  of  animals  after  death,  or  their separation from the body' . He realized that some would think that such phenomena  show  that muscles  operate  independently  of the  soul  or sentient principle, but he argued that this is not the case. Since muscles separated from the rest of the body continue to operate in the same way that  they  do  in  the  body,  they  'bespeak  a  feeling,  and  cannot  be explained  without  it' .  Unless  we  assert  that  feeling  is  a  property  of matter we must admit that the sentient principle continues to operate in them (Essay, pp. 389-90).  Whytt  claimed  that  this  is  a  conclusion supported 'by the strongest analogy' (p. 388). But Porterfield argued\n\n- Treatise on the eye, vol. 2, p.  162; cf. Whytt, Essay, p. 302,\n- 'Whytt's clinical lectures  1762-1764': RCPE, MS. Whytt 2, fol. 2.  Italics are mine.\n\nthat Whytt's  account of such motions  was  less  plausible than that of Albrecht von Haller (Treatise, vol. 2, pp.  165-6).  Indeed,  as we have seen,  Porterfield  himself argued  that  such  transient  and  short-lived motions could be explained in a purely mechanical way. In the second edition of his Essay Whytt responded by pointing out that some of these motions were hardly ephemeral:\n\nif  the motions of  a viper' s heart for three days after its head has been cut off, and those of  the heart of a tortoise for six months after the loss of its brain, may be owing to a mechanical power resulting from their particular structure, why may not the motions of the heart in these as well as all other animals, from the beginning  to  the  end  of life,  be  owing  to  mechanism alone}  (Essay (1763), p. 43  m.)\n\nWhytt argued that there is an inherent inconsistency in a view which demands the volvmtary control of vital actions during the lifetime of the organism,  but  is  willing  to  allow  that  they  can  take  place  purely mechanically after destruction of the brain.\n\nHpwever, as Whytt himself recognized, his own view that the motions of separated muscles are under the control of the sentient principle was not  itself  without  problems. In  Section  XI  he  had  favoured  the hypothesis  that  'the  involuntary motions  in man  are not owing  to  a principle distinct froni the rational mind', on two grounds-^that the motions of voluntary muscles can themselves become involuntary, and that in man it is clearly the same principle which is conscious of  thinking and of feeling (pp. 282-5). In general, Whytt favoured the view that the soul is a unity. But, as we have just seen, he also maintained that the soul or living principle does not leave the body immediately after the brain is destroyed  and  conscious  function  ceases.  Does  this  not  show  the independence  of the  thinking  and  sentient  principles?  Moreover,  in holding that the soul is responsible for the motions of  separated muscles, Whytt implied that it continues to act in spatially discrete nerves. Should he not have concluded that there were different  souls  in the  discrete parts?  But  Whytt  argued  that  experiments  with  hibernating  animals showed that the soul acts independently in different parts, even though the  brain  itself  is  dormant.  Moreover,  anyone  who  examines  the structure and function of  the brain will find implausible the view that the mind occupies a single indivisible point. Whytt cited an impressive list of authorities-including Gassendi, Newton, and Clarke-who held that a single unified soul can exist in extended parts. Just as the Deity can act independently in different parts of  space without in any way losing unity or  indivisibility,  so  there  can  be  independent  operation  of the  same unified soul in the scattered parts of animals after death. Any residual problems with this idea he put down to our ignorance of 'the nature of\n\n290\n\nan immaterial substance, its manner of existing, and way of acting upon, or being present with the body' (pp. 377-84).\n\nWhytt's view that the motions of separate muscles must be due to a soul or sentient principle took on a special significance in the dispute with Haller,  which broke out after the  publication of Whytt's Essay. Haller  supported  an  even  more  radical  form  of automatism  than  his teacher Boerhaave. In the notes to his edition of Boerhaave, Haller had asserted in opposition to his teacher that 'the heart is moved by some unknown cause, which neither depends upon the brain nor the arteries, but  lays  concealed  in  the  very  structure  of the  heart  itself' .^ '*   Like Whytt, Haller held that the motion of  the heart was due to the irritability of the heart muscle in  response to  the  return of venous  bl ood. But Haller claimed that irritability is due to a 'physical cause which depends upon the arrangement of the ultimate particles' of the animal gluten of the muscles-though he maintained that, like gravity, the actual cause of the motion is not perceivable ('Sensible and irritable parts', p. 692). Like Boerhaave, Haller asserted that there is a mechanical cause of  the motion of the  heart,  though  he  refused  to  speculate  on  its  exact  nature.  He also  maintained  that  there  can  be  no  feeling  without  consciousness (pp. 677-8). But he went further than Boerhaave in maintaining that the I basic motion of the heart and other such organs is not only independent of  the mind, but also independent of  the whole nervous system. T   aken in this context, Whytt's view that the vital and other involxmtary motions of animals  are  caused  by  the  sentient  principle  came  to  have  a  twofold significance. On the one hand, it signified the dependence of all motions of  muscles on feeling; on the other, it signified the general dependence of such  motions  on  the  nervous  system.  Whytt's  dispute  with  Haller touched on both issues.^®\n\nMuch of the argument on both sides turned on the question of the correct explanation of the motions of muscles which were cut off from the  influence  of the  brain.  Haller argued that these  depended on the irritability of the muscle fibres due to their own vis insita, while Whytt ■ argued that irritability depended on the nervous power which remained in  their  nerves.  Each  brought  an  impressive  array  of experiments  to support his view. Whytt distinguished the metaphysical issues involved from the issue concerning the anatomical source of the living principle.\n\n- '   Albrecht von Haller, 'A dissertation on the sensible and irritable parts of animals', with introduction by Owsei Temkin, Bulletin of the history of medicine 4 (1936), at p. 694.

In the last edition of his Physiological essays in  1766, Whytt noted that even someone who  held  that  the  powers  of the  nerves  are  'owing  to  the particular disposition and arrangement of the matter of which they are composed'  could  adopt  his  view  on  the  relation  of  irritability  to sensibility (pp. 244-5).  He thought that a good portion of his dispute with Haller could be settled by an agreement that life is due to a single nervous power which can be retained for a limited time in the nerves of the muscles after they are separated from the rest of the body.\n\nNevertheless  it  is  also  true  that  much  of the  dispute  hung  on  the differing conceptions of mind adopted by Whytt and Haller.  Haller's most  important  metaphysical  challenge  to  Whytt's  view  was  clearly stated  in  his 1753  paper De  partibus  corporis  humani  sensilibus  et irritabilibus. He noted that Whytt had 'found himself obliged to admit the divisibility of  the soul, which he believes to be separable into as many parts  as  the  body'.  Haller  observed  that  when  the  intestines  were quickly removed from a small animal and cut into four or eight pieces, all moved separately and responded individually to an irritation. He did not think it made sense to maintain, with Whytt, that the soul continues to operate in all of them independently.  In general.\n\nThe soul is a being which is conscious of itself, represents to itself the body to which it belongs, and by means of that body the whole universe. I am myself, and not another, because that which is called I, is changed by every thing that happens to my body and the parts belonging to it. . .  . But a finger cut off from my hand, or a bit of flesh from my leg, has no connexion with me.  I am not sensible of any of its  changes,  they  can neither  commimicate to me  idea nor sensation; wherefore it is not inhabited by my soul nor by any part of it; if  it was, I should  certainly  be  sensible  of its  changes.  ('Sensible  and  irritable  parts', pp. 677-8)\n\nIn this discussion Haller identified self and soul, and denied that there can  be  activity  of  soul  without  consciousness.  The  soul  cannot  be operating in the separated muscles of the body as Whytt claimed, for it does not feel the irritation of those muscles.\n\nIn response to the first part of Haller's criticism, Whytt repeated his claim that the soul need not be divisible, even though it continues to exist in the scattered parts: an 'immaterial substance cannot, like the body, be divided by the anatomical knife,  and  . .  .  the indivisibility of the soul does not depend on the unity of that body which it animates, but on its own  particular  nature' (Physiological  essays, p. 242).  Unfortunately Whytt never really explains the significance of  this unity of  the soul itself after all conscious functions cease, beyond what he had already set forth in his Essay.\n\n292\n\nIn response to the second part of Haller's objection, Whj^t made an important distinction between the nature of feeling as  it exists in the periphery of  the nervous system and as it exists in the brain. He held that it  is  probable  that,  even  in  living  animals,  the  soul  is  'present  every where in the body', and that 'there may be some kind of feeling or sensation excited in the nerve  itself'  which  causes  the response to a stimulus  (p.  I55n.).  Whytt  carefully  distinguished  the  location  of 'simple sensation' from that of sensation accompanied with conscious­ ness. Thus the soul 'can only taste in the tongue, smell in the nose, see in the eyes, hear in the ears, and feel hunger in the stomach'. On the other hand, it exercises the power of 'reflex consciousness and reason' only in . the brain. Consciousness is due to a 'reflex act, by which a person knows his thoughts or sensations to be his own' . When communication with the  brain  is  cut off,  the  part  of the  body  can  still  retain  its  power  of sensation through the peripheral nerves and so react for a time to stimuli. But it is no longer able to communicate that sensation to the brain where it can become conscious (pp.  1558). In a footnote to the final edition of his Essay Whjrtt referred to the sensation which is retained in the parts of  muscles separated from the rest of  the nervous system as 'some kind of feeling or simple sensation (such as oysters or other animals of  the lowest class, who have no brain are endued with)' (Essay (1763), p. 433n.).\n\nThe metaphysical issue between Whytt and Haller turns largely on their different conceptions of the soul. For Haller, like Boerhaave, the essence of the soul is to be conscious. For Whytt, the soul is essentially that which gives life to the body and which is only conscious in so far as it performs its operations in the brain. As we have seen, Whytt thought that his contemporaries rejected his view of the soul partly because they still retained Cartesian principles, and partly because they had become too enamoured of mechanical reasoning in physiology. Perhaps Haller's imwillingness  actually  to  give  a  mechanical  accoimt  of the vis  insita blunted  the  force  of the  second  part  of this  criticism,  but  the  first remained entirely relevant to their dispute. Whytt rejected that form of Cartesian dualism which maintained that the vital and other involuntary motions of animals are independent of the thinking principle-the view which was most forcefully set out by Haller. In his account of  the soul or mind Whytt reaffirmed its essence as the principle of life and maintained the centrality of feeling as the root of all life processes.\n\n## V.  CULLEN'S  GEOGRAPHY  OF  THE  MIND\n\nIn 1766, after Whytt's early death, William Cullen resigned his position as  professor  of Chemistry  at  the  University  of Edinburgh,  and  was\n\n'\n\nappointed professor of the Theory of Medicine.  Over the next seven years he gave five year-long courses of lectures on physiology.'  In 1772 he  published his Institutions of  Medicine, containing only short propositions, which were discussed at length in his lectures. In the latter, Cullen considered the physiological views of  a number of  his contempor­ aries, especially Whytt, Haller, and Jerome Gaub. His own views are not always  easy  to  discover,  because  he  employed  a  sceptical  style  of reasoning, balancing one contemporary doctrine against another. But, like  Hume,  Cullen  was  an academic sceptic  who  used  this  type  of reasoning to reach conclusions which he thought highly probable He provided a dialectical synthesis of his predecessors'  views by applying what Hume had called 'mental geography' (E.  13)-that is, through a careful  analysis  of the  powers  of the  mind.  It  was  through  such  an analysis  of sensation  and  volition,  albeit  one  which  rested  partly  on Cartesian principles, that Cullen showed the extent and nature of the interaction between mind and body.\n\nAs I indicated in section I, Cullen regarded this mutual interaction as of major concern to physiology. In what appears to be a supplementary private  note  on  his  lectures  from  the  mid-1760s,  he  wrote  that  the problem of the action of the mind on the body reduces to the problem 'how one State of the body or of one part can affea another part of it'. He identified the mental states or faculties as 'thought. Intellect &amp; will' . The  reason  they  had  been  generally  ascribed  to  'a  Substance  very different  from our bodies'  is  that the mechanism  by  which  they  are produced 'is not &lt;at&gt; all obvious'. Nevertheless, he pointed out that they are clearly 'inseparable from some conditions in the body'. Cullen adopted the doctrine of  two substances and their connection espoused by Boerhaave and Haller, who had never been 'Suspected of irreligion', but  this  dualism  and  the  problems  connected  with  it  were  of  little intellectual  concern  to  him.  The  important  problem  concerning  the influence  of mind  on  body  was  a  problem  of how  certain  states  of the brain-namely mental ones-affect those of other organs such as the heart:  'This  is  a problem to  the  Solution  of which we  may  hope to attain.''\n\nWhytt and Porterfield had opposed Boerhaave's view that the essence of  mind or soul is to be conscious. It is therefore striking to discover that, in  spite  of his  alleged  opposition to the  system of Boerhaave,  Cullen\n\n- Thomson, Life of Cullen (note 6 above), vol.  I, p. 458.\n- 5 *   On Cullen's recommendation of 'the slow consenting Academic Doubt', see J.  R. R. Christie, 'Ether and the science of chemistry', in Conceptions of ether, ed. G. N. Cantor and M. J. S. Hodge (Cambridge 1981), esp. p. 92. Christie ties this academic scepticism with that of Hume, stressing the importance of a cautious acceptance of hypotheses-especially that of the aether-for both thinkers.\n- »  'Lectures on physiology': RCPE, MS. Cullen 16(1), preliminary folios.\n\n294\n\nfollowed him in holding that consciousness characterizes what is mental. This is clear from his analysis of the concept of sensation. In his lectures in  the  fall  of  1770,  Cullen  said  he  followed  Hume  in  distinguishing sensations from ideas -that is, from the thought of 'an Object absent arising  from  Reminiscence'.  A  sensation  is  a  thought  which  arises directly from an 'external Impression or certain other Changes in the Body'. Cullen went beyond Hume (and Whytt) in carefully distinguish­ ing sensations from impressions-that is, from the motions in the body which are their causes.*® Cullen defined 'sensation' in general as 'the Mind's being conscious of any changes in the State of the body, or more nearly of the Nervous System' (fols. 89-90, my italics). In proposition 49 of his Institutions he asserted (with Haller) that the mind can have or attend to only one sensation at a time, thus rejecting Whytt's suggestion that the mind can have a number of unconscious sensations at any given moment.  Finally,  in  his  1770  lecture  on  proposition  122,  he  stated plainly that 'to say there is  Sensation without Consciousness is to me almost a Contradiction in Terms' (fol.  160).\n\nUnlike Whytt, Cullen held that processes of the body can take place purely automatically-that is, without being accompanied by any mental state. Herein we see the significance of  his distinction between sensations and impressions. In proposition 80 he asserted that 'certain impressions and certain states of the body  . . .  may  . . .   act on the nervous  system without producing any sensation' ; and in proposition 122, that 'many impressions have their affects without sensation and volition'.  Indeed he  held  that  fundamentally  our  vital  and natural  motions  are  of this nature. In proposition 119 he maintained that 'the motions of the heart and arteries, of the organs of respiration, of the stomach, intestines and perhaps other parts'  are caused by  'certain internal impressions  .. . which produce no  sensation,  nor motions  of which we are  conscious except  when  exercised  in  an  unusual  manner' .® '  Cullen  did  accept Whytt's view (opposed to Haller) that the motions of  muscles are always\n\nAfter distinguishing sensations from ideas, Cullen wrote: 'In this point I follow David Hume; he indeed uses the Term Impression instead of Sensation, but I employ Impression in another place  I  think more  properly, nor would  Impression  convey the whole meaning of Sensation,  but only  as  far as  it  arises  from the body.'  (NLS  Cullen,  fol. 80).  On Whytt's interchangeable use of 'impression'  and 'sensation'  see sect.  IV above.\n\nIn an article which is widely referred to ('The nervous system and society in the Scottish Enlightenment', in Natural order: historical studies of scientific culture, ed.  B.  Barnes and  S. Shapin (Beverly Hills 1979), 19-40), C. Lawrence cites this passage to support the conclusion that Cullen 'retained all the characteristics of Whytt's sentient principle-purposeful action, coordinating ability, and, most importantly, unconscious feeling -without introducing second substances into physiology' (p. 26, my italics).  I can see how this passage could be read as Lawrence reads it when taken out of the context of the rest of  the Institutions, but I cannot see how it can be so read in the context of propositions 80,  122, and numerous comments in the lecture notes. For reasons set out in the last section I also consider quite misleading Lawrence's view that Whytt thought the vital motions are carried out through any 'purposeful action'.\n\ndue to some form of nervous power, and he stressed that in the living body they require a constant energy from the brain (props.  96, 97).® * However, he drew an entirely different metaphysical conclusion from Whytt's. For Cullen, the fact that 'some of the Functions of  our System can be performed without Sensation or Volition' gives 'a strong Proof of the Brain's  being a Mechanical  Organ'  (NLS  Cullen,  fol.  1465  cf. Institutions, prop.  116).\n\nIn  proposition  122  Cullen  balanced  this  against the  claim  that the mechanism of the  brain  is  insufficient  'without  being  united  with  a sentient  principle  or  mind  that  is  constantly  present  in  the  living System'. He argued for this partly on epistemological grounds, because 'the mechanism of the brain suited to its several functions is not at all perceived'. Unlike Boerhaave, Cullen did not think that mental states are, for practical purposes, reducible to their mechanical causes. But he also gave a more positive reason: very few of the functions of the brain are 'carried out without sensation and volition'  (prop.  122). Here he appears to agree with Whytt's claim that the sentient principle operates throughout the body. We need to consider how this is reconcilable with Cullen's assertions about vital and natural motions which we considered in the last paragraph.\n\nWhile  Cullen  appealed  to  the  authority  of Whytt  in  support  of a sentient principle, he took issue with Whytt's view that sensation takes place  in  the  peripheral  nervous  system,  apart  from  the  brain  itself (NLM, II, fol. 243). But their different accounts of the operation of the sentient principle go deeper than that.  Since Cullen identified mental functions with conscious ones, he held that basic life functions can go on independently of the mind.  At the  same time he criticized Whytt for holding with Boerhaave that our visceral fvmctions are carried on with an absolute  necessity,®^  without  any  kind  of influence  by  the  conscious mind.  For  Cullen,  the  sentient  principle  influences  our  basic  life functions, but as an independently identifiable principle whose effects on those functions  can be determined by experience.  While he began from a basic acceptance of  what I earlier called ftmction dualism, Cullen asked himself just how those  states  of the  nervous  system which  are mental interact with those on which our basic life functions depend.\n\nCullen  regularly  returned  to  what  he  called  the  ' Stahlian  contro-\n\nCullen  seems  to  adopt  the  position  suggested  by  Whytt  in  the  last  edition  of  the Physiological essays, discussed in section IV above. . . . · u-\n\n'But to understand Boerhave you must observe this Application of these Doctrines to his System in his Definition of Disease, where he says the  Consideration of the Mind is to be neglected.  . . .  He explains this still more particularly . . . where he expressly says Omne hoc pendet &amp;c.----- mechanica dispositio. . . .   I  join with Boerhave, Dr Whytt, who after taking much pains in his Vital Functions, to prove the Existence of  a Sentient Principle.. . thinks that all our Motions are directed by a Physical Necessity.' (NLS Cullen, fol. 76).\n\n296\n\nversy'-the question whether the mind volimtarily directs the vital and natural motions  of the body.  At the  beginning  of his  lectures  on the nervous  system,  he  said  he  was  following  Gaub  in  subscribing  to  a compromise between the view of Boerhaave and Whytt on the one hand and that of the  Stahlians on the o t h e r . T o  imderstand this we must examine his mental geography of volition-that is, his account of the extent and manner in which the mind can be said to have control over our bodies.\n\nIn proposition 119, Cullen listed seven causes of  the action of  the brain in  bringing  about  changes  in  the  body,  five  of which  are  said  to  be 'modes of volition' (NLM, III, fol. 49). These include the operation of the  will  in  performing  voluntary  actions,  the  passions,  imitation, appetites  directed  to  external  objects,  and  propensities  to  remove  an uneasy sensation.  In arguing that 'some Volition is concerned' in the last of these, Cullen gave an idea of just what he meant by 'volition'. A typical case of a propensity which arises from an 'uneasy sensation' is the voiding of  urine and faeces. In such cases the relevant motions 'can often be prevented by another volition presenting itself  ', and we can put forward greater or less effort in exercising them {Institutions^ H9-5)-\n\nThe Excretion of Urine is often very urgent, yet a Lady in company with men will restrain this Propensityj neither will a well bred Man expel wind by the Anus in company with Ladies; he can restrain it. ... [A] Man in going to Stool .. .in pressing  out Faeces.. .holds his Breath in  order to give a greater  Effort, &amp; if it is still more difficult, he grins most horridly. (NLS Cullen, fol. 152)\n\nThe number of muscles  which  come  into play  is  determined  by  the degree of effort which is put forth (NLM, II, fols. 271-2). While Cullen did  not  deny  that  motions  from  an  uneasy  sensation  are  sometimes caused without any volition-that is, without the ability to do otherwise or to put out greater or less effort-the paradigm is those in which some volition  is  involved.  In  contrast,  we  should  remember  that  Whytt postulated a sentient principle to explain those involuntary motions of the body which, according to him, were necessarily determined by the uneasy sensation.\n\nVolitions, in Cullen's wide sense, constantly affect our vital functions. While the basic motions of my heart and lungs are carried out purely mechanically, they are constantly affected by my passions, i.e.  'more general and vehement volitions' {Institutions, 119.2). There is 'nothing more evident than that the passions of the mind affect the motion of the\n\n^ NLS Cullen, fols. 76-7. For Gaub's views on mind and body see L. J. Rather, Mind and body in eighteenth-century medicine (Berkeley  1965).  Rather stresses the difference  between Gaub's view of  the passions and that of  Descanes. For Gaub,like Ponerfield and Cheyne, they are actions of the mind. This view seems to be shared by Cullen.\n\nheart'-for example, anger will produce a violent beating of the heart and  grief  will  slow  it  down  (NLM,  II,  fol. 274).  Though  Cullen considered the passions to be 'modifications of the will', he noted that they are generally instinctive in so far as they arise directly in response to a certain sensation. When we are angry, even the outward motions of  our bodies  often  arise  without  our  having  much  awareness  of  them. However, Cullen also stressed that when our passions are not too violent we have some degree of conscious control over the relevant motions.\n\nBut it is not only those volitions which are essentially instinctive which affect our vital motions  i some are also constantly affected by what are clearly volimtary actions. Cullen wrote that 'there is no proof of  any one muscle of the body being more under the power of the will, than the action of respiration' (NLM, II, fol. 273). The rate and manner of my breathing is affected by a number of my voluntary actions,  including talking.  Does  this  not mean that  Cullen followed Porterfield  and  the Stahlians in holding that we have voluntary control over the vital and natural motions of our bodies?\n\nCullen's mental geography of the will consisted of  two elements, both basically Cartesian. First, he held that the will is a mode of thought and that what we will is only that which we are immediately conscious of willing.®^ In bodily motions subjected to the will 'the Mind only wills an End.. . . We know nothing of  the particular muscles put in action. When I bend my arm, I commonly only attend to the contraction of the Biceps, but Winslow has shewn that many other Muscles partake in that Action' (NLS Cullen, fol.  161: cf. Institutions, prop.  119.1). Cullen denies that we have anything but a very limited and general consciousness of the parts of  our bodies moved, and draws the conclusion that we will only the general movements of a limb or muscle.\n\nRelated to this is his  second  Cartesian principle, that 'in the moral Administration of the System only a general end or purpose is in view, &amp; the Almighty Creator has connected certain Motions with the  Volition of these Ends' (NLS Cullen, fol.  161; my italics).  Thus there are certain motions of  our body naturally or originally connected with the willing of certain general goals or purposes. To take Descartes' own example, 'if we want to adjust our eyes to look at a far-distant object, this volition causes the pupils to grow larger' {PWD, vol. i, p. 344). I cannot directly will the bodily motions, but only certain general conscious aims to which they are naturally joined. Both Descartes and Cullen held that through custom and habit these original connections of ideas and bodily motions\n\nFor Descartes' view see PWD, vol. 2, p.  113, Def.  I .  This new translation of Descartes' works unhelpfully translates the Latin 'immediate conscii sumus' by 'we are immediately aware'. As McRae and Rodis-Lewis (note 16 above) show, Descartes was using 'conscii' in a new and important way which became fundamental in modern philosophy.\n\n2 9 8\n\ncould be changed so that the willing of a quite different idea could bring about the relevant bodily change.\n\nFrom these two principles Cullen concluded that, while my passions or even my voluntary actions affect the vital motions, it is not in the way that  the  Stahlians  thought.  In  general,  we  do  not  directly  will  the motions of individual muscles, nor do we have any distinct conscious­ ness of bodily sensations. While he accepted Porterfield's and Perrault's claim  that  the  uniform  motion  of our  eyes  was  originally  voluntary (NLM, II, fols.  lo i- i I ; cf. Institutions, prop. 55), he did not accept that certain motions of muscles were chosen over others in order to achieve the goal of forming a distinct image of the object. Rather, it was merely by willing the general end of seeing objects distinctly that the motions of the  muscles  became  uniform.  Moreover,  most  of  us  have,  through custom  and  habit,  come  to  perform  this  action  completely  without consciousness,  and hence the mind is  no  longer  involved  in  it  (NLS Cullen, fol.  153).\n\nCullen  held  that  many  motions  which  we  may  consider  to  be involuntary, including vital and natural ones, are not entirely so. But he showed  exactly  how  such  motions  can  be  a  matter  of voluntary  and rational choice.  In his  1772 lecture on proposition 119, Cullen told his students that he differed from other physiologists with regard to  'the extent of  the powers of  the mind or with regard to the manner of  acting' . He distinguished the question whether the visceral motions are affected by the mind from the question whether they are 'directed' by the mind. Consideration  of  the  passions  and  unintended  effects  of  voluntary actions  shows  that  the  motions  of our  internal  organs  are  constantly affected by the mind. However, like Porterfield and Cheyne, Cullen held that vital  motions  such  as  those of the heart  can be  'directed by the mind',  though  for  him  it  is  only 'in  one  limited  sense'' ' (NLM,  II, fol. 287). The mind controls the body through conscious rational choice. The question is how, through conscious choice of a certain means to end relation, we might be able to control the motion of our heart and other internal organs.\n\n■   Cullen maintained that when we are calm we have some control over our passions through imagination, and that in so far as the passions are voluntary  both  these  and  the  internal  motions  of our  bodies  are  also under our control. Clearly, we can under certain circumstances control our  passions  by  directing  our  thoughts  in  a  certain  way-that  is,  by choosing to think of  certain objects with which our passions are naturally joined. We have 'a power whereby we can recall these objects that give us anger or fear'.  Cullen recalled that\n\nThere is a famous instance of Colonel Townshend by Dr. Cheyne who stopped his  heart  at  pleasure  and  died  when  he  thot  proper.  I  can  explain  it.  .  .  .  By\n\nrecollecting an object of  fear we can diminish its action, and [by some such way as this] Colonel Townshend had power over his heart. So have no doubt that we can by recalling one or other of  these passions make it voluntary, and if  you will a certain end, it has the power of  exciting a variety of  actions and combining these together, at the same time the heart.\n\nThus the mind can control the motion of the heart. Cullen's idea is that Townshend was able to do it, not by directly desiring that his heartbeat should decrease in frequency, but rather by calling up certain thoughts which have that result. He suggested that perhaps  'that power might have been greater and &lt;been&gt; destroyed by repetition' . Apparently he thought that many of us have lost the power of controlling our passions and the related motions of our bodies by calling up certain ideas.  He concluded that 'the heart itself is not clearly separated by the voluntary motions in a certain view of it' (NLM, II, fols. 273-5).\n\nThis clearly does not mean that Cullen sided with Porterfield and the Stahlians on either the manner or the extent of the mind's control over the body. He limited such control to our conscious choice, and while, apart from such choice, the motions of  the body are affected by the mind, they are not voluntary. Earlier Cullen did consider the possibility that all actions of  our internal organs may originally have been voluntary like the motions of our eyes,  and only became automatic through custom and habitj  but he  argued  that  this  is  improbable,  given  that  in  adults  an internal organ can react to new stimuli without their being in any way conscious of it or requiring any process of habituation. Moreover, the kind of control which Cullen envisioned over our internal organs is only of the  most  general  kind-not  involving  a  choice  of the  operation  of specific muscles. This is essentially what was proposed in section 45 of Descartes' Passions of the Soul:\n\nOur passions, too, cannot be directly aroused or suppressed by the action of  our will, but only indirectly through the representation of things which are usually joined with the passions we wish to have and opposed to the passions we wish to reject. For example, in order to arouse boldness and suppress fear in ourselves, it is  not sufficient to have the volition to do so. We must apply ourselves to consider the reasons, objects, or precedents which persuade us that the danger is not great. {PWD, vol.  i, p. 345)\n\nDescartes himself had recognized the importance of such control of our passions  for  health  and  disease  in  his  correspondence  with  Princess Elizabeth.®®  But  both  Cullen  and  Descartes,  because  they  limit  the\n\n'  Descartes  to  Elizabeth,  May  or  June  1645, Oeuvres  de  Descartes, vol.  4,  pp. 218-22. Theodore Brown, in 'Descartes, dualism,  and psychosomatic medicine'  (in The anatomy of madness, ed. W. F. Bynum and others, vol. i (London 1985), at p. 52), implies that Descartes cannot consistently hold that the mind can affect the passions. Brown is certainly correct that Descartes considered the passions themselves to arise directly from somatic states, but it is also consistent with the central principles of  his philosophy that Descartes gives the mind an indirect control over the passions.\n\n3 0 0\n\nmind's  operations  to  those  of which  we  are  conscious,  have  a  more limited  conception  of  the  mind's  control  over  the  body  than  did Porterfield, Perrault, and the Stahlians.*^\n\nStill, we may want to ask whether, in admitting that the mind can act independently of sensation in voluntary action (NLS  Cullen, fol. 78), Cullen was not allowing with Porterfield and Whytt that it has special active  powers not  possessed  by  inanimate  matter. Indeed,  at  the beginning of his  1772-73  lectures Cullen said that he did not want to deny  that  'the  soul  has  a  power  of  beginning  motion'  (NLM,  II, fol. 35). He later noted that 'Causes that in no part of nature have any tendency  to  excite  motion-but  rather  diminish  it  .  . .  are  frequent Causes  of it  in  animal  bodies'  (fol.  280).  (He  claimed  that  when  a depressant drug such as opium is given, sometimes the brain is excited instead of  relaxed by it.) He regarded the healing power of  nature itself  as a kind of active power in the animal economy (fol. 276-80). Neverthe­ less, there are good indications that Cullen thought that such properties resulted from a certain kind of matter,  not from a substance  entirely immaterial.®* While he was very cautious in putting forward a theory of animal  electricity,  he  admitted  that  his  important  neurophysiological concepts of 'excitement and collapse' first occurred to him when he was formulating a 'Theory' from 'an Analogy I observed in the Phaenomena of electricity'  (NLS  Cullen, fol.  185).  There is  reason to think that,  like Hume,  Cullen asked himself whether 'it is more difficult to conceive that motion may arise from impulse than that it may arise from volition?'  (E. 73).  And  like  Hume,  he  appears  to  have  answered  by speculating on the possibility of an active matter.®^\n\nIn general, we can conclude that Cullen provided a solution-within the context of a Cartesian metaphysic-to the function dualism which we foimd  so  clearly  expressed  in  Boerhaave.  Like  Boerhaave,  Cullen\n\nIt is tempting to think of Cullen's account as providing an explanation for a crude form of what  today  we  would  call  'biofeedback'.  But  for  Cullen,  like  Boerhaave,  we  never  have anything but a general sensation of  the motions of  the heart and other internal organs. Modern biofeedback phenomena appear to require continuous information about very specific changes in the condition of the body (G. Jones, Visceral learning (New York 1973)). Moreover, it is difficult to see how such phenomena could be explained on Cullen's Cartesian model of  the will, which is based on the notion of an original correlation between the willed idea and the body motions.\n\nIn stating the point in this way I have in mind Cullen's discussion in his lectures on the history of chemistry: 'Aether and Inert matter are hence supposed to be the oply matters in nature' (RCPE, MS. Cullen 10(1), fol. 87).\n\nOn Hume's comments on the aether hypothesis see my Sceptical realism of David Hume (note 30 above), pp.  145,  l6lff.; also Christie, in Conceptions of ether (note 58 above).  In his 1772-73 physiology lectures Cullen became very defensive about his claims regarding animal electricity  (NLM, III, fols.  15-19), probably in response to the attack on his student G. R. Brown's dissertation in the article on Aether in the first edition of  the Encyclopaedia Britannica. See R. K. French, 'Aether and physiology', in Conceptions of ether, at p.  118.\n\nmaintained that the basic life functions are carried out independently of the mind. He argued that in one sense the visceral organs are constantly influenced by the mind, though their activity is not voluntarily willed; this  influence  is  clearest  in  the  case  of the  passions.  But  Cullen  also argued that to a limited degree our corporeal functions can be voluntarily controlled by the mind-that is, by imagining certain objects which are naturally  and  habitually  conjoined  with  our  passions.  Thus,  while Cullen held that there is a basic dualism between mental functions on the one hand and vital and natural ones on the other, he also showed the nature  of  the  causal  relation  between  them.  This  causal  interaction cannot,  according to  Cullen,  be  described in mechanical terms,  since descriptions of  mental processes are not in practice reducible to physical ones.'® Thus, in Cullen's physiology, unlike that of Boerhaave, it was essential to discuss the conditions of  mind conducive to life and health.''\n\n## Department of Philosophy\n\nUniversity of Windsor\n\n- But such a reduction appears to be possible in principle. In his 1770 lectures, Cullen wrote against the Stahlians that 'the force of impression is every where absolute; &amp; it is according to the  force  of impression,  and other  mechanical  conditions  of the  System,  that  the  motions excited prove either salutary or pernicious' (NLS Cullen, fols.  159-60).\n- '  This paper was written in  1986-87 while I  was a visiting member of the  Institute for Advanced Study (Princeton) and received a Grant-in-Aid from the Institute.

I NTRODUCTION\n\nAt the beginning of his Institutions of medicine William Cullen defined ' P h y sio l o g y ,  or  the  Doctrine  of  the  Animal  Oeconomy'  as  'the doctrine  which  explains  the  conditions  of the  body  and  of the  mind necessary to life and health'.' Commenting on the same definition in his Edinburgh medical lectures in 1770, he noted that while physiologists normally discussed mental conditions  it was  not usual  to  include  the mind in the definition of  physiology. Some people had criticized him for introducing metaphysics into medicine. In response, Cullen employed a distinction which was also made by his friend David Hume, between two meanings  of 'metaphysics'.  It  can mean  'subtile  Disquisitions' :  like Hume, he wanted to avoid metaphysics in this sense. However, if by Metaphysics we understand as I think we should the Operations of the human Mind in thinking, that is, the History of the human Mind, then I say Metaphysics are unavoidable not only in Physick, but perhaps in every Science if a man goes deep.\n\nTrue metaphysics for both thinkers was concerned with 'the Mind and its  Operations' .  Cullen  saw  this  as  a particularly  important  study  in medicine because 'it is not less certain that the Conditions of the Mind do mutually affect the Body' than that 'the Conditions of the Body do affect the Mind'.^\n\nIn proposition 310!  the Institutions Cullen adopted the view that there\n\n## © John P.

This manuscript appears to be in Cullen's own hand. On 'metaphysics',  cf.  Hume,  E.  12-13.  For  the  friendship  between  Cullen  and  Hume,  see HL i.  163, ii. 449-50.\n\nis an immaterial mind in a living man and that all thinking is a property of this alone. However, he also insisted that this soul or mind (he used the terms  interchangeably)  is  closely  connected  with  'the  material  and corporeal part' of  man, in particular with the nervous system. While he accepted this connection as a fact, 'the mode of it we do not understand, nor pretend to explain'.  He would probably have included questions about how mind  and  body are interconnected among  the  false metaphysics which he rejected. At the end of  his 1770-71 lecture on this proposition  Cullen  mentioned  three  philosophico-theological  hypo­ theses  about  the  nature  of  this  connection-the  ancient  theory  of 'Physical  Influx',  the  doctrine  of  'occasional  Causes'  which  he ascribed to Descartes, and the 'pre-established Harmonies' theory of Leibniz.  However, he said no more about these except that there are 'Difficulties' with each (NLS Cullen, fols. 78-9). In his flnal course of lectures he stressed that none of these systems 'have the least effect or inffuence  in  explaining  anything.  They  do  not  either  admit  of  any application in Physic, or in any part of science that I see.' The adoption of one or the other only affects 'the business of religion'.^\n\nCullen had a very different attitude to the questions concerning the relation of mind and body raised by eighteenth-century physiologists, and  discussed  these  at  length  in  his  lectures.  They  concerned  the 'degree and extent' of  the mutual inffuence of soul and body, no matter what the soul may be. He noted that his predecessor Robert Whytt had 'with great strength of  argument shown that the Phenomena even of  the body itself, cannot be explained, but upon the supposition of a Soul as . . .   a sensible principle' (NLM, II, fols. 25-7). Whytt had maintained that all life functions require a soul or mind. In An essay on the vital and other  involuntary  motions  of animals he  had  formulated  the  issues  of physiological metaphysics of his day rather succinctly. He could not conceive the reason why Physicians have laboured so long in accounting for the action  of the heart  and  other  vital  motions  of animals,  from  the  powers  and properties of body independent of the mind:  if it be not, that in some, the leaven of  Cartesianism  still  continues  to  work;  in  others  a  too  great  fondness  for mechanical reasoning in Physiological matters; and in both, a contempt of the extravagant flights  of Stahl and  his  followers,  with  regard  to  the  manner  in which the mind regulates all the actions of the body.'*\n\nWhytt was opposed to the Cartesian principles that the vital functions take place independently of the mind, that the essence of the mind is to\n\n- ^   'The institutes of medicine by Dr Cullen Oct.  28,  1772'   (5  vols.):  National  Library of Medicine, Bethesda, Md., MS.

But he was  also opposed to the main alternative-^the so-called Stahlian theory, which maintained that the mind controls the body by acting as a 'rational' principle (Essay, p. 289). Both the Cartesian view and the Stahlian theory were espoused by Whytt's Scottish contemporaries.\n\nIn  this  paper  I  shall  explain  the  issues  concerning  the  mutual interaction of  mind and body which were debated by eighteenth-century Scottish physiologists.  Their debates must be understood against the background  of  a  dualism  between  mental  and  vital functions. This dualism, which we may caW   function dualism, had been clearly set out in Cartesian  writings  such  as  the Description  of the  human  body, where Descartes rejected the view that the soul or mind is responsible for life processes, and where he limited its functions to those accompanied by self-conscious  thought.^  Such  a  position  was  adopted  by  Hermann Boerhaave,  whose  thought  played  an  important  role  in  eighteenthcentury  Scottish  physiology.  The  essential  problems  posed  by  the writers we shall look at concern the extent to which the vital processes affect the mind, and the extent to which and manner whereby mental processes,  however  they  arise,  affect  those  vital  processes.  These problems,  though  independent,  are  closely  related  to  the  question whether the vital processes can be explained mechanically. But I shall argue that physiologists such as Whytt and Porterfield, who maintained that the life functions require mind or soul, went beyond a bare rejection of  mechanism.  They  conceived  of  mind  and  its  basic  functions  of sensation and volition in very different ways from those who subscribed to  the  basic  principles  of  Cartesian  metaphysics,  as  well  as  in  very different ways from one another.\n\nIt may be cause for surprise that major issues in what we should now call philosophy of mind were discussed by medical writers of whom few present-day philosophers have heard. However, I hope to show that our lack of acquaintance may not indicate any  lack of profundity  in their thought  or  in  the  problems  they  debated. Traditional  history  of philosophy in addressing the philosophy of mind has perhaps concen­ trated too narrowly on theological issues which arise from a substance dualism. This dualism was also given a seventeenth-century philosophi­ cal formulation by Descartes, in his conceptual distinction between two different natures,  a thinking and an extended one.  But it needs  to  be\n\n- ' The philosophical writings of Descartes (hereafter trans.  J.  G.  Cottingham  and others, vol.  i   (Cambridge  1985), pp. 314-15. Cf. Passions of the soul, arts. 4-5 {PWD, yol.  I, p. 329). On the Cartesian programme in physiology see T. S. Hall, History ofgeneral  physiology, vol.  I  (Chicago  1975), esp. pp. 256-7, and his translation of Rene Descartes, Treatise of man (Cambridge, Mass.  1972).\n\ncarefully distinguished from what I have called/wncrion dualism. Many who  adopted  substance  dualism  (Boerhaave  and  Haller  are  obvious examples)  hold  that  there  is  a  one-to-one  correspondence  between mental events and  brain events, however  it is to be  explained. Nevertheless, the central issues of mid-eighteenth-century philosophy of  mind lie elsewhere-in the problems raised by function dualism. Both a more accurate history, and (in so far as our present-day concepts have their roots in that history) a more fruitful philosophy, will result from taking such problems seriously.\n\nBy the  time  Cullen  was  giving  his  lectures  in  the  early  1770s,  the Edinburgh Medical School was among the most renowned in Europe. He himself had been a student in its early years in the mid to late 1730s. In his clinical lectures of 1785-86 he commented that during his studies he had 'learned the system of Boerhaave' and was taught to think that that medical system was 'very perfect, complete and sufficient'. When he had returned to Edinburgh some twenty years later he 'still found the system of Boerhaave prevailing as much as ever'.®  Cullen claimed to reject important parts of Boerhaave's system-for example, the view of the body as a hydraulic machine.' He stressed the centrality of  the central nervous system in the production of life processes,* and tended to think of it as  operating on principles analogous  to those of static electricity {Institutions, props. 125,130). However, in section V of  this paper I shall argue that Cullen adopted a Cartesian conception of mind which was closer  to  that  of  Boerhaave  than  to  that  of  his  own  immediate predecessors.  It  is  Cullen's  analyses  of 'sensation'  and  'volition' which provided his  solution to the problem of mind-body interaction posed by them.\n\nAlthough there are good grounds to question Cullen's retrospective claim about the monolithic teaching of physiology among his predeces­ sors, there is no doubt that Boerhaave's doctrines were very important in the Edinburgh curriculum until about 1760. For this reason I begin in the next section with a study of the  central principles  of Boerhaave's physiological  system. In  section  III,  I  examine  the  metaphysical physiology  of  William  Porterfield  and  its  seventeenth-century  antiCartesian origins. The fourth section is devoted to the ideas of Robert\n\n- '  John Thomson, An account of the life, lectures, and writings of William Cullen, M.D., vol.  I (Edinburgh 1859), pp.  118-19.\n\n^   NLM, II, fol.  I.  Cullen purported to adopt the  system of Friedrich Hoffmann, whose Pundamenta medicinae was  published in  1695.  But  Cullen exaggerated the extent  to which Boerhaave disregarded the nervous system. Indeed, Haller took issue with Boerhaave because he attributed too much influence to the nervous power (sect.  IV below).\n\n*   In commenting on proposition 97 of his Institutions in  1772, Cullen spoke of the animal power seated in the brain as 'the fundamental part of the System without which the Functions cannot long remain'. This power was either 'a Sentient principle or a Mechanical Energy' (NLM, II, fols.  195-6).\n\nWhytt,  the  undoubted  genius  of eighteenth-century  Scottish  physi­ ology, whose metaphysical ideas are rooted in a very different medical and philosophical tradition from that of  Boerhaave. In the final section I examine the synthesis of earlier ideas which was effected by Cullen.\n\n## I I .   BOERHAAVIAN  PHYSIOLOGY  AT  EDINBURGH\n\nWhile  there  had  been  earlier  attempts  to  found  a  medical  school  in Edinburgh,  it  has  been  traditional  to  date  its  beginning  from  the appointment  of  four  new  professors  in  1726.  Porterfield  had  been appointed to the first chair in the Institutes and Practice of Medicine in 1724;  but  while  he  continued  to  be  an  active  member  of the  Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, and the Edinburgh Society for the Improvement of Medical Knowledge, there is no evidence that he ever lectured  or  played  any  further  role  in  the  Medical  School.  Another earlier  appointment  was  that  of Alexander  Monro (primus) who,  as professor of  Anatomy, played a fundamental role in the foundation of  the faculty.®  All  of these  men,  including  Porterfield,  had matriculated  in medicine  at  the  University  of  Leiden  between  1718  and  1720,  and probably attended the  lectures  of Boerhaave  while  they were there.'® Boerhaave's  texts  were  certainly  assigned  in  Edinburgh  in  the  early 1740s. An advertisement for medical lectures in 1741 announced that Dr Andrew St Clair, professor of the Theory of Physic, would teach 'by explaining the Injtitutiones medicae composed by Dr Herman Boerhaave'.\"  St  Clair  had  been  one  of the  first  professors,  so  it  is possible that Cullen had attended earlier lectures by him, as well as those of the other teachers in the new School.\n\nThe topics which interest us are outlined in various propositions of Boerhaave's Institutiones  medicae. This  work underwent a number of editions, beginning in 1708. The numbered propositions often served as little  more  than  a  succinct  statement  of  the  doctrines  developed  in Boerhaave's actual lectures. A student's transcription of St Clair's Latin lectures on this work has been preserved and I  shall refer to this after examining Boerhaave's own doctrines. These were readily available to students after 1739 with Haller's publication of  Boerhaave's lectures.\" A somewhat free English translation appeared a few years later under the\n\n- '  A.

Hereafter, ' Praelectiones': I  shall refer to this by volume and page number.\n\ntitle Dr. Boerhaave's academical lectures on the theory of  physic,^^ in the following account I  shall generally quote from this, supplementing or replacing it where necessary.\n\nBoerhaave's commitment to mechanism in medicine was armounced in his Oratio de usu ratiocinii mechanici in medicinaf* delivered in Leiden in  1703,  in  the  third  year  after  his  appointment  to  a  lectureship  in medicine. He compared the human body to a clock which anyone can see to be faulty, but which can only be corrected by the expert who 'from his knowledge of the correct structure, discerns the defects of the parts and the  ways  and  means  of  repairing  them' (Orations, p.  i n ) .   To  the objection  that  'life,  diseases  and  health  derive  from  non-mechanical principles', since the mind has power over the body, Boerhaave replied that 'as soon as the capacity of  thinking influences our body, every effect it brings about therein is wholly corporeal, and so subject to mechanical laws'. Even if the prime cause were incorporeal, still the physician need only concern himself with corporeal conditions in medicine (p.  114).'^\n\nThe  clock  image  appeared  again  in  Boerhaave's  discussion  of the natural sources of  medical knowledge at the beginning of  the Academical lectures. He noted that the human body can act as an automaton, and gave a watch as the example of the latter. An automaton is a 'Machine that performs various Motions without any other Cause than the Mechanism of  its own Parts within itself^ which, when once put in Motion, continues so, from the same Cause'. The analogy is used to support a view of the animal body as a machine which can operate completely independently, without any cause but the necessary motion of  its own inner mechanism. The mainspring in the body is the heart, 'which continues its alternate Contractions  and  Dilations  so  long  as  the  Animal  lives' .  Boerhaave noted  that  such  motions  are  independent  of the  mind:  they  can  be neither produced nor destroyed 'by the influence of the Mind or Will' (Lectures, 4.1).\n\nThe examples of automatic motions which he went on to give indicate that  he  had  in  mind  a  far  more  complex  machine  than  a  clock.  In proposition 4 he was primarily concerned with the automatic responses of the body for preserving health and warding off disease.  He gave a number of examples of automatic defence mechanisms of the bodywhich he identified with the Hippocratic healing power of Nature.\n\n- Dr.  Boerhaave's academical lectures on the theory of physic, being . . .   a translation of his Institutes and  explanatory  comment, 5 vols.

The mind is not able  to  suppress  these  automatic  Endeavours  of  our  Machines  for  Selfpreservation. Suppose one Friend tells another that he is only going to threaten him with a Blow upon the Eye, and therefore bids him endeavour not to shut it at the Offer: The Mind is at that Time secure from Danger; but the specious Offer is no sooner made than the Lids of that tender Organ are closed; notwithstand­ ing all the Reasons and Reluctancy of the Mind to the contrary. {Lectures, 4.1)\n\nThis example had been employed by Descartes in his Passions of the soul (sec.  13).  It  appears  that  for  both  thinkers  the  action  of the  mind  is identified with our  conscious  effort to keep  our eyes open; the action which occurs in spite of  our conscious effort is ascribed to the mechanism of the body. Boerhaave stressed that the automatic defence motions of the  body  are  made  without  any  consciousness  of the  mind {sine  ulla mentis conscientia fiunt: Praelectiones, I, p.  5).\n\nThe  purely  automatic  and  unconscious action  of  the  body  of proposition 4 of the Institutes is contrasted in proposition 5 with those actions which arise from an 'uneasy Sensation' (molesta  perceptio) in the mind. Boerhaave stressed that this  latter is  a principle  'quite distinct from  that  of the  automatic  Motions  of the  Body',  and  that  'these Endeavours' to remove a painful sensation 'belong to the Mind'. But he carefully distinguished these 'Endeavours of  the Mind for Ease' into two kinds-those which are quite spontaneous, and those which arise from reason and observation. In the first category he places actions such as the rubbing of  one's eye to get rid of  an itc h i^ o r the attempt to relieve  &gt; a  muscular pain  by trying  out  different  positions  of one's  body.  The second involves a rational observation which determines which of these spontaneous  remedies  really  work.  This  is  regarded  as  an  important source of the art of medicine {Lectures, 5.1).\n\nThe Cartesian doctrine of soul or mind as essentially conscious-like that  of  the  automatism  in  a  living  body-is  central  to  Boerhaave's Academical lectures. In proposition 27 of his Institutes he asserted that 'Man is composed of a Body and Mind, united to each other'. He also noted  that  mind  and  body  have  distinct  natures.  In  his  lecture  he explained that 'the essential Nature of the Mind is to be conscious, or to think'.'®   For Boerhaave, no less than Descartes, this disjunction does\n\n'Mentis est, esse conscium sive cogitare' {Praelectiones, I, p. 41). Boerhaave was awarded a doctorate in philosophy for a thesis De distinctione mentis a corpore (Leiden 1690). He argued\n\nnot indicate a mere tautology. Thought is inherently reflexive: we are not merely aware, but are aware of ourselves as being aware.\n\nBoerhaave wrote that volition (voluntas) 'is the action of the mind' (Lectures 27.6;  cf.  Descartes, Passions, secs.  13,  17).  We  have  already seen  that  conscious effort  played  a  fundamental  role  for  him  in distinguishing the action of the mind from the automatic motions of the body  machine. He  included  volition, along  with  perception  and judgement, as one of  the three functions of  the mind which constitute its 'life',  and  noted  that  the  life  of  the  mind  is  nothing  but  'to  be conscious'. Later, he describes a voluntary movement (motus voluntarius) as one which results from a definition or determination of the mind (a  mente  definiente). He  illustrates  this  by  a  situation  where  he  has decided to move a limb when the hands of  a clock reach a certain position ten minutes hence^ this is  'certainly a Foresight of something not yet existing: The inclination comes to me (accedit voluntas), I will (volo), and I define the time' . Voluntary action, at least in this case, clearly arises from a conscious effort of  the will (Lectures, 695.13 ^ Praelectiones, VI, pp.  1,6-7). But while everyone is acquainted with volition, it is what 'no one can explain' (Lectures, 27.6).\n\nWhile  Boerhaave  conceived  of  the  conscious  will  as  a  source  of motions in the human body, he also thought that the will itself arises from mechanical actions in that body, in particular those arising from changes  in  the  nervous  system.  He  describes  the  way  that  external objects, after causing motions in the nerves, transfer those motions to the common sensory in the brain. There they form an idea of the object:\n\ngenerally this Idea or Representation of the Object excites something more than the  bare  Representation,  which  is  not  a  simple  Idea  or  Perception,  but  a Determination of the Will with respect to the Idea. (Lectures, 572.1)\n\nIt is in the 'sensorium' in the brain where all the nerves terminate that the impressions of external objects 'determine the will either to love or hatred' (574.2). Even when we recall a certain idea in obedience to the will, this results from 'nothing more than a mechanical Disposition or Change' in the common sensory (581; cf. 580 for the context). The only that the mind 'excludes the body' on the ground that mind is 'conscious to itself of its own thought' and that as such it turns back on itself  without being divided; this is impossible in an extended thing (chap. 3). He appealed here to the authority of  Gerard de Vries, who had argued against Dutch Cartesians that belief in innate ideas is irreconcilable with the principle that all thought must be conscious (G.  Lewis, Le Probleme de I'inconscient et le Cartesianisme (Paris 1950)) PP-  140-41,170)- Boerhaave was closely connected with the Cartesian de Voider (G. A. Lindeboom, Hermann Boerhaave, the man and his work (London 1968), p. 24), who held that the mind apprehends itself  directly in being conscious (Lewis, pp.  117-18). On Descartes'  own view see R. McRae, 'Descartes' definition of thought', in Cartesian studies, ed.  R.  J.  Butler (Oxford 1972), 55-70; Lewis, pp. 37-103.\n\nhint of an exception to the complete mechanical determination of our perceptions, judgements, and volitions came when Boerhaave suggested that the thinking of  a person engrossed in abstract thought, who becomes totally impervious to the state of his body, gives us some evidence that the mind 'may live hereafter without any Commerce with its Body' (27.4).  But  in  general,  as  Cullen  later  told  his  students,  the  stress throughout Boerhaave's  discussion was  on the  dependence of mental processes, including volition, upon the mechanical changes in the body. Boerhaave  insisted  that  there  is  'such  a  reciprocal  Connection  and Consent between the particular Thoughts and Affections of the Mind and the Body, that a Change in one always produces a Change in the other, and the reverse' (27(4)). In fact, at least from the point of view of medicine, he thought that mechanical changes in the nervous system had priority over changes in the mind. He insisted that the physician did not need to concern himself  with the condition of  mind of  his patient, even in mental  disorders,  since  if the  body  'is  set  to  rights'  the  mind  'will quickly return to its Office' (27.8).\n\nGiven his apparent mechanical determinism, we may well ask about the significance of dualism in Boerhaave's lectures, for, as we have seen, he asserted unequivocally that mind and body are of  different natures. In fact, he stressed the difference between sensations on the one hand, and the  mechanical  changes  in  the  brain  and  the  object  which  cause  the sensation on the other:\n\nThe  Idea of Pain which we  perceive,  neither  expresses  the  Burning  nor  the Dissolution of  the N  erve; for there is only one Intelligence given to the Mind of  a present Evil, agreeable to the good Will of the Creator.  Sensation therefore is nothing either in the Object, or the Nerve affected; but a certain Idea which God had determined or assigned to each particular Change in the corporeal Sensory. (5 7 0 -7 )\n\nIt is  the fact that these processes are of such a different nature which requires that they be connected by a law established by the Deity. Like Cullen later, Boerhaave briefly outlined the three philosophical theories of the connection of mind and body; but unlike Cullen he opted for one of them, namely the Leibnizian.  It is likely, he told his  students, that there is 'a Harmony establish'd by God, taking it for an infallible Rule, that determinate actions of the Mind must be necessarily attended with corresponding Motions in the Body, and the contrary'.  But he added that the occasionalist theory was also possible.\n\nHowever, there is a more important dualism implicit in Boerhaave's lectures which is quite different from his distinction between immediate objects  of awareness  and the related mechanical changes in the body. This is a dualism between those (brain) processes on which our mental\n\n2 6 o functions depend and those processes on which life itself  depends. At the beginning  of his  section  on  pathology  Boerhaave  made  a  distinction between  'animal'  or mind-related  functions  of the  body  on  the  one hand, and 'vital' and 'natural' ones on the other. An animal function is defined  as  one  which has  the power of directly  changing thoughts  or ideas in the mind or being directly changed by the mind. A vital function is one on which life immediately depends: the beating of the heart is the standard example. The natural functions, like digestion and excretion, are required to maintain the body in a continuous state of health. The animal functions have no direct effect on the vital and natural ones, nor do these directly affect the animal ones:\n\nThe vital Actions do not change the Thoughts or Ideas of the Mind; nor, on the other Hand, are those Actions dependent on, or determined by, the Mind: For the Heart continues to act, whether I am sleeping or waking. Nor are the Ideas of the  Mind  changed  from  the  Exercise  of the  natural  Faculties  by  which  the Aliments are formed into Chyle.  .  .  . (695.11)\n\nThus we have no sensation of the operation of the muscles involved in our vital and digestive processes,and these neither directly affect, nor can be affected by, the thoughts of the mind.\n\nThis dualism of functions depends on the independence of the organs on  which  the  functions  depend.  In  his  discussion  of the  'Action  of Muscles' he noted that when the brain is damaged 'in such a Manner as to  let  the  Injury  extend  to  the  Medulla'  then  'the  actions  of all  the voluntary  Muscles  cease  instantly,  together  with  all  the  Senses  and Memory'. In spite of this, the 'spontaneous Motions of  the involuntary Muscles'  continue  in  all  the  'vital  Parts'.  However,  these  too  are destroyed along with the animal functions, when the cerebellum alone is destroyed. Boerhaave stressed that the nerves to the heart arise only from the  cerebellum,  not  from  the higher  brain  (401(2-3),  401.7).  He  also distinguished  the  voluntary muscles  from  the  involuntary  ones,  even those  involved  in  respiration.'*  Indeed,  in  his  discussion  of  sleep, Boerhaave went so far as to speak of two distinct machines in the bodies of men and animals. One of these 'is dead' through much of our lives (that is, whenever we are in a dreamless sleep), while the other continues to function throughout. He stressed the independent operation of these machines, though he also clearly acknowledged the dependence of the former on the latter (590.1).\n\nBoerhaave  did  hold {Lectures, 301.6)  that  when  the  heart  and  other  visceral  muscles become inflamed we feel pain.  However, he denied that distinct muscles of the heart were sensible.\n\nBoerhaave distinguished the vital from the voluntary causes of  respiration and maintained that the former can override the latter.  Two  distinct sets of muscles are controlled by two different parts of the brain (Lectures, 6oiff.).\n\nBoerhaave's  separation  of  animal  and  vital  functions  is closely connected with his rejection of the notion of a life soul. In his discussion of pathology he  identified the  soul or psyche as  that part  of us  which thinks (Praelectiones, VI, p. 5)- He opposed those who have taken into account an 'animating Principle' in medicine. In particular, there is no evidence for the existence of an 'Archeus' or  'cogitative Principle' . Thus he sets himself clearly against the  immaterial physiological and pathological principles of two earlier medical writers, Jean-Baptiste van Helmont and Georg Stahl {Lectures, 697, 697.2).\n\nBut at least one phenomenon lay, as it were, in the gap between the two functions which Boerhaave tried to hold separate. We have seen that, for Boerhaave, an essential feature of  animal functions is that they take place with consciousness. This was clearly true of  voluntary actions, which he located in the brain itself and in certain muscles.  But in his Institutes, when dealing with muscular action, Boerhaave had written that 'while the Will remains undetermined' there is no movement of nervous fluid toward the voluntary muscles,  and thus they remain at rest {Lectures, 40(14); Praelectiones, III, p.  202). He noted that in sleep 'none of the voluntary muscles will . . .  be brought into action' {Lectures, 401.23). However,  he  also  felt  compelled  to  note  an  anomalous  phenomenon which does not easily fit his account. Some actions which originally had their  source  in  the  will  come  to  be  performed  by  custom  without consciousness. We often walk without thinking about what we are doing; and after we wake up in the morning, we sit up and in doing so place our limbs in that position 'to which they have been accustomed through the whole Course of Life, without giving them any sensible Command of the Will'. The English translation has Boerhaave claiming that in such cases we operate  'from  Custom by  the  Influence  of the  Mind, of which  by continued Use we are insensible' (401.24, italics mine); but Boerhaave himself  did not say that the mind acts insensibly.The translation clearly conflicts  with  what  he  says  elsewhere.  Nevertheless,  Boerhaave  does seem to  have  a  problem,  given  his  insistence  that  voluntary  muscles operate only under the influence of the will. If the mind must operate in order to effect the motion of voluntary muscles, why not say that in the problematic  cases  it  acts  unconsciously?  This  is  what  certain  of Boerhaave's Scottish critics were quite prepared to say.\n\nI  have  called  Boerhaave's  distinction  between  mental  and  vital functions 'Cartesian' . He rejects any vital soul and identifies soul with that  part  of us  which is  conscious.  This  is  clearly  in accord  with  the conceptual revolution which Descartes proposed at the beginning of his\n\notnnino in corpore musculi voluntarii,  gui ex sola consuetudine, injussi &amp; nobis non consciis  operantur\", i.e.  the  voluntary  muscles  'operate  solely  from  habit,  unbidden,  and without our consciousness of it' {Praelectiones, III, p. 218).\n\nDescription  of the  human  body and  elsewhere.  Boerhaave  went  on,  in accord with the physiological programme which Descartes laid out, to describe bodily processes such as the motion of the heart, as resulting from the mechanism of the parts and as being entirely automatic. Yet it would be wrong simply to call Boerhaave a Cartesian, for his conception of  the  mind  and  body  differ  in  certain  key  respects  from  that  of Descartes. The difference between their theories of mind is not relevant to  our  present  concerns,^®  but  it  is  important  for  our  subsequent discussion  to  consider  briefly  Boerhaave's  general  conception  of the body and how it differs from the Cartesian one.\n\nLike Descartes, Boerhaave held that the basic principles operating in the  human  body  were  the  same  as  those  operative  throughout  the universe.  But  Descartes  had  held  that  body  could  be  completely characterized  by  the  attribute  of extension,  and  its  processes  by  the mechanical  transfer  of motion  from  part  to  part.  In  his  lecture  on Institutes prop.  27,  Boerhaave  adopted the  conception of body-then accepted by Locke and Newton, as well as Leibniz-as that which is impenetrable, as  well  as extended. Moreover,  while  he  held  that  the 'action' of a body consists in the transfer of  motion to another body, he also  spoke of all bodies as having a 'life'. Among those things which constitute the life of bodies he included the force of attraction between the constituent parts. It is commonly said that Boerhaave thought of  the body merely as a hydraulic machine; but it is more accurate to say he conceived of the body machine as involving an interaction between the solid elastic vessels and the fluids which were forced through them. The force  of elasticity  played  an  important  role  in  his  conception  of the generation of  motion in the living body. Boerhaave described the body as 'an Assemblage of small elastic Solids, by whose conjoined and regular Actions, Life and Health are produced'.  Later he identified elasticity with a 'Resistance or Re-action common to all Bodies' (695.2).  This force of  elasticity is a 'universal Principle of  Nature', and like the power of gravitation by which planets are attracted towards each other it is not innate in matter itself.  It is  'to be ascribed only to the Creator of the Universe, who has determined this as a Principle uniting the Parts of Bodies'. Boerhaave was clearly drawing on a set of concepts which were richer than those allowed by Cartesian physics.\n\nBoerhaave  defined  'mechanics'  very  broadly  as  the  study  which teaches one 'to apply the general Laws of  Motion to all kinds of  Bodies' (29.3). The fact that he was willing to allow principles such as elasticity and attraction did not for him constitute any limitation to mechanism.\n\n'   Against Descartes, Boerhaave held that there is no more to mind itself than the thought of the present moment {Lectures, 581.1); he also rejected Descartes'   view that judgement is a function of will (586.14).\n\nHowever, other writers more firmly planted in the Newtonian tradition were concerned to show that the existence of such 'active' principles did indicate the limits of mechanism in nature itself.\"\"\n\nBy Boerhaave's time most writers on the animal economy expressed reservations  about the universal application of mechanical principles. However, it is important to consider carefully the exact nature of the limitations which any given author imposed. Boerhaave commented that 'they  who  think  that  all  physical  Appearances  are  to  be  explained mechanically,  are  in  my  Opinion  misled'  (ip.?)-  When  examined  in context, this will be seen to be a comment on the limits of  our knowledge, not a remark to indicate that other principles operate in things besides mechanical  ones.  In his  lecture on proposition 40  Boerhaave told his students that 'there are many, and considerable Motions performed in Nature, of whose Causes we are ignorant; but the Motions themselves are  always  subject  to  those  universal  Laws  which  appear  true  in  all sensible  Bodies'  (40.20).  He  was  particularly  critical  of attempts  to apply geometrical principles taken from 'Bodies of particular Disposi­ tions' to the explanation of complex organic processes (19.7)-\n\nIt  is,  however,  misleading  to  take  Boerhaave's declarations of epistemological  scepticism  too  seriously.  He  did  not  hesitate  to  put forward mechanical hypotheses to support his own mechanical view of the operations of  the human body. Throughout his lectures he described how the elastic solids which constitute the 'vessels' of the body react to the 'dilatation' or expansion caused by the fiuids which flow into them. This interaction was employed in his explanation of the operation of the heart.  Boerhaave  thought  that  all  muscular  motion  results  from  the motion of a 'nervous liquor' or 'spirit' which flows from the brain via the nerves, so that it 'dilates, fills and alters the Membranes of  the Fibres [of the muscles], as to reduce them from an oblong to a rounder Figure, increasing their smaller Diameter, and diminishing their larger, so as to bring Tendons nearer to each other' (402(7)). Boerhaave thought that there is a constant pressure of  nervous fluid in all the muscles of  the body keeping  them in  a  constant  state  of contraction.  However,  when  the muscle of the heart contracts, the flow of blood into the auricles makes them expand and cut off  the flow of  fluid from the cardiac nerves 'which pass into the Heart by the  Side of the Aorta and pulmonary Artery'. This makes the muscles of the ventricles 'paralytic', allowing them to relax and fill up with blood from the auricles. This releases the pressure on the cardiac nerves and allows nervous fluid to flow into the muscles of the ventricles again, causing them to contract and start the process again. The whole system operates in a purely automatic way, depending only\n\n- J.  P.  Wright,  'Matter,  mind  and  active  principles  in  mid  eighteenth-century  British physiology', Man and nature 4 (Edmonton 1985)3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n264\n\non  a  continuous  pressure  of nervous  fluid  through  the  nerves  and  a constant supply of blood from the vena cava and pulmonary veins (409). We shall see that Robert Whytt presented convincing arguments to show that this mechanism of the operation of the heart muscles will not work.\n\nIt  is  difficult  to  draw  firm  conclusions  about the  teaching  of these doctrines in Edinburgh. It would, of course, be wrong to conclude that just  because  Boerhaave's Institutes was  used  as  a  text  his  views  were always taught uncritically. Nevertheless there is some reason to think, both from the statements of Cullen and from the rough set of student notes surviving from St Clair's lectures in 1740,^^ that some version of these  doctrines  was  presented  in  the  1730s  and  early  1740s.  Like Boerhaave,  St  Clair held that the only  explanatory principles  for lifephenomena are mechanical ones; however, he showed, if anything, more scepticism about our ability to fathom what these are. Part of  the note on proposition 4 reads:\n\nThe greatest mistake is of those who wish nothing to be considered in medicine except what can be explained mechanically. Nothing indeed should be explained except  mechanically,  but  many  things  may  be  considered  for  which  no mechanical explanation can be given and for which we can give no a priori cause. (St Clair, I, pp.  15-16)\n\nThis scepticism appears to continue in the lecture on proposition 27, where, instead of giving the essence of body and mind as Boerhaave had done,  the  view  is  expressed  that  'the  cleverest .philosopher  does not know the intimate nature of  anything' (p. 79). Nevertheless, though in a rather  confused  way,  Boerhaave's  central- teaching  on  these  topics emerges in the course of the lecture.\n\nWhat  appears  to  be  a  more  substantial  difference  occurs  at  the beginning of the lecture on proposition 27. At first sight St Clair appears totally  opposed to  Boerhaave's  own  central  doctrine  on  the  indepen­ dence of cognitive and vital functions. The manuscript reads: 'Mind is part of  man himself. If  the soul is destroyed, this makes the body lifeless and rigid' (p. 79). It would seem that life processes are being ascribed to some sort of vital soul!  However, what follows is a Boerhaavian account which clearly separates the mind from any vital functions:\n\nLet me first overturn the objections of those who argue that the human body without the prop of  mind is lifeless and useless..  .  . Let such a philosopher order if he can his own heart to move slower or faster.  Can he determine the blood through his own body by the power of  mind.  .  .  ?  From these and many others it is  clear that most activities obey the power of mind not at all.  (p. 80)\n\n## Like Boerhaave, St Clair claimed that 'to think is to be conscious' and\n\n'Praelectiones in Institutiones Boerhavii a Andreo St. Claire M.D.', 3 vols. (1740): RCPE, MS. M9.35-7.\n\n266\n\nPorterfield's comments on the operations of the mind in the body first appeared towards the end of  the initial part of  the article, in the course of his discussion of the cause of the fact that our two eyes-unlike those of chameleons and other animals-operate together ('Motions of our eyes', I,  pp.  i63ff.).  He  began  with  an  account  of what he  called  'the final Cause of this uniform Motion', or, in other words, the ways in which it is advantageous to us. The first advantage is that it results in a stronger, more lively, and perfect image of the object (p.  184). He also argued that uniform motion is not necessary  to  see  a  single  object with  two  eyes (pp.  192-252).^^ He rejected Berkeley's theory of vision (which relies on an experienced correlation of sight with touch), arguing that we have a kind of immediate knowledge of externality through sight (pp. 229ff.). Nevertheless, his own account of vision is not purely innatist and, like that of Berkeley, takes account of the role of experience.\n\nThe most important advantage of the imiform motion of our eyes, according to Porterfield, is in enabling us 'to judge with more Certainty of the Distance of Objects'  (p.  187).  The most common and reliable method of judging distance is by our knowledge of  the angle made by the axis of each of our eyes when they focus together on an object in front of us: the smaller the angle made at the convergence of the lines from each eye at the object, the more distant the object. The judgement is made on the basis of  our feeling or sensation of  the motion of  each eye as it focuses inward on the object (p.  189). His account here closely follows that of Malebranche.^® Like Malebranche, he held that this sensation incorpor­ ates a kind of  natural judgement of  distance.^® This depends on an innate principle that 'Every Point of an Object appears and is seen without the Eye nearly in a straight Line, drawn perpendicularly to the Retina, from that Point of  it where its Image falls' (p. 208). Porterfield seems to think that it is by employing this principle that we are naturally able to judge the,distance of  objects by the uniform motions of  our eyes. Malebranche had  called  such  judgements  'natural'  because  they  are  formed  'in ourselves, independently of ourselves, and even in spite of ourselves' .^ ® He ascribed such judgements to God, who makes them just as we would do if we knew all the laws of optics and geometry as well as everything\n\n- He argued that this is effected in cross-eyed people in spite of  the fact that their two eyes do not focus together. Porterfield correctly opposes Claude Perrault on this.\n- Nicolas Malebranche, The search  after  truth, trans.  T.  M.  Lennon and P.  J.  Olscarap (Columbus 1980), pp. 737-8.\n- 'The Judgment we form of the Situation and Distance of visual Objects, depends not on Custom and Experience, but on an original connate and immutable Law, to which our Minds have been subjected from the Time they were first united to our Bodies.' (p. 214)\n- Malebranche, De la Recherche de la verite, ed.  G.  Rodis-Lewis, in Oeuvres completes de Malebranche, vol. i (Paris 1958),  p.  119;  cf.  p. 99.  My  translation.  For  an  account  of Malebranche's  theory  of  vision  see  j'.  P.  Wright, The  sceptical  realism  of  David  Hume (Manchester 1983), pp. 66-7, 225.\n\nthat was  happening  in  our  eyes  and  brains.  Porterfield,  on  the  other hand,  does  not  claim  that the natural  judgement  takes  place  entirely independently of our will. What I have called his innate principle is not in itself  sufficient to allow us to judge the distance of  objects. Indeed our judgement of distance by means of the innate principle depends on a voluntary and rational decision to use our eyes together.\n\nThis becomes clear when Porterfield turns to 'the efficient Cause' of the uniform motion of our eyes at the end of the first part of the essay (PP- 253ff.).  'By what Necessity', he asks, does it happen that  'both Eyes  are  always  turned  the  same  way,  so  that none of us  are  able  at pleasure  to  give  them  different  Directions?'  He  rejects  the  ancient theory which attempted to account for this by the union of the two optic nerves,  pointing  out  that  these  nerves  have  no  connection  with  the muscles of  the eye which are responsible for this motion. The true cause turns out to be nothing but 'Custom and Habit', which operate imder the  direction  of the  mind.  Whatever  necessity  there  is  in  the  action results  from  the  mind  itself.  For  'it  is  not  to  be  doubted  but  these Motions are voluntary, and depending upon our Mind, which being a wise Agent, wills them to move uniformly' (p. 255).\n\nThere are really two closely related features of this action which lead Porterfield to ascribe it to the mind-that it is learned and that it is useful to us. Like chameleons, human infants 'for some Time after Birth, can look different Ways with their Eyes'. Moreover, they continue to do so until 'discovering the Advantage of directing them the same way, they come to move them always uniformly' (p. 259). Here experience plays a role:  infants  make  a voluntary  decision to  employ their eyes  together after discovering that this results in the ability to determine the distance of objects.  In this  also,  we  see  the  importance  of Porterfield's  earlier discussion of  the 'final cause' of  the uniform motion of  our two eyes, he clearly regarded the action of moving both together as  an intentional action adopted for its utility. The infant acts both freely and with some kind of  foresight, based on the experienced result of  employing both eyes together.\n\nIt is due to the repetition of this action that, after a time, most human beings and other animals cannot move their eyes independently: 'This uniform Motion by Use and Habit at last becomes so necessary, that the Eyes cannot be moved differently' (p. 259). That there is no 'intrinsical Necessity' in this is clear from cross-eyed children who move their eyes separately. The necessity experienced by most of us arises from the fact that  'the Mind has  imposed upon  itself that  Law founded  upon the Utility and Advantage that arises from this sort of  Motion' (pp. 255-6). Later, in A treatise on the eye, Porterfield will refer to this as a 'moral necessity' {Treatise, vol.  2, p.  154).\n\n268\n\nIn  the  second  part  of the  original  essay  Porterfield  extended  this analysis to motions of the body which most would consider to be quite involuntary.  Indeed  he  includes  among  them  one  which,  as  we have seen, Boerhaave and Descartes considered to be directly contrary to the action of the mind.\n\nIf a Body be hastily moved towards our Eyes, they will shut without our being conscious thereof; neither is it in our Power to do otherwise, because we have accustomed ourselves to do so on the like Occasions; for such is the Power of Custom  and  Habit,  that  many  Actions  which  are  no  doubt  voluntary,  and proceed from our Mind, are in certain Circumstances rendered so necessary, as to appear altogether mechanical and independent on our Wills. ('Motions of  our eyes',  II, pp. 213-14)\n\nUnlike Boerhaave, Porterfield did not think that this action actually is mechanical and independent of our wills. He asserts that it is voluntary and directed by the mind. Indeed, Porterfield did not identify voluntary with conscious action. For he acknowledges that we are not conscious of the  motions  of  our  eyelids. It  is  clear  that  we  do  not  have  any consciousness even of an effort of the mind in producing those motions: indeed, what I  am conscious of is the contrary effort to keep my eyes open. But Porterfield did not think that my current consciousness of an inability to keep my eyes open shows that the action is not performed by my mind. He thinks that the true action of my mind is the one which results in the closing of  my eyelids. This arises from a law which I impose on myself through custom and habit.\n\nThe most obvious objection to Porterfield's claim that the closing of the eyelids  is  volimtary is  that we  cannot  do  otherwise.  However, he thinks that there is an important sense in which this is just false. There are people 'who can keep them open, though the Organs subservient to their Motions are the same as in other Men' . He appeals to the case cited in Plempius of Roman gladiators, who, through 'uncommon Fortitude and Courage, had not accustomed themselves on every trifling Occasion to shut their Eye-lids for the Defence of their Eyes' (p. 215). This and other examples show that the shutting of the lids is preventable even for the  rest  of us.  In  his Treatise Porterfield  held  that  in  'philosophical Strictness of Speech' a 'moral  Impossibility'  such as that which we find in the case of the closing of our eyelids 'is indeed no Necessity or Impossibility at all' . Custom still 'leaves the Mind at absolute Liberty to do as it pleases' . One might as well deny the freedom of  an honest man who, having formed a 'fixt and determined Resolution of acting always agreeably to what he sees to be fit and right', finds it impossible to 'do a dishonest  Thing'.  The  impossibility  is  merely  that  'it  is  absurd, mischievous and morally impossible for it to chuse to act .  .  . foolishly\n\nand unreasonably' {Treatise, vol. 2, pp.  I 54 ' 5 )- Like Boerhaave and the Cartesians, Porterfield thought the shutting of  our eyelids contributes to our self-preservation, but he rejected the view of these thinkers that it is automatic-performed by the body without the mind ('Motions of our eyes', II, p. 215). The goal of self-preservation is that of the individual mind itself which freely adopts this way of acting.\n\nIt  is  surprising  to  discover  Porterfield  does  not  even  consider  the possibility  that  what  is  performed  through  custom  and  habit  is performed mechanically. Descartes, Malebranche, and even Locke, had presented mechanical hypotheses-based on the creation of pathways in the brain-to account for the formation of mental and physical habits. While Boerhaave was troubled by the fact that voluntary muscles can move habitually  without  the  action  of the  will,  he  accounted  for  the associations  of  ideas  on  which  such  habits  depend  by  postulating mechanical connections in the common sensory {Lectures, 580.1). Thus he had the basis for the mechanical account of habit developed by his predecessors.\n\nThe chief function of custom and habit in Porterfield's explanation of actions such as the uniform motions of our eyes pnd the shutting of our eyelids was, it seems, that of making them unconscious, and so giving them the appearance of necessity. He wrote that 'the Mind, which at first  always  acted  from  a Principle  of Interest,  comes  at  length  to  be determined  by  Habit  and  Custom,  without  examining  how  far  such motions  may  be  profitable  or  hurtful  to  us,  or  at  least without  being sensible of any  such Examination;  and this  is  the  only  Reason  can  be given,  why  none  of us  are  now  able  to  move  our  Eyes  differently (pp. 214-15, italics mine). This suggests that even after such actions are performed insensibly they may  still  involve a rational  examination of what is the best motion. Perhaps Porterfield thought that when a hand is thrust in my eyes I make a very quick inference that closing them is the most useful  action!  In  any  case,  he  seems  to  have  recognized  that  in allowing  that  the  mind  could  act  insensibly  he  was  stepping  into philosophically dangerous waters. He knew that 'it has been alledged by Locke and others, that all the Thoughts  and  Operations  of the Mind, must necessarily be attended with Consciousness', and that this would be thought to tell against his claim that the actions he was describing were performed by the mind. In the article Porterfield did not want to get involved in the 'metaphysical Question' of the extent that 'Thoughts and  Operations  of the  Mind,  may  or  may  not  imply  Consciousness' (p. 216); though in his later book, he rejected Locke's appeal to direct experience to show that there are times in sleep when the mind is neither 'sensible nor active' . Porterfield claimed that, while direct experience could  not  decide  the  question,  there  were  arguments  to  show  that\n\nanimals  'are always both percipient and active' when asleep.^'  In the essay he limited himself  to the claim that 'there  are  Motions unquestionably  voluntary  and  depending  on  the  Mind,  which  by Custom and Habit have become so easy as to be performed without our Knowledge or Attention'  (II,  p. 217).  While  he  drew back  from his earlier  statement that  such actions  are performed  'without our being conscious  thereof'  (p. 213),  it  is  difficult  not  to  conclude  that  he  is saying the same in different words.^^\n\nThese  views  about  the  unconscious  operation  of  the  mind  are important when, in the second part of  the essay, Porterfield spelled out an earlier suggestion that the mind itself is the efficient cause of the vital and natural operations of  the body. He argued that, if  the mind can think and be 'very little conscious' of it as the Cartesians claimed, 'I see not why  it  may  not  also  be  allowed  to  exert  its  active  Power  in  the Government of the vital and natural Motions, without our Knowledge and Attention'. When children first learn to walk, 'the whole Mind is employed in conducting the Motions necessary for their Progression', so that if  they cease to attend to the activity, they will soon fall down. But when these motions come to be performed easily through custom and habit, 'they need but little Attention, and allow the Mind to employ its most serious and anxious Thoughts about other Matters' (pp. 226-7). By parity of reasoning, when a baby is born, its soul is totally involved 'in  regulating  and  governing  the  internal  Motions,  which  are  yet difficult, by reason it has not yet been much accustomed to them'. But when the soul or mind becomes accustomed to performing vital actions such as the beating of  the heart, and natural actions such as the digestion of  food, it is progressively able to attend to 'external Objects'. Thus the baby comes to appear 'less and less sleepy and unactive' . But what is really happening is that the mind, while it continues to perform them, is able to direct its attention away from the vital and natural operations of its own body (pp. 225-6). Thus Porterfield is suggesting that, just as in the case of the habitual actions which were discussed earlier, these latter continue  to  be  produced  voluntarily  but  without  any  self-conscious awareness.\n\nWhat Porterfield has noted  is  a  common process  by which actions which are self-consciously  chosen come to  be performed without our conscious control. Such actions, for example of the muscles in walking.\n\nTreatise on the eye, vol. 2, pp.  156-9. Porterfield argues that it is especially clear that birds, which have to grip branches in the wind, perceive and put forth some active power. While Borelli, in De motu animalium, had argued convincingly that the 'mechanical Disposition of  the Muscles' is used to help them 'grasp the Branch more forcibly', it is clear, thinks Porterfield, that these muscles alone are not sufficient to account for the phenomena.\n\nPorterfield confuses the issue in his book by claiming that the mind is conscious while asleep. Robert Whytt had no such hesitancy in admitting that the mind acts unconsciously.\n\ncome through custom and habit to be performed without knowledge and attention.  His  suggestion  about  the  control  of the  vital  and  natural operations  of the  body .is  based  on  an  extrapolation  of the  common process to explain a, phenomenon to which we do-not ordinarily think it applies.  The  legitimacy  of this  extrapolation  was  challenged  by  later Scottish thinkers.\n\nIn support of his hypothesis that the vital operations of the body are voluntary, Porterfield also cited evidence which had been presented a few years earlier in George Cheyne's popular study, The English malady. Cheyne  had  described  the  case  of  a  Colonel  Townshend  who  had summoned  him  a  few  days  before  death  to  show  that  he  'could  at pleasure suppress all the vital Motions, so as in all Respects to appear dead, and yet by an Effort, or some how, he could come to Life again, and restore these Motions' ('Motions of our eyes', II, p. 222). Cheyne had reported that he and two other physicians, while doubtful that any such thing was possible 'as it was not to be accounted for from now common Principles', agreed to wimess the experiment. After a half  hour or so the man's pulse was no longer detectable and they assumed he had carried the experiment too far. However, the pulse did finally become detectable again and the man did regain full consciousness.  Cheyne 'went away fully satisfy'd as to all the Particulars of this Fact, but confounded and puzled, and not able to form any rational Scheme that might account for it' . 3 3 In reporting the case, Porterfield wrote Aat it is 'not at all to be accoimted  for,  without  allowing  the  Mind  to  preside  over  the  vital Motions' (p. 222). He appears to have considered this case parallel to that of the  gladiators  who  can prevent  themselves  from  closing  their eyelids when a hand is thrust'in their faces. The unusual case supports the hypothesis that even ordinary heart motion is voluntary.\n\nPorterfield and  Cheyne seem to have believed that the Townshend case provided a kind of crucial experiment which challenged the claim of Boerhaave and his followers that the mind cannot affect the vital and natural motions of the body. However, as we have seen from St Clair's lectures,  the  whole  medical  establishment  was  not  immediately  won over. St Clair challenged physicians like Porterfield and Cheyne to show that they could voluntarily control the beating of their own hearts. They seem never to have taken up the challenge!\n\nOur authors also appealed to the evidence that the vital motions of  the body  are  influenced  by  the  passions  of  fear,  grief,  joy,  rage,  etc. ('Motions of  our eyes', II, p. 222; English malady, p. 68). Boerhaave had\n\n- George Cheyne, The English malady (London 1733), pp. 307-11. Cheyne was a Scot from Aberdeenshire who had studied medicine in Edinburgh with Archibald Pitcairne, one of the leading figures of European iatro-mechanism. Cheyne went to London in 1702, where, as well as setting up a medical practice, he became a member of the Royal Society.\n\nconsidered love and hatred to arise in a kind of automatic way from the effect  of objects  on  us.  In  his  pathology  he  explicitly  identified  the passions  with  mechanical  changes  in  the  common  sensory {Lectures, 744.4). This was in accord with the general conception of die passions espoused by Descartes, who regarded the mental aspect of the passion, that is the feeling, as a kind of epiphenomenon.^^ But writers at this time challenged this  account and argued that the influence of the passions indicated the effect of the mind on the body.^^\n\nPorterfield  and  Cheyne  regarded  themselves  as  breaking  with  the dominant physiological tradition when they presented their accounts of both the nature and extent of the mind's control over the body. At the same time,  both writers  accepted  current mechanical  accoxmts  of the bodily processes themselves. Porterfield wrote that 'we all know there is nothing in the animal Machine but an Infinity of branching and winding Canals,  filled  with  Liquors  of  different  Natures,  going  the  same perpetual Round' ('Motions of our eyes', II, p. 219). He was repeating the  image  set  out  in  the  introduction  of  Cheyne's English  malady. Cheyne told his readers that to understand what he had to  say about nervous diseases, they need only suppose, that the Human Body is a Machin of an infinite Number and Variety  of  different  Channels  and  Pipes,  filled  with  various  and  different Liquors  and  Fluids,  perpetually  running,  glideing,  or  creeping  forward,  or returning backward in a constant Circle, and sending out little  Branches and Outlets, to moisten, nourrish, and repair the Experience of living.\n\nCheyne had even sought to give some satisfaction to 'those acquainted with first Philosophy, Natural History, the Laws constantly observed by Bodies in their actions on one another, and the established Relations of Things' {English malady, pp. 4ff.). Clearly, like Boerhaave, Cheyne and Porterfield thought that the general laws of  mechanics were applicable to organic processes; neither thought that any other laws were required. In order  to  understand  how  these  writers  conceived  of  the  limits  of mechanism in explaining organic processes, it is useful to examine how they  related  their  own  views  to  those  of two  of the  most  important philosophical  systems  of  the  seventeenth  and  eighteenth  centuries, namely Cartesianism and Newtonianism.\n\nPorterfield's  clear  rejection  of  Cartesianism  emerged  through  his criticism of Descartes'  attempt to give a purely mechanical account of animal reproduction from the mixture of  fluids of  the male and female of each species. In the formation of  an animal, Porterfield wrote, 'there is a\n\nSee Passions of the soul, arts.  27, 29 {PWD, vol.  i, pp. 338-9).\n\nSee the interesting argument in Nicholas Robinson, A new system of the spleen, vapours, andhypochondriack melancholy (London 1729), pp. 85-6. This originates with Claude Perrault.\n\nnecessity that the Head, Heart, Nerves, Veins and Arteries, should be formed at the same time', not successively, since none of these organs can operate without the others. But this is impossible, 'for no Motion of any Fluid or Fluids, howsoever disposed, can ever form all these at the same instant' . Porterfield also implicitly criticized the pre-formationist theory which was accepted by most contemporary physiologists.^® Since, as these thinkers admitted, some 'active immaterial Cause' is necessary in the first formation of animals, it is puzzling that 'after that, so great Concern should be shewn to reduce all to mere Mechanism'. Why not agree that the operations of the living body continue to have 'Need of new  Impressions  from  some  such  vital  Principle  as  first  set  them a-going' ('Motions of our eyes', II, pp. 219-21)?\n\nThrough  the  use of  the expression 'active immaterial Cause' Porterfield placed his own claim that the vital and natural motions of an animal body cannot be explained entirely mechanically in the context of the  Newtonian  philosophy  of  his  day.  He  cited  (p. 219)  a  note  in Rohault's System of  natural  philosophy, illustrated with Dr. Clarke's notes taken mostly out of Sir Isaac Newton's  philosophy (1723), in which Samuel Clarke stated that perpetual motion on purely mechanical principles is impossible.  Porterfield argued that there can be no  perpetual  motion machine,  because  'there  is  no  avoiding  a  greater  or  lesser  Degree of Friction,  though  the  Machine  be  form'd  according  to  the  exactest Principles of Geometry and Mechanicks' (p. 218).  In making such an appeal he could also have turned directly to the authority of Newton. Newton had claimed in his Opticks that the mechanical motion in the universe is 'always upon the Decay' owing to the 'Tenacity of Fluids, and Attrition of their Parts, and the Weakness of Elasticity in Solids' . He concluded that, since the variety of Motion which we find in the World is always decreasing, there is a necessity of conserving and recruiting it by active Principles,  such as are the Cause of Gravity, by which Planets and Comets keep their Motions in the Orbs, and Bodies acquire great Motion in falling; and the cause of Fermentation, by which the Heart and Blood of Animals are kept in perpetual Motion and Heat.\n\nThere  are  'active  Principles'  in  the  universe  which  are  required  to recruit  the  constant  loss  of motion;  these  principles  are  identified  as being like those which cause perpetual motion in animal bodies.Even more explicitly, in his famous dispute with Leibniz, Newton's spokes­ man Clarke stated that any sort of  increase in motion in nature must arise from 'a principle of  life and activity'.^ *  In insisting on the importance of\n\n- Among them, Boerhaave.

Alexander (Manchester I 95 ® ) &gt;   P -  112.\n\n274\n\nnon-mechanical  active  principles  in  animal  bodies,  Porterfield  was appealing to a doctrine at the heart of Newtonian natural philosophy.\n\nBut Porterfield also distanced himself  from the form of  the Newtonian philosophy which we have seen refiected in Boerhaave. According to this the motions of  an animate body depend on the same active principles, for example elasticity, as other inanimate bodies in the universe. Porterfield wrote that\n\nIf  it should be said, that these Motions do not depend on Mechanism alone, but on Mechanism join'd with certain active Powers or Forces, imprinted by the Author of Nature upon all the Bodies of this Universe, such as are the Powers of Attraction  and  Repulsion,  by  which  the  greatest  Phaenomena  of Nature  are unquestionably produced; it is.incumbent on those who entertain this Opinion, to  explain particularly how these Motions are thus  continued by these active Principles, before they can expect that we should believe them.  (pp. 221-2)\n\nIn his later Treatise, he took issue with what appears to be a variant of this theory which he ascribed to his great Swiss contemporary, Haller. According to Porterfield, Haller held that the irritability which he had discovered to exist in muscle fibres even after they were cut out of the body, like Newtonian gravitation, results from the stimulus acting as a mere occasional cause of the muscular motion. But Porterfield himself held that 'transient and short-lived Motions', such as those excited by stimuli applied to muscles when they are cut out, can be explained purely mechanically {Treatise, vol.  2,  esp.  p.  167).  It  is  only  the  continued operation of  these and other motions in vivo which requires the existence of an active principle.\n\nThe principle postulated by Porterfield is neither the Deity nor some special  active  material  principle  under  the Deity:  it  is  the  individual mind of the organism which acts continually to keep it going throughout life, and even perhaps, as Cheyne had suggested, was responsible for the first  formation  of  the  animal's  body.  Porterfield  presents  a  specific account of the limits of  mechanism. Nothing in his account requires any other  physical  laws  besides  mechanical  ones.  However,  he  clearly rejected the view, supported by Boerhaave as well as Descartes, that the animal body is an automaton. The processes of that body are not selfmaintaining: they require the intervention of  an active principle peculiar to it, which, as we have seen earlier, possesses both intelligence and will.\n\nThe account of this principle places us in the centre of Porterfield's physiological psychology.  For, as we shall see in the next section, the Newtonian ideas about the limits of mechanism and about the necessity for active powers which he adopted could be given an entirely different physiological interpretation. What is central in Porterfield's discussion is  his  anti-Cartesian  view  that  there  is  a  continuous  transition  from\n\nactions which are consciously chosen to those which are done necessarily and without consciousness. On the Cartesian account such actions were interpreted as undergoing a radical transition from being activities of mind  to  being  purely  physical  operations  of the  body  machine.  For Porterfield, they are considered to have their source in a single principle, the mind itself.  Such actions are considered voluntary because they are chosen, at least initially,  for their usefulness.  We cease to be aware of them because they are performed under the influence of custom and habit.  On Porterfield's account, the criteria that an action is under the control of the mind are that it is learned, and that it is originally chosen because of its usefulness.\n\nThe anti-Cartesian nature of Porterfield's central ideas is clear from an examination of their roots. Cullen identified Porterfield as a Stahlian, but I have found no evidence in Porterfield's writing of any influence of Stahl himself. On the other hand, some of Porterfield's main ideas are clearly  taken  directly  from  an  earlier  writer,  the  French  physician Claude  Perrault.^^  Perrault's  ideas,  developed  in  the 1670s,  were certainly  written  against  the  backdrop  of  Cartesianism.  The  close parallel between their arguments reveals that the same concerns which led Perrault to attack Cartesianism in France in the 1670s were still very much  alive  in  Scotland  in  the  1730s,  though  in  the  latter  case  the philosophical  views  opposed  probably  appeared  largely  within  the context of  Boerhaave's physiology. Put generally, these include the view that  the  mind  only  acts  consciously,  that  the  body  machine  is  an automaton, and that the actions of the mind cannot affect the vital and natural operations of the human body. Porterfield, no less than Perrault, directs his theory against these doctrines\n\nOne central doctrine of  Perrault does not appear to have been adopted by Porterfield, namely the anti-Cartesian position that the soul is not only located in the brain but is literally spread throughout the nervous system.  Indeed,  on  this  issue,  Porterfield  does  adopt  the  gerierally accepted  view  rather  than  that  of  Perrault.'*'   However,  a  version  of Perrault's position was central in the work of Robert Whytt, to whoni I shall  now  turn.  It  emerges  naturally  from  his  metaphysical  commit­ ments and experimental work with animals.\n\n- Many authors, including Haller, have considered Perrault to be a forerunner of Stahl (W. H e r m a n n , The theory of Claude Perrault (London 1973), p .  196). 39\n- ^ See  my  account  of  Perrault  in  'The  embodied  soul  in  seventeenth-century  French physiology', forthcoming.\n- For Perrault's view see 'Du toucher', in Claude and Pierre Perrault, Oeuvres diverses de physique et de mechanique, vol. 2 (Leiden 1721), pp. 529 ff-  Stahl apparently located * e  soul m the brain.  His  view is  contrasted with that of Perrault in Haller's notes  to Boerhaave.  See Praelectiones, III, p. 228, note 3.\n\n■2.'I 6\n\n## IV.  WHYTT  AND  THE  SENTIENT  PRINCIPLE\n\nWhytt appears to have entered the University of Edinburgh in  1728 (matriculating Feb.  1729)  and to have been a student in the fledgling Medical  School  in  the  early  1730s.  Some  of his  student  notes  have survived  and  show  that  at  least  one  teacher  associated  with  medical education at that time was critical of Boerhaave's medical philosophy. Part of  Whytt's notebook is based on his studies with Dr George Young, an  adjunct  teacher  who  practised  as  a  surgeon  in  the  city.  Dr  John Boswell, who obtained the notebook after Whytt's death, wrote in the front that he and Whytt were fellow students under Young in 1730-31. According  to  Boswell,  Young  was  'a  great  Sceptick  in  medicine  (&amp; empirick) as well as in every other thing', and 'confin[ed] himself to good  evident  common  sense' .  But  the  notes  show  that  Young  went beyond  scepticism  to  suggest  that  there  are  absolute  limits  to  the application of mechanical laws in the human body, limits which made the  sorts  of  mechanisms  postulated  by  Boerhaave-or  Porterfieldquite superfluous. Moreover, his 'common sense' appears to have led him to suggest that there are special laws which apply to animal bodies as a result of their being animated by a spiritual being.\n\nOf particular interest for our present purposes are notes entitled 'Of muscular motion'  (pp. 43 iff.)  and  'Of Sensation'  (pp.  467ff.).  Whytt headed the first 'An Enquiry into the Cause of muscular Motion, from Mr Youngs papers', and it is a reasonable assumption that,  since the second note continues many of the same themes and is written in the same style, it too is from Young's papers.\n\nIn the first note Young was concerned with the cause of the motion of voluntary  muscles.  Writers  on  this  agreed  that  the  'free  Influx'  of appropriate fluids from the arteries and nerves was a necessary condition for this motion (since when they are tied it cannot occur) and that the 'voluntary motion of the act of  the will is the ultimate cause'. They also assume that the will must use 'some Instrument to Dilate the muscle', and only  disagree  as  to  'what  is  the  Instrument or  Instruments'  by which  this  is  effected  (pp. 431-2).  Young  runs  through  the  various mechanical  and  chemical  hypotheses  of  late  17th-  and  early  18thcentury writers, pointing out that none of them could be supported by any evidence of the senses: 'the great Boerhaave himself never saw his greater Influx of the animal Spirits by which he accounts for muscular motion' (pp. 434-5).\n\nRCPE,  MS.  M9.19.  George  Young  (1692-1757)  was  a  member  of  an  important intellectual society in eighteenth-century Edinburgh called the Rankenian club.  See M.  A. Stewart,  'Berkeley  and  the  Rankenian club',  in George Berkeley:  essays  and replies, ed.  D. Berman (Dublin 1986), esp. pp. 36-7.\n\nYoung did not reject the existence of all mechanisms which cannot be directly perceived by the senses, but he argued that the only basis for postulating such a mechanism is that it is found together with some other phenomenon which we have  discovered to  be  inseparably  connected with  it  in  our  experience.  Thus  he  considered the  objection  that his rejection  of  unobservables  would  lead  to  the  denial  that  the  blood circulates,  since  'we  cannot  trace  it  through  its  smallest  vessels'. Moreover, 'how shall we know that the sun shall rise to morrow or any thing e&lt;ls&gt;e that is future since they are not yet the objects of  our senses? are not  these  sensible  things  that  are  Discoverable  by  our  Reason?' (p. 436).  His  answer  was  that  the  existence  of  these  items  can  be legitimately inferred, only because the relevant 'Phaenomena of Bodys are so Inseparably connected that we never see' one without the other (p. 438). Such inferences are not only sufficient 'to Direct our Conduct throughout our Life' (p. 439), but for science as well. Thus the reason we know that the blood circulates through the invisible tubes is that 'we perceive it to be a piece of the same order which we have formerly seen, where the whole order was perceivable by our senses' (p. 441). This is like the case of tomorrow's stmrise, only more complex.  Since we have observed closed systems wherein fluid circulates, we can conclude that without  such  intermediate  vessels  the  blood  which  flows  to the extremities 'could not flow in such a proportion and not return'. Unless there were such vessels we wquld observe the blood 'Springing out of the  Extremitys'  (p. 444).  The  evidence  of  our  senses  allows  us  to postulate  the  mechanism. But  there is  no such  evidence  where mechanisms are postulated to account for the motion of the muscles.\n\nYoung's  conclusion  is  not  merely  that  we  don't know what  the mechanism is to account for the dilation of the fleshy part of the muscle when we exert our wills,  but rather that there might very well be no hidden  mechanism-that  is,  any  phenomenon  which  is  in  principle capable  of being  sensed.  He  thought  that  the  search  for  mechanical causes  here  is  like  the  case  where  someone  who  has  traced  out  the mechanical connections of the parts of a watch finally ends up enquiring into  the  cause  of the  elasticity  of the  mainspring.  He  might  form  a hypothesis about the general cause of elasticity and 'foolishly conclude' that no other is possible (p. 442). The postulation of a cause in this case would be arbitrary, since the phenomenon has no relation to any known thing. But, more importantly, we need to stop our enquiries somewhere and, if  we don't stop at the connections we can observe, we shall end up pursuing the 'Invisible mechanism  In Infinitum'  (p. 443 )-He asked how we know in the case of  the spring 'that there is some mechanism in it beyond what we see'. He agreed that there is some cause of  the elasticity, but 'how Do we know its a mechanical cause'? Perhaps it is nothing but\n\n278\n\nthe 'will of  God' (p. 445). In the case of  the muscle, there is a dilation of the 'fleshy Belly' of  the muscle which follows on the act of  the will. Here he is willing to allow that 'there must be something which Dilates the Muscle', but 'whether this something be a Phaenomenon that would be perceivable by our senses if more acute or if it be only the act of the will is  what  we  know  nothing  about.  i,e,  we  know  not  if  there  be  any mechanicall cause of the Dilatation of the muscle' (p. 447). Those who consider that any observable mechanical cause we give is  insufficient, and  who  always  seek  another,  are  really  demanding  a  'mechanicall connection betwixt the Soul (or if  you please the will) &amp; a Living body'. They are really leading us 'to the mechanicall operation of the Spirit of man' (p. 449).\n\nIn  'Of  Sensation'   Young  made  clear  his  belief that  the  scientiflc demand for causal mechanisms is really no more than the demand that a given correlation be subsumed tmder a more general law: 'To Explain the mechanism of any particular Phaenomenon is to reduce it to some common  General  Law  of Bodies  own'd  to  be  such  By  every  Body' (p. 470). Young asked why there need be mechanisms in this sense for all phenomena, for there may be a particular order 'only agreeing to two or 3 bodies'. The particular laws of  nervous action may constitute such an order.  We know that when a certain nerve is  stimulated in a healthy person such and such a sensation follows. But no one has been able to formulate a more general law of nervous action of which these laws of specific nerves can be seen as an instance, and therefore 'it would not be absurd  to say  that  perhaps  there  is  no  other  mechanism  in  our sensations' .  It may be 'a particular Law which only agrees to animal bodies while connected with a Spirit' (pp. 467-71).\n\nHence Young combined a rejection of mechanical explanation with a belief that special laws apply to bodies in virtue of their being animated by an immaterial spirit. These philosophical ideas found fertile soil in the mind of  Whytt. But there were, no doubt, other important formative influences on Whytt. He subsequently studied in London, Paris, Leiden (where he is said to have heard the lectures of the then aged Boerhaave), finally  receiving  his  doctorate  in  Medicine  at  Rheims  in  1736.  He returned to Edinburgh, where he began a private practice in  1737.' * ^\n\nWhytt seems to have begun lecturing on the institutes of medicine in the mid-1740s after St Clair took ill; he was appointed professor in 1747. It  is  commonly  accepted  that  he  used  Boerhaave's Institutes as .2^^ textbook,'*^ but he m t^  have treated central Boerhaavian doctrines in\n\nW. Seller, 'Memoir of the life and writings of Robert Whytt, M.D.', Transactions of the Royal  Society  of Edinburgh 23  (1862);  R.  K.

Whytt's Essay, published  in I75i»  contained refutations of many of these doctrines, including Boerhaave's accounts of  the automatic operations of  the heart and lungs. In the Advertisement there was an extended attack on 'the hypothetical method of philoso­ phizing' where 'causes are usually assigned, which not only cannot be proved to  exist, but which are frequently more intricate and complex than even the effects to be explained from them' (Essay, p. vi). It seems likely that many readers would have agpn this as a challenge to much of the contemporary physiology, pre-eminently that of Boerhaave. Whytt called Boerhaave's explanation of  the mechanical operation of  the heart a ^ ' hypothesis' which, 'however ingenious', was quite inadequate (p. 28). He presented a series of  arguments to show its inadequacy. We have seen how  Boerhaave  accounted  for  the  diastolic  motion  of  the  heart  by supposing that the nervous fluids were cut off by the expansion of the auricles at the end of systole.  But Whytt pointed out that not all the icardiac nerves do pass between the auricles and arteries as Boerhaave supposed, and therefore the nervous impulse to the heart could not be completely cut off. Even if all the nerves did take that route, the external coats of  the auricles and arteries are soft and fleshy, and it is not plausible mat the nerves would be compressed to such an exteijt as to cut off  their itapulse to the heart. There are no other examples in the body of  the kind of temporary  paralysis  of muscles  which  Boerhaave  postulated  and, Jwhen  nerves  are  cut  off  by  being  tied,  their  effect  returns  only /gradually-not suddenly, as required by Boerhaave's mechanism for the heart. Whytt gave eight arguments based on anatomical and physiologi­ cal evidence to show that Boerhaave's hypothesis for the mechanical and automatic operation of the heart just won't work.\n\n' On the other hand, in the first edition of  his Essay, Whytt commended the a priori arguments 'proposed with great strength and perspicuity by my ingenious friend Dr. Porterfield' to  show  'that the motion of the heart  and  circulation  of the  blood,  are  altogether  inexplicable  upon principles  purely  mechanical'  (p. 267).  Whytt  seems  to  have  been referring  to  those  general  arguments  based  on  the  impossibility  of a perpetual motion machine which Porterfield had borrowed from Clarke and Newton. But, since he claimed to have a general distrust of a priori arguments, Whytt added 'a variety of arguments a posteriori, chiefly of the analogical kind', which not only show the impossibility of purely mechanical explanations of the vital operations, but also that they are due  to  'the  immediate  energy  of  the  mind  or  sentient  principle (P- 268).\n\nTo support the view that there can be no perpetual motion in animal bodies,  Whytt  first  appealed  to  the  experiments  of  Stephen  Hales, indicating  that  'in  every  circulation,  the  blood  loses  9/10  of  the\n\nmomentum communicated to it by the left ventricle of the heart'. From this Whytt inferred the need for some 'cause generating motion' within the animal body: 'matter, in its own nature inert, is incapable of this'. He also appealed to observations of hibernating animals, which 'lie in a dead inactive state in the winter' but can be revived again at any time with  a  slight  stimulus  of heat  which  slowly  'excites  the  heart  into action' . To support the conclusion that this action cannot be explained mechanically,  ''^ y tt  appealed  to  the  principle  that  a  cause  cannot produce an effect greater than itself. There is 'some living principle' in these animals, which is capable of generating motion when certain parts of the  body,  such  as  the  heart,  are  aroused  by  some  slight  stimulus (pp. 268-9).\n\nWhile Whytt appealed to experience to show that animals generate motion, he also  seems to  rely  on an a priori principle in drawing the conclusion  that  such  motion  cannot  derive  from  the  body  itself.  He assumed with Newton, Clarke, and others that all increase of motion must come from mind, and that matter itself  is inert and passive. There, is no doubt that this is a central thesis of Whytt's book.  It begins with a motto from Cicero's Tusculan disputations which, according to Whytt, shows that some of the ancients believed that all animal motions derive from 'the energy of  a living principle wholely distinct from the body'.'* ^ In Section XI of Whytt's book there is a passage which suggests that he had been following the recent controversy in Europe surrounding La Mettrie's infamous L'Homme machine. Whytt sees a natural progression from the mechanistic principles of Descartes concerning the motions of anim als  to the dangerous doctrines of La Mettrie concerning man as a machine (pp. 291-2). The latter had been a student of Boerhaave and had  produced  the  French  translation  of Praelectiones  academicae.*^ Whytt piously closed his own book with the hope that, by showing that the motions of  our bodies 'are all to be referred to the active power of  an immaterial principle', he will have shown how 'unjustly the study of Medicine  has  been  accused  of  leading  men  into Scepticism  and irreligion' (p. 391). Should  we  not  read  Whytt's  claim  that  self­ movement of animals is due to an immaterial principle as a mere a priori assumption employed to keep medicine theologically respectable?\n\nHowever, if we do not go beyond this conclusion, we shall miss what is  most  distinctive  in  Whytt's  physiological  m etaphy^s.  When  he ascribed  self-motion  as  well  as  other  specific  properties  of  animate nature to the mind, he was giving a positive account of  the phenomena he was trying to  explain, based on a careful reading of the physiological\n\n- See Essay, p. 266, and Cicero, Tusculan disputations, trans.

The key to his analysis of the involuntary motions of animals lies in his claim that they depend upon the mind acting as 'a sentient principle' (p. 271 et passim). We may question the analogies which he used to draw his conclusion that the mind is involved in the involuntary motions of the body, but in order to understand his theory we need to consider with some care the arguments he employed.  The core of his belief  tliat  the vital and other involuntary motions of  a living body cannot be explained mechanically lay in his observation that such motions rely on  the  reaction  of muscles  to  a stimulus. Whytt  held  that  muscular motion was caused either by the will or by a stimulus, and that it is the latter which causes all the involuntary motions.\n\nIn  Section  X  Whytt  carefully  examined  the  current  theories  of muscular contraction-those based on the elasticity of the muscle fibres themselves, on the elasticity of  the unobservable parts of  a nervous fluid, on chemical explosions,  on electricity,  etc.-and pointed out that the actual reaction of the fibres of living tissue to stimuli is quite different from  what  such  theories  would  lead  one  to  expect  (pp. 229ff.).  For example, the alleged spring-like properties of the parts of the muscle or the nervous fluid do not explain why the muscle reacts in so much more violent a way when it is lightly touched with a needle than when it is struck much harder with a blimt object. Why should a spring react in a violent way to acids 'any more than the mildest milk, or oil of  almonds' (p. 231)? We observe no such reaction in springs large enough for us to see. To those who held that muscular contraction results from a chemical explosion or perhaps  from  'the peculiar  energy  of some very  subtile ethereal or electrical matter residing in the nerves', Whytt replied that none  of these  hypotheses  explains  why  the  muscles  react  to  certain stimuli and not others. Gimpowder requires fire and 'electrical effluvia' require a charged object: but neither is necessary for the stimulation of  a muscle. It makes no difference 'whether the stimulating substances be electrics per se, or now-electrics'  (p. 236).  Whytt went on,  in the first edition,  to  attack  the  view  of  Haller  (as  expressed  in  his  notes  to Boerhaave) that the spontaneous motion of  muscles is due to some latent power in the muscles themselves. In this opening shot in his important dispute with Haller about the cause of  muscular movement, Whytt calls this postulation of a latent power 'a refuge of ignorance' (p. 239). He clearly thought, at least initially, that his own explanation, unlike that of Haller, was based on a principle of which we all have direct knowledge. Finally, Whytt considered the general view of those who say that the 'Author of nature' has endowed the muscle fibres with some matter superior to ordinary matter. Here alone, Whytt's reply seems to be based purely  on  a priori  considerations,  when  he  argues  that  to  claim  that matter  'can,  of itself,  by  any  modification  of its  parts,  be  rendered\n\ncapable of sensation, or of generating motion, is equally absurd, as to ascribe to it a power of thinking' (pp. 241-2).\n\nI Whytt thought that any particular response could  be explained by ascribing it to  'an  active  sentient  pr in c ipl e   animating  these  fibres' . Whytt's  sentient  principle  must  be  understood  as  the  source  of  an inherent sensibility in the nerves of the muscles which causes them to react  in  determinate  ways  to  the  stimuli  which  are  applied  to  them. Whytt thought that this could explain why the application of a stimulus to a bare muscle produces 'instead of only one contraction lasting for a considerable  time, several contractions  and  relaxations  alternately ,   succeeding  each  other,  which  become  gradually  weaker,  and  are repeated  after  longer  intervals,  as  the  force  of the  irritating  cause  is diminished'. When first stimulated, the sentient principle 'determines /the influence of the nerves' into the muscle fibres 'more strongly than /   usual',  in  order  to  remove  the  pain.  However,  as the  feeling of pain diminishes,  the  muscle  reacts  less  often;  indeed  'if  by  one  or  two contractions the irritating cause be thrown off, and, together with it, the disagreeable sensation removed, the muscle will return to its former state ; of rest' (pp. 242-3).  Such contractions are not like those of a vibrating I body which 'performs its vibrations in equal times, whether it be acted upon by  a  stronger  or  a  weaker  force'  (p. 247).  Thus  the  particular I nature of the response in removing the irritating cause indicates that , what is operating is a sensible principle.\n\nIn ascribing the response to a sentient principle, Whytt was not merely making the point that the response is generally the most useful one under the  circumstances.  This  was  also  a  common  observation  among  the mechanist writers whom he opposed, and like those writers he held that the involuntary motions of the body could under certain circumstances turn out to be quite harmful (pp. 289-90). Rather, his central point is that the particular nature of the observed response becomes intelligible when it is seen as a reaction to a pain or uneasiness.  For example, 'if stimuli excite  the  muscles  of animals  into  contraction by  acting upon them, rather as sentient than mere mechanical or material organs, it is easy to see, why the mildest aliment is apt to excite vomiting when the coats of the stomach are inflamed' (p. 256). Here the sensibility of the stomach due to the inflammation explains its violent response to the mild food. The muscle reacts in direct response to the feeling'. Similarly, the response of a muscle is very different when the feeling is constant from what it is where the contraction of  the muscle gives some degree of  relief. Thus 'the causes which produce the erection of tht  penis, though they be generally excited into action by the stimulus of  the  ^eed, yet do not act by alternate fits, because the erection has no effect to lessen the stimulating cause'.  On  the  other  hand, musculi  ejaculatoris  seminis act  through alternate contractions and relaxations because through such actions the\n\nirritation  is  gradually  relieved.  These  muscles  relax  for  a  moment because  each  contraction  briefly  lessens  the  uneasy  sensation  of the stimulus (p. 261). In general, we can understand the nature of  muscular action  if  we  consider  the  muscles  to  be  'endued  with  feeling,  and animated by a Sentient principle' (p. 369).\n\nWhytt's  sentient  principle  explains  animal  motions  as  a  direct response  to  the  degree  of  pain  that  is  felt.  His  most  important contribution to  physiology  is  generally  considered to  be  his  work on reflex action. Through careful experimentation he identifled the spinal cord as the locus of  the reflex in the limbs of  the frog, and discovered that there is a period of  inhibitioh-after the frog has been decapitated in which this reflex is delayed. But his explanation of this phenomenon may seem to be more remarkable than the phenomenon itself. In his Physiological essays (1755) Whytt wrote that 'the great pain occasioned by cutting off the head rendered the animal for some time insensible when its toes were wounded'. Thus the frog's mind is too preoccupied with the loss of its head to react to the relatively minor pain of its toes being pinched!  In support, Whytt appealed to Hippocrates' principle that 'a, greater pain destroys, in a considerable degree, the feeling of a lesser one'.'* ^\n\nWhytt collapsed the distinction which Boerhaave had made between the purely automatic motions of the body and those which arise from some 'uneasy sensation' . For Whytt, all muscular motion must be seen as an attempt to get rid of some 'pain or uneasy sensation'.'* *  This was\n\n- * '  Whytt, Physiological essays, third edn.  (Edinburgh  1766), p. 98.  See F.  Fearing, Reflex action (Cambridge, Mass. 1930), pp. 74-83; G. Canguilhem, La Formation du concept de reflexe aux XVIIe et XVIIIe siecles (Paris  1977), pp.  101-7 et passim.\n\n■ * * Essay, p. 243. Cf. pp. 288-9, where Whytt also writes of 'a disagreeable perception', and likens  the  sentient  principle  to  the moral sense 'whence  we approve  of some actions,  and disapprove of others, almost instantly, and without any previous reasoning about their fitness or  unfimess'.  In Medicine  as  culture:  Edinburgh  and  the  Scottish  Enlightenment (Ph.D., University of London  1984),  Christopher Lawrence concludes  from this  that Whytt 'was drawing on the moral philosophy of  Hutcheson or his followers to develop a new conception of the body' (p. 232).  Lawrence has misunderstood the significance and context of the parallel which Whytt drew. He bases his interpretation on Hutcheson's assertion that desires arise in us to obtain an agreeable sensation when we apprehend a good object, or 'to prevent the uneasy Sensation when it is evil' (Francis Hutcheson, An essay on the nature and conduct of  the passions and affections (London  1728), p. 7).  But there is nothing uniquely Hutchesonian about the concept of uneasy sensation. We have already seen the basic idea present in Boerhaave under the heading 'molesta  perceptio' (rendered as 'uneasy sensation' in the English translation of  the early 1740s). It was Locke who suggested that 'the chief if not only spur to Humane Industry and Action is uneasiness' (Essay, II. xx. 6).  Indeed, Hutcheson was probably criticizing Locke when he wrote against those who held that desire is 'Uneasy Sensation upon the Absence of  any Good'. According to Hutcheson, 'Desire is . . . distinct from Uneasiness' (see D. F. Norton, 'Hutcheson's moral realism', Jottma/ of  the history of  philosophy 23 (1985), at p. 401). The same criticism was levelled explicitly against Locke in Carmichael's dictates on pneumatology at Glasgow C.1711-12 (see C. M.  Shepherd, Philosophy and science in the arts curriculum of the Scottish universities in the seventeenth century (Ph.D., University of  Edinburgh 1975), p.  134).\n\nThe significance of  the parallel which Whytt draws between the operation of  his own sentient principle and the moral sense lies in the claim that both operate without reason and reflection. The passage occurs in a context where Whytt is rejecting the Stahlian system which maintains\n\nthe  principle  operating  when,  under  normal  conditions,  the  heart contracts  in reaction to the  stimulus of the returning blood from the veins: the motions of the heart result from the fact that the nerves of the heart  muscles  are  'highly  sensible,  and  the stimulus is  immediately applied  to  them' (Essay, p. 311).  Boerhaave  had  rejected  just  this explanation by denying that there is a distinct sensation in the muscles of the heart; he had noted that if the distinct motions of the muscles were accompanied  by  sensation  we  would  be  in  constant  pain  from  their continuous operation.  There is, in fact, only a general feeling of pain when the tissues of the heart muscle become inflamed (Lectures, 301.6). As we have seen,  Boerhaave tried to  explain  the motion of the heart according to purely mechanical principles which operate independently of the mind.\n\nWhytt argued that his own accotmt of these phenomena was superior to that of the mechanists for two reasons: it avoided multiplying causes unnecessarily, and it explained the phenomena in terms of  a principle the properties of which are directly experienced. According to Whytt, the mechanists  explained  the  reaction  of different  organs  of the  body  to stimuli  by  means  of  different  mechanisms. Thus  on  groimds  of simplicity alone his explanation of all these motions as resulting from variations in the degree of feeling was superior (Essay, p.  265; cf. p. 4). Perhaps even more importantly, while the mechanists and materialists ascribed the movement of  muscles from a stimulus to a 'hidden property of their fibres  . . .   or other unknown cause', he claimed to show how these  movements  are  'easily  and  naturally  accounted  for,  from  the power and energy of a known sentient prin c iple'  (p. 265). While we may lack theoretical knowledge of how the mind affects the body, 'we know from experience, that it feels, is endued with sensation, and has a power of moving the body' (p. 276).\n\nUnlike Yoimg, Whytt did not deny that there was  some 'material cause in the brain, nerves, and muscular fibres' which the mind uses 'as its instrument' for putting the muscles in motion. But he did argue that such  speculations  were  imnecessary,  in  'a  science  already  labouring imder too many hypotheses' (pp. 325-6). vJ\n\nThere was an obvious objection, at least from the point of view of Boerhaavian physiology, to Whytt's claim that sentience is the principle operating in vital and other involimtary motions. For we are commonly not conscious either of  the stimulus or the 'exertion of  the mind's power'\n\nthat everything occurs in the body through a rational principle. Like the mechanists, Whytt is concerned to establish that basic life processes occur spontaneously. Elsewhere he stressed that moral actions must be accompanied with a consciousness of freedom, and that in this respect they are entirely different from the actions from an uneasy sensation which control our vital functions.  See p. 287 below.\n\nin producing the response (p. 299). In breathing, for example, we are not ordinarily conscious of  the stimulus, though we are sometimes conscious of an effort of the mind in producing the action. (Indeed this action is clearly sometimes volimtary.) In other cases, such as the widening of  the pupil of  the eye, we can be conscious of  the stimulus-^the increase in the intensity  of the  light-but not  the  effort  of the  mind  in  moving  the relevant muscles. In the case of the heart, we are not normally conscious of  either the stimulus or the supposed action of  the mind in producing the contraction  of the  muscles.  Is  not  our  lack  of consciousness  a  clear indication that these actions are not performed by the mind? Whytt tried to answer this in Section X of his Essay  .\n\nHe  suggested  that  our  imconsciousness  of the  stimuli  of our  vital motiofts may be due to the fact that we have become habituated to them and that they are relatively gentle (p. 292). Just as we cease to be aware of the impressions of external objects when they become familiar to us, so we become unconscious of those internal stimuli which have affected us since birth. We always have before us a large number of impressions, though most are so  lost  among  stronger and  more novel  ones  'as  to escape  our  attention  and  memory'  (p. 294n.).  But  we  do  become conscious of them when they affect us with greater strength than usual. For example,  'the sensation arising from the impetuous course of the blood through the pulmonary vessels' (p. 294)-which is, according to Whytt,  the  stimulus  for  the  motion  of the  limgs-is  normally  'very slight as not to be felt or attended to' . But it becomes 'very perceptible' to a person suffering from an asthmatic attack, when it is 'accompanied with the most painful anxiety' (pp. 295-6).\n\nSimilarly, Whytt denied that our lack of  consciousness of any effort in the production of the action is proof that it is not produced by the mind. He assumed that anyone would agree that a motion which arises from an idea must be produced by the mind, and went on to note that such actions are often performed without any consciousness: 'As the erection of the penis often proceeds from lascivious thoughts, it must be ascribed, in these  cases  at  least,  to  the  mind,  notwithstanding  our  being  equally imconscious  of  her influence exerted  here, as in  producing  the contraction  of  the  heart'  (p. 301).  Here  one  is  aware  of  the  idea (memory, etc.) which produces the effort of the mind, but not of the effort itself. Whytt also pointed out that the heartbeat can be increased by certain ideas (e.g.  a frightening thought).  In such a case the mind influences the motion of the heart, but we are not 'sensible of its power being directed to that end' (p. 303). Even voluntary motions 'are many times performed, when we are insensible of  the power of  the will exerted in  their  production'-for  example,  when  one  walks  while  deep  in thought, or while talking to another person.\n\n2 8 6\n\n## John P.  Wright\n\nWhytt's claim that the vital motions are performed by an unconscious action of the mind might make one think that he would be quite open to Porterfield's suggestion that these actions are voluntary.  In fact, quite the opposite.  While, in the first edition of his Essay in  1751,  Whytt's remarks on Porterfield's theory were all commendatory, he distanced his views from those of Porterfield in the second edition in 1763. One factor may have been Porterfield's own criticism of  Whytt in his Treatise on the eye in  1759.  In  1763  Whytt  in  turn  criticized  Porterfield,  'a  subtile defender of the Stahlian doctrine'.'* '\n\nIn his first edition Whytt had criticized the view of the Stahlians that the mind acts as 'a rational agent' in bringing about the vital and other involuntary motions:\n\nWe think it a very clear point, that the mind does not, as Dr. Stahl and others would persuade us, preside over, regulate, and continue the vital motions, or, upon extraordinary occasions,  exert its  power in redoubling  them,  from  any rational views, or from a consciousness that the body's welfare demands her care in these particulars.\n\nHe denied that the mind can rationally control the heartbeat 'when life is  endangered  by  the  too  violent  circulation  of the  blood'.  Rational action  must  take  place  with  consciousness,  and,  since  we  have  no consciousness  of  bringing  about  the  vital  motions,  they  cannot  be performed with reason. According to Whytt, when one acts rationally one  compares  different  alternatives,  and  'in  consequence  of  this comparison' makes a certain choice. But the comparison of alternatives is  a  comparison of ideas, and  'we  cannot but be sensible of the ideas formed  within  us  by  the  internal  operations  of our  minds'.  Unlike sensations,  ideas  exist  only  as  long  as  we  are  conscious  of  them (pp. 285-7).\n\nIn  his  first  edition  Whytt  had  briefly  dismissed  the  view  that  our inability  to  control  the  muscles  of the heart  was  due  to  their having become, like the motion of  the eyes, 'in a manner necessary through long habit'  (p. 286).  In  the  second  edition  he  specifically  identified  this argument  as  that  of  Porterfield.^®  Whytt  argued  for  an  essential difference between muscles like those which control the movements of our eyes and those like the heart:\n\nBut although custom may enable us to perform some actions with surprising facility and little or no attention, yet it will not render the motions of muscles absolutely involuntary, which were originally voluntary.-There is no instance in the human body of any muscle, whose motion can be fairly proved to have\n\n- Whytt, An essay on the vital and other involuntary motions of  animals, 2nd edn. (Edinburgh 1763), P343 n.\n\nEssay (1763), p. 341, paraphrasing from Treatise on the eye, vol.  2, p.  149.\n\nbeen voluntary in the beginning of  life, that has by custom or habit become so fair independent on the will,  as to  be  in no  degree under its  immediate  controul. {Essay (1763), p. 341)\n\nThus, while  I cannot help but move my two eyes together, I  still can decide the speed at which to move them, and the direction.  I have no such control over the motions of  my heart, or the peristaltic motion of  my stomach and guts. Thus there is no reason to think that the actions of these muscles were originally voluntary.\n\nWhytt also took issue with Porterfield's claim that while there was no physical necessity involved in actions performed by custom and habit, there  is  a  'moral  necessity' .  According  to  Whytt,  morally necessary actions must be sufficiently voluntary to allow one to praise or blame the agent, and in order for this to be legitimate they 'must be attended with a consciousness of  liberty' . This consciousness is lacking in the case of  our heartbeat,  or  the  peristaltic  motions  of our  stomach  or  guts.  In  his Pathological Lectures Whytt  told his students that Porterfield's argument that the mind is not conscious of its volitions in producing such motions was based on a 'metaphysical Subterfuge'.^ *\n\nBut Whytt's chief objection to Porterfield's explanation of our lack of control over the vital motions was based on the fact that there is a much more  plausible  explanation.  Even  voluntary  muscles  come  to  move involuntarily when their 'fibres or nerves are irritated' {Essay (1763)5 p. 342).  We  find  throughout  the  animal  body  that  stimuli  produce involuntary motion through an irritation of their sensitive parts. This is clearly the explanation for the fact that the vital and natural motions of our visceral organs are carried out without any sort of  voluntary control.\n\nWhile  Porterfield  and  Whytt  both  rejected  the  Boerhaavian  or Cartesian theory which denied that the mind operates in governing the vital and natural operations of the body, their positive accounts are very different. Whytt's view is that the mind in producing the vital and other involuntary motions, does not act as a rational, but as  a  sentient  principle;  which,  without reasoning  upon  the  matter,  is  as necessarily  determined  by  an  imgrateful  sensation  or stimulus affecting  the organs, to exert its power, in bringing about these motions, as is a balance, while, from mechanical laws, it preponderates to that side where the greatest weight prevails. {Essay, p. 289)\n\nLike the mechanists, Whytt held that those motions which take place independently of the conscious will take place necessarily. They follow as a 'necessary  and  immediate  consequence  of  the  disagreeable\n\n- V  EUL, MS. Gen. 745D, fol. 4.

Neither the means nor the goal of such actions is chosen by the mind which performs them.  Rather, the Deity has  so formed the mind-body connection that 'in consequence of a stimulus affecting any organ, or of an uneasy perception in it' our minds 'immediately excite such motions . . .  as may be most proper to remove the irritating cause' (p. 288).\n\nPorterfield questioned the significance of ascribing body motions to the  'Energy  and  active  Power  of the  Mind'  if those  motions  occur necessarily.^^ He noted that according to Whytt the vital  and natural motions of  the body are 'altogether involtmtary' and are 'not subjected to the Will' ; that in performing these supposed actions the mind 'has no Views,  . .  .  proposes  no  End,  .  .  .  acts  without  Choice'  and  'without Preference  or  Election' .  Porterfield  argued  that  there  is  no  point  in saying that such motions  are 'caused by  the Mind' if,  in  spite  of the addition of sentience, they come about 'by a Law established by the All­ wise Creator' (Treatise, vol.  2, p.  162).\n\nIt is tempting, when one thinks about Porterfield's criticism of  Whytt, to conclude  that, because  he  held  that  the  vital  motions  occur necessarily, there is essentially no difference between his physiological views and those of Boerhaave.  In fact, in a certain respect Porterfield's physiology is far closer to that of Boerhaave than that of Whytt. As we have seen, Porterfield no less than Boerhaave described the body itself  as a hydraulic machine. Whytt, on the other hand, held that one 'must not consider the body as an inanimate hydraulic Machine which stops when one pipe is obstructed, but as composed of exquisitely sensible tubes'. Unlike Porterfield and Boerhaave, Whytt held that the basic principle of animal motion is feeling.\n\nThq difference between Porterfield's and Whytt's explanations of the motions of animal bodies comes out clearly in their differing accounts of the motions of  muscles separated from the brain. In the last section of  his Essay Whytt had presented a remarkable range of cases describing 'the motions  observed  in  the  muscles  of  animals  after  death,  or  their separation from the body' . He realized that some would think that such phenomena  show  that muscles  operate  independently  of the  soul  or sentient principle, but he argued that this is not the case. Since muscles separated from the rest of the body continue to operate in the same way that  they  do  in  the  body,  they  'bespeak  a  feeling,  and  cannot  be explained  without  it' .  Unless  we  assert  that  feeling  is  a  property  of matter we must admit that the sentient principle continues to operate in them (Essay, pp. 389-90).  Whytt  claimed  that  this  is  a  conclusion supported 'by the strongest analogy' (p. 388). But Porterfield argued\n\n- Treatise on the eye, vol. 2, p.  162; cf. Whytt, Essay, p. 302,\n- 'Whytt's clinical lectures  1762-1764': RCPE, MS. Whytt 2, fol. 2.  Italics are mine.\n\nthat Whytt's  account of such motions  was  less  plausible than that of Albrecht von Haller (Treatise, vol. 2, pp.  165-6).  Indeed,  as we have seen,  Porterfield  himself argued  that  such  transient  and  short-lived motions could be explained in a purely mechanical way. In the second edition of his Essay Whytt responded by pointing out that some of these motions were hardly ephemeral:\n\nif  the motions of  a viper' s heart for three days after its head has been cut off, and those of  the heart of a tortoise for six months after the loss of its brain, may be owing to a mechanical power resulting from their particular structure, why may not the motions of the heart in these as well as all other animals, from the beginning  to  the  end  of life,  be  owing  to  mechanism alone}  (Essay (1763), p. 43  m.)\n\nWhytt argued that there is an inherent inconsistency in a view which demands the volvmtary control of vital actions during the lifetime of the organism,  but  is  willing  to  allow  that  they  can  take  place  purely mechanically after destruction of the brain.\n\nHpwever, as Whytt himself recognized, his own view that the motions of separated muscles are under the control of the sentient principle was not  itself  without  problems. In  Section  XI  he  had  favoured  the hypothesis  that  'the  involuntary motions  in man  are not owing  to  a principle distinct froni the rational mind', on two grounds-^that the motions of voluntary muscles can themselves become involuntary, and that in man it is clearly the same principle which is conscious of  thinking and of feeling (pp. 282-5). In general, Whytt favoured the view that the soul is a unity. But, as we have just seen, he also maintained that the soul or living principle does not leave the body immediately after the brain is destroyed  and  conscious  function  ceases.  Does  this  not  show  the independence  of the  thinking  and  sentient  principles?  Moreover,  in holding that the soul is responsible for the motions of  separated muscles, Whytt implied that it continues to act in spatially discrete nerves. Should he not have concluded that there were different  souls  in the  discrete parts?  But  Whytt  argued  that  experiments  with  hibernating  animals showed that the soul acts independently in different parts, even though the  brain  itself  is  dormant.  Moreover,  anyone  who  examines  the structure and function of  the brain will find implausible the view that the mind occupies a single indivisible point. Whytt cited an impressive list of authorities-including Gassendi, Newton, and Clarke-who held that a single unified soul can exist in extended parts. Just as the Deity can act independently in different parts of  space without in any way losing unity or  indivisibility,  so  there  can  be  independent  operation  of the  same unified soul in the scattered parts of animals after death. Any residual problems with this idea he put down to our ignorance of 'the nature of\n\n290\n\nan immaterial substance, its manner of existing, and way of acting upon, or being present with the body' (pp. 377-84).\n\nWhytt's view that the motions of separate muscles must be due to a soul or sentient principle took on a special significance in the dispute with Haller,  which broke out after the  publication of Whytt's Essay. Haller  supported  an  even  more  radical  form  of automatism  than  his teacher Boerhaave. In the notes to his edition of Boerhaave, Haller had asserted in opposition to his teacher that 'the heart is moved by some unknown cause, which neither depends upon the brain nor the arteries, but  lays  concealed  in  the  very  structure  of the  heart  itself' .^ '*   Like Whytt, Haller held that the motion of  the heart was due to the irritability of the heart muscle in  response to  the  return of venous  bl ood. But Haller claimed that irritability is due to a 'physical cause which depends upon the arrangement of the ultimate particles' of the animal gluten of the muscles-though he maintained that, like gravity, the actual cause of the motion is not perceivable ('Sensible and irritable parts', p. 692). Like Boerhaave, Haller asserted that there is a mechanical cause of  the motion of the  heart,  though  he  refused  to  speculate  on  its  exact  nature.  He also  maintained  that  there  can  be  no  feeling  without  consciousness (pp. 677-8). But he went further than Boerhaave in maintaining that the I basic motion of the heart and other such organs is not only independent of  the mind, but also independent of  the whole nervous system. T   aken in this context, Whytt's view that the vital and other involxmtary motions of animals  are  caused  by  the  sentient  principle  came  to  have  a  twofold significance. On the one hand, it signified the dependence of all motions of  muscles on feeling; on the other, it signified the general dependence of such  motions  on  the  nervous  system.  Whytt's  dispute  with  Haller touched on both issues.^®\n\nMuch of the argument on both sides turned on the question of the correct explanation of the motions of muscles which were cut off from the  influence  of the  brain.  Haller argued that these  depended on the irritability of the muscle fibres due to their own vis insita, while Whytt ■ argued that irritability depended on the nervous power which remained in  their  nerves.  Each  brought  an  impressive  array  of experiments  to support his view. Whytt distinguished the metaphysical issues involved from the issue concerning the anatomical source of the living principle.\n\n- '   Albrecht von Haller, 'A dissertation on the sensible and irritable parts of animals', with introduction by Owsei Temkin, Bulletin of the history of medicine 4 (1936), at p. 694.

King (New York 1955), sec.  103.\n\n- For a good recent account of this dispute see F. Duchesneau, La physiologic des lumieres (The Hague 1982), chap. 6 ; also French, Robert Whytf, chap. 6.\n\nThe latter issue can be decided entirely on the basis of  experiment. In the last edition of his Physiological essays in  1766, Whytt noted that even someone who  held  that  the  powers  of the  nerves  are  'owing  to  the particular disposition and arrangement of the matter of which they are composed'  could  adopt  his  view  on  the  relation  of  irritability  to sensibility (pp. 244-5).  He thought that a good portion of his dispute with Haller could be settled by an agreement that life is due to a single nervous power which can be retained for a limited time in the nerves of the muscles after they are separated from the rest of the body.\n\nNevertheless  it  is  also  true  that  much  of the  dispute  hung  on  the differing conceptions of mind adopted by Whytt and Haller.  Haller's most  important  metaphysical  challenge  to  Whytt's  view  was  clearly stated  in  his 1753  paper De  partibus  corporis  humani  sensilibus  et irritabilibus. He noted that Whytt had 'found himself obliged to admit the divisibility of  the soul, which he believes to be separable into as many parts  as  the  body'.  Haller  observed  that  when  the  intestines  were quickly removed from a small animal and cut into four or eight pieces, all moved separately and responded individually to an irritation. He did not think it made sense to maintain, with Whytt, that the soul continues to operate in all of them independently.  In general.\n\nThe soul is a being which is conscious of itself, represents to itself the body to which it belongs, and by means of that body the whole universe. I am myself, and not another, because that which is called I, is changed by every thing that happens to my body and the parts belonging to it. . .  . But a finger cut off from my hand, or a bit of flesh from my leg, has no connexion with me.  I am not sensible of any of its  changes,  they  can neither  commimicate to me  idea nor sensation; wherefore it is not inhabited by my soul nor by any part of it; if  it was, I should  certainly  be  sensible  of its  changes.  ('Sensible  and  irritable  parts', pp. 677-8)\n\nIn this discussion Haller identified self and soul, and denied that there can  be  activity  of  soul  without  consciousness.  The  soul  cannot  be operating in the separated muscles of the body as Whytt claimed, for it does not feel the irritation of those muscles.\n\nIn response to the first part of Haller's criticism, Whytt repeated his claim that the soul need not be divisible, even though it continues to exist in the scattered parts: an 'immaterial substance cannot, like the body, be divided by the anatomical knife,  and  . .  .  the indivisibility of the soul does not depend on the unity of that body which it animates, but on its own  particular  nature' (Physiological  essays, p. 242).  Unfortunately Whytt never really explains the significance of  this unity of  the soul itself after all conscious functions cease, beyond what he had already set forth in his Essay.\n\n292\n\nIn response to the second part of Haller's objection, Whj^t made an important distinction between the nature of feeling as  it exists in the periphery of  the nervous system and as it exists in the brain. He held that it  is  probable  that,  even  in  living  animals,  the  soul  is  'present  every where in the body', and that 'there may be some kind of feeling or sensation excited in the nerve  itself'  which  causes  the response to a stimulus  (p.  I55n.).  Whytt  carefully  distinguished  the  location  of 'simple sensation' from that of sensation accompanied with conscious­ ness. Thus the soul 'can only taste in the tongue, smell in the nose, see in the eyes, hear in the ears, and feel hunger in the stomach'. On the other hand, it exercises the power of 'reflex consciousness and reason' only in . the brain. Consciousness is due to a 'reflex act, by which a person knows his thoughts or sensations to be his own' . When communication with the  brain  is  cut off,  the  part  of the  body  can  still  retain  its  power  of sensation through the peripheral nerves and so react for a time to stimuli. But it is no longer able to communicate that sensation to the brain where it can become conscious (pp.  1558). In a footnote to the final edition of his Essay Whjrtt referred to the sensation which is retained in the parts of  muscles separated from the rest of  the nervous system as 'some kind of feeling or simple sensation (such as oysters or other animals of  the lowest class, who have no brain are endued with)' (Essay (1763), p. 433n.).\n\nThe metaphysical issue between Whytt and Haller turns largely on their different conceptions of the soul. For Haller, like Boerhaave, the essence of the soul is to be conscious. For Whytt, the soul is essentially that which gives life to the body and which is only conscious in so far as it performs its operations in the brain. As we have seen, Whytt thought that his contemporaries rejected his view of the soul partly because they still retained Cartesian principles, and partly because they had become too enamoured of mechanical reasoning in physiology. Perhaps Haller's imwillingness  actually  to  give  a  mechanical  accoimt  of the vis  insita blunted  the  force  of the  second  part  of this  criticism,  but  the  first remained entirely relevant to their dispute. Whytt rejected that form of Cartesian dualism which maintained that the vital and other involuntary motions of animals are independent of the thinking principle-the view which was most forcefully set out by Haller. In his account of  the soul or mind Whytt reaffirmed its essence as the principle of life and maintained the centrality of feeling as the root of all life processes.\n\n## V.  CULLEN'S  GEOGRAPHY  OF  THE  MIND\n\nIn 1766, after Whytt's early death, William Cullen resigned his position as  professor  of Chemistry  at  the  University  of Edinburgh,  and  was\n\n'\n\nappointed professor of the Theory of Medicine.  Over the next seven years he gave five year-long courses of lectures on physiology.'  In 1772 he  published his Institutions of  Medicine, containing only short propositions, which were discussed at length in his lectures. In the latter, Cullen considered the physiological views of  a number of  his contempor­ aries, especially Whytt, Haller, and Jerome Gaub. His own views are not always  easy  to  discover,  because  he  employed  a  sceptical  style  of reasoning, balancing one contemporary doctrine against another. But, like  Hume,  Cullen  was  an academic sceptic  who  used  this  type  of reasoning to reach conclusions which he thought highly probable He provided a dialectical synthesis of his predecessors'  views by applying what Hume had called 'mental geography' (E.  13)-that is, through a careful  analysis  of the  powers  of the  mind.  It  was  through  such  an analysis  of sensation  and  volition,  albeit  one  which  rested  partly  on Cartesian principles, that Cullen showed the extent and nature of the interaction between mind and body.\n\nAs I indicated in section I, Cullen regarded this mutual interaction as of major concern to physiology. In what appears to be a supplementary private  note  on  his  lectures  from  the  mid-1760s,  he  wrote  that  the problem of the action of the mind on the body reduces to the problem 'how one State of the body or of one part can affea another part of it'. He identified the mental states or faculties as 'thought. Intellect &amp; will' . The  reason  they  had  been  generally  ascribed  to  'a  Substance  very different  from our bodies'  is  that the mechanism  by  which  they  are produced 'is not &lt;at&gt; all obvious'. Nevertheless, he pointed out that they are clearly 'inseparable from some conditions in the body'. Cullen adopted the doctrine of  two substances and their connection espoused by Boerhaave and Haller, who had never been 'Suspected of irreligion', but  this  dualism  and  the  problems  connected  with  it  were  of  little intellectual  concern  to  him.  The  important  problem  concerning  the influence  of mind  on  body  was  a  problem  of how  certain  states  of the brain-namely mental ones-affect those of other organs such as the heart:  'This  is  a problem to  the  Solution  of which we  may  hope to attain.''\n\nWhytt and Porterfield had opposed Boerhaave's view that the essence of  mind or soul is to be conscious. It is therefore striking to discover that, in  spite  of his  alleged  opposition to the  system of Boerhaave,  Cullen\n\n- Thomson, Life of Cullen (note 6 above), vol.  I, p. 458.\n- 5 *   On Cullen's recommendation of 'the slow consenting Academic Doubt', see J.  R. R. Christie, 'Ether and the science of chemistry', in Conceptions of ether, ed. G. N. Cantor and M. J. S. Hodge (Cambridge 1981), esp. p. 92. Christie ties this academic scepticism with that of Hume, stressing the importance of a cautious acceptance of hypotheses-especially that of the aether-for both thinkers.\n- »  'Lectures on physiology': RCPE, MS. Cullen 16(1), preliminary folios.\n\n294\n\nfollowed him in holding that consciousness characterizes what is mental. This is clear from his analysis of the concept of sensation. In his lectures in  the  fall  of  1770,  Cullen  said  he  followed  Hume  in  distinguishing sensations from ideas -that is, from the thought of 'an Object absent arising  from  Reminiscence'.  A  sensation  is  a  thought  which  arises directly from an 'external Impression or certain other Changes in the Body'. Cullen went beyond Hume (and Whytt) in carefully distinguish­ ing sensations from impressions-that is, from the motions in the body which are their causes.*® Cullen defined 'sensation' in general as 'the Mind's being conscious of any changes in the State of the body, or more nearly of the Nervous System' (fols. 89-90, my italics). In proposition 49 of his Institutions he asserted (with Haller) that the mind can have or attend to only one sensation at a time, thus rejecting Whytt's suggestion that the mind can have a number of unconscious sensations at any given moment.  Finally,  in  his  1770  lecture  on  proposition  122,  he  stated plainly that 'to say there is  Sensation without Consciousness is to me almost a Contradiction in Terms' (fol.  160).\n\nUnlike Whytt, Cullen held that processes of the body can take place purely automatically-that is, without being accompanied by any mental state. Herein we see the significance of  his distinction between sensations and impressions. In proposition 80 he asserted that 'certain impressions and certain states of the body  . . .  may  . . .   act on the nervous  system without producing any sensation' ; and in proposition 122, that 'many impressions have their affects without sensation and volition'.  Indeed he  held  that  fundamentally  our  vital  and natural  motions  are  of this nature. In proposition 119 he maintained that 'the motions of the heart and arteries, of the organs of respiration, of the stomach, intestines and perhaps other parts'  are caused by  'certain internal impressions  .. . which produce no  sensation,  nor motions  of which we are  conscious except  when  exercised  in  an  unusual  manner' .® '  Cullen  did  accept Whytt's view (opposed to Haller) that the motions of  muscles are always\n\nAfter distinguishing sensations from ideas, Cullen wrote: 'In this point I follow David Hume; he indeed uses the Term Impression instead of Sensation, but I employ Impression in another place  I  think more  properly, nor would  Impression  convey the whole meaning of Sensation,  but only  as  far as  it  arises  from the body.'  (NLS  Cullen,  fol. 80).  On Whytt's interchangeable use of 'impression'  and 'sensation'  see sect.  IV above.\n\nIn an article which is widely referred to ('The nervous system and society in the Scottish Enlightenment', in Natural order: historical studies of scientific culture, ed.  B.  Barnes and  S. Shapin (Beverly Hills 1979), 19-40), C. Lawrence cites this passage to support the conclusion that Cullen 'retained all the characteristics of Whytt's sentient principle-purposeful action, coordinating ability, and, most importantly, unconscious feeling -without introducing second substances into physiology' (p. 26, my italics).  I can see how this passage could be read as Lawrence reads it when taken out of the context of the rest of  the Institutions, but I cannot see how it can be so read in the context of propositions 80,  122, and numerous comments in the lecture notes. For reasons set out in the last section I also consider quite misleading Lawrence's view that Whytt thought the vital motions are carried out through any 'purposeful action'.\n\ndue to some form of nervous power, and he stressed that in the living body they require a constant energy from the brain (props.  96, 97).® * However, he drew an entirely different metaphysical conclusion from Whytt's. For Cullen, the fact that 'some of the Functions of  our System can be performed without Sensation or Volition' gives 'a strong Proof of the Brain's  being a Mechanical  Organ'  (NLS  Cullen,  fol.  1465  cf. Institutions, prop.  116).\n\nIn  proposition  122  Cullen  balanced  this  against the  claim  that the mechanism of the  brain  is  insufficient  'without  being  united  with  a sentient  principle  or  mind  that  is  constantly  present  in  the  living System'. He argued for this partly on epistemological grounds, because 'the mechanism of the brain suited to its several functions is not at all perceived'. Unlike Boerhaave, Cullen did not think that mental states are, for practical purposes, reducible to their mechanical causes. But he also gave a more positive reason: very few of the functions of the brain are 'carried out without sensation and volition'  (prop.  122). Here he appears to agree with Whytt's claim that the sentient principle operates throughout the body. We need to consider how this is reconcilable with Cullen's assertions about vital and natural motions which we considered in the last paragraph.\n\nWhile  Cullen  appealed  to  the  authority  of Whytt  in  support  of a sentient principle, he took issue with Whytt's view that sensation takes place  in  the  peripheral  nervous  system,  apart  from  the  brain  itself (NLM, II, fol. 243). But their different accounts of the operation of the sentient principle go deeper than that.  Since Cullen identified mental functions with conscious ones, he held that basic life functions can go on independently of the mind.  At the  same time he criticized Whytt for holding with Boerhaave that our visceral fvmctions are carried on with an absolute  necessity,®^  without  any  kind  of influence  by  the  conscious mind.  For  Cullen,  the  sentient  principle  influences  our  basic  life functions, but as an independently identifiable principle whose effects on those functions  can be determined by experience.  While he began from a basic acceptance of  what I earlier called ftmction dualism, Cullen asked himself just how those  states  of the  nervous  system which  are mental interact with those on which our basic life functions depend.\n\nCullen  regularly  returned  to  what  he  called  the  ' Stahlian  contro-\n\nCullen  seems  to  adopt  the  position  suggested  by  Whytt  in  the  last  edition  of  the Physiological essays, discussed in section IV above. . . . · u-\n\n'But to understand Boerhave you must observe this Application of these Doctrines to his System in his Definition of Disease, where he says the  Consideration of the Mind is to be neglected.  . . .  He explains this still more particularly . . . where he expressly says Omne hoc pendet &amp;c.----- mechanica dispositio. . . .   I  join with Boerhave, Dr Whytt, who after taking much pains in his Vital Functions, to prove the Existence of  a Sentient Principle.. . thinks that all our Motions are directed by a Physical Necessity.' (NLS Cullen, fol. 76).\n\n296\n\nversy'-the question whether the mind volimtarily directs the vital and natural motions  of the body.  At the  beginning  of his  lectures  on the nervous  system,  he  said  he  was  following  Gaub  in  subscribing  to  a compromise between the view of Boerhaave and Whytt on the one hand and that of the  Stahlians on the o t h e r . T o  imderstand this we must examine his mental geography of volition-that is, his account of the extent and manner in which the mind can be said to have control over our bodies.\n\nIn proposition 119, Cullen listed seven causes of  the action of  the brain in  bringing  about  changes  in  the  body,  five  of which  are  said  to  be 'modes of volition' (NLM, III, fol. 49). These include the operation of the  will  in  performing  voluntary  actions,  the  passions,  imitation, appetites  directed  to  external  objects,  and  propensities  to  remove  an uneasy sensation.  In arguing that 'some Volition is concerned' in the last of these, Cullen gave an idea of just what he meant by 'volition'. A typical case of a propensity which arises from an 'uneasy sensation' is the voiding of  urine and faeces. In such cases the relevant motions 'can often be prevented by another volition presenting itself  ', and we can put forward greater or less effort in exercising them {Institutions^ H9-5)-\n\nThe Excretion of Urine is often very urgent, yet a Lady in company with men will restrain this Propensityj neither will a well bred Man expel wind by the Anus in company with Ladies; he can restrain it. ... [A] Man in going to Stool .. .in pressing  out Faeces.. .holds his Breath in  order to give a greater  Effort, &amp; if it is still more difficult, he grins most horridly. (NLS Cullen, fol. 152)\n\nThe number of muscles  which  come  into play  is  determined  by  the degree of effort which is put forth (NLM, II, fols. 271-2). While Cullen did  not  deny  that  motions  from  an  uneasy  sensation  are  sometimes caused without any volition-that is, without the ability to do otherwise or to put out greater or less effort-the paradigm is those in which some volition  is  involved.  In  contrast,  we  should  remember  that  Whytt postulated a sentient principle to explain those involuntary motions of the body which, according to him, were necessarily determined by the uneasy sensation.\n\nVolitions, in Cullen's wide sense, constantly affect our vital functions. While the basic motions of my heart and lungs are carried out purely mechanically, they are constantly affected by my passions, i.e.  'more general and vehement volitions' {Institutions, 119.2). There is 'nothing more evident than that the passions of the mind affect the motion of the\n\n^ NLS Cullen, fols. 76-7. For Gaub's views on mind and body see L. J. Rather, Mind and body in eighteenth-century medicine (Berkeley  1965).  Rather stresses the difference  between Gaub's view of  the passions and that of  Descanes. For Gaub,like Ponerfield and Cheyne, they are actions of the mind. This view seems to be shared by Cullen.\n\nheart'-for example, anger will produce a violent beating of the heart and  grief  will  slow  it  down  (NLM,  II,  fol. 274).  Though  Cullen considered the passions to be 'modifications of the will', he noted that they are generally instinctive in so far as they arise directly in response to a certain sensation. When we are angry, even the outward motions of  our bodies  often  arise  without  our  having  much  awareness  of  them. However, Cullen also stressed that when our passions are not too violent we have some degree of conscious control over the relevant motions.\n\nBut it is not only those volitions which are essentially instinctive which affect our vital motions  i some are also constantly affected by what are clearly volimtary actions. Cullen wrote that 'there is no proof of  any one muscle of the body being more under the power of the will, than the action of respiration' (NLM, II, fol. 273). The rate and manner of my breathing is affected by a number of my voluntary actions,  including talking.  Does  this  not mean that  Cullen followed Porterfield  and  the Stahlians in holding that we have voluntary control over the vital and natural motions of our bodies?\n\nCullen's mental geography of the will consisted of  two elements, both basically Cartesian. First, he held that the will is a mode of thought and that what we will is only that which we are immediately conscious of willing.®^ In bodily motions subjected to the will 'the Mind only wills an End.. . . We know nothing of  the particular muscles put in action. When I bend my arm, I commonly only attend to the contraction of the Biceps, but Winslow has shewn that many other Muscles partake in that Action' (NLS Cullen, fol.  161: cf. Institutions, prop.  119.1). Cullen denies that we have anything but a very limited and general consciousness of the parts of  our bodies moved, and draws the conclusion that we will only the general movements of a limb or muscle.\n\nRelated to this is his  second  Cartesian principle, that 'in the moral Administration of the System only a general end or purpose is in view, &amp; the Almighty Creator has connected certain Motions with the  Volition of these Ends' (NLS Cullen, fol.  161; my italics).  Thus there are certain motions of  our body naturally or originally connected with the willing of certain general goals or purposes. To take Descartes' own example, 'if we want to adjust our eyes to look at a far-distant object, this volition causes the pupils to grow larger' {PWD, vol. i, p. 344). I cannot directly will the bodily motions, but only certain general conscious aims to which they are naturally joined. Both Descartes and Cullen held that through custom and habit these original connections of ideas and bodily motions\n\nFor Descartes' view see PWD, vol. 2, p.  113, Def.  I .  This new translation of Descartes' works unhelpfully translates the Latin 'immediate conscii sumus' by 'we are immediately aware'. As McRae and Rodis-Lewis (note 16 above) show, Descartes was using 'conscii' in a new and important way which became fundamental in modern philosophy.\n\n2 9 8\n\ncould be changed so that the willing of a quite different idea could bring about the relevant bodily change.\n\nFrom these two principles Cullen concluded that, while my passions or even my voluntary actions affect the vital motions, it is not in the way that  the  Stahlians  thought.  In  general,  we  do  not  directly  will  the motions of individual muscles, nor do we have any distinct conscious­ ness of bodily sensations. While he accepted Porterfield's and Perrault's claim  that  the  uniform  motion  of our  eyes  was  originally  voluntary (NLM, II, fols.  lo i- i I ; cf. Institutions, prop. 55), he did not accept that certain motions of muscles were chosen over others in order to achieve the goal of forming a distinct image of the object. Rather, it was merely by willing the general end of seeing objects distinctly that the motions of the  muscles  became  uniform.  Moreover,  most  of  us  have,  through custom  and  habit,  come  to  perform  this  action  completely  without consciousness,  and hence the mind is  no  longer  involved  in  it  (NLS Cullen, fol.  153).\n\nCullen  held  that  many  motions  which  we  may  consider  to  be involuntary, including vital and natural ones, are not entirely so. But he showed  exactly  how  such  motions  can  be  a  matter  of voluntary  and rational choice.  In his  1772 lecture on proposition 119, Cullen told his students that he differed from other physiologists with regard to  'the extent of  the powers of  the mind or with regard to the manner of  acting' . He distinguished the question whether the visceral motions are affected by the mind from the question whether they are 'directed' by the mind. Consideration  of  the  passions  and  unintended  effects  of  voluntary actions  shows  that  the  motions  of our  internal  organs  are  constantly affected by the mind. However, like Porterfield and Cheyne, Cullen held that vital  motions  such  as  those of the heart  can be  'directed by the mind',  though  for  him  it  is  only 'in  one  limited  sense'' ' (NLM,  II, fol. 287). The mind controls the body through conscious rational choice. The question is how, through conscious choice of a certain means to end relation, we might be able to control the motion of our heart and other internal organs.\n\n■   Cullen maintained that when we are calm we have some control over our passions through imagination, and that in so far as the passions are voluntary  both  these  and  the  internal  motions  of our  bodies  are  also under our control. Clearly, we can under certain circumstances control our  passions  by  directing  our  thoughts  in  a  certain  way-that  is,  by choosing to think of  certain objects with which our passions are naturally joined. We have 'a power whereby we can recall these objects that give us anger or fear'.  Cullen recalled that\n\nThere is a famous instance of Colonel Townshend by Dr. Cheyne who stopped his  heart  at  pleasure  and  died  when  he  thot  proper.  I  can  explain  it.  .  .  .  By\n\nrecollecting an object of  fear we can diminish its action, and [by some such way as this] Colonel Townshend had power over his heart. So have no doubt that we can by recalling one or other of  these passions make it voluntary, and if  you will a certain end, it has the power of  exciting a variety of  actions and combining these together, at the same time the heart.\n\nThus the mind can control the motion of the heart. Cullen's idea is that Townshend was able to do it, not by directly desiring that his heartbeat should decrease in frequency, but rather by calling up certain thoughts which have that result. He suggested that perhaps  'that power might have been greater and &lt;been&gt; destroyed by repetition' . Apparently he thought that many of us have lost the power of controlling our passions and the related motions of our bodies by calling up certain ideas.  He concluded that 'the heart itself is not clearly separated by the voluntary motions in a certain view of it' (NLM, II, fols. 273-5).\n\nThis clearly does not mean that Cullen sided with Porterfield and the Stahlians on either the manner or the extent of the mind's control over the body. He limited such control to our conscious choice, and while, apart from such choice, the motions of  the body are affected by the mind, they are not voluntary. Earlier Cullen did consider the possibility that all actions of  our internal organs may originally have been voluntary like the motions of our eyes,  and only became automatic through custom and habitj  but he  argued  that  this  is  improbable,  given  that  in  adults  an internal organ can react to new stimuli without their being in any way conscious of it or requiring any process of habituation. Moreover, the kind of control which Cullen envisioned over our internal organs is only of the  most  general  kind-not  involving  a  choice  of the  operation  of specific muscles. This is essentially what was proposed in section 45 of Descartes' Passions of the Soul:\n\nOur passions, too, cannot be directly aroused or suppressed by the action of  our will, but only indirectly through the representation of things which are usually joined with the passions we wish to have and opposed to the passions we wish to reject. For example, in order to arouse boldness and suppress fear in ourselves, it is  not sufficient to have the volition to do so. We must apply ourselves to consider the reasons, objects, or precedents which persuade us that the danger is not great. {PWD, vol.  i, p. 345)\n\nDescartes himself had recognized the importance of such control of our passions  for  health  and  disease  in  his  correspondence  with  Princess Elizabeth.®®  But  both  Cullen  and  Descartes,  because  they  limit  the\n\n'  Descartes  to  Elizabeth,  May  or  June  1645, Oeuvres  de  Descartes, vol.  4,  pp. 218-22. Theodore Brown, in 'Descartes, dualism,  and psychosomatic medicine'  (in The anatomy of madness, ed. W. F. Bynum and others, vol. i (London 1985), at p. 52), implies that Descartes cannot consistently hold that the mind can affect the passions. Brown is certainly correct that Descartes considered the passions themselves to arise directly from somatic states, but it is also consistent with the central principles of  his philosophy that Descartes gives the mind an indirect control over the passions.\n\n3 0 0\n\nmind's  operations  to  those  of which  we  are  conscious,  have  a  more limited  conception  of  the  mind's  control  over  the  body  than  did Porterfield, Perrault, and the Stahlians.*^\n\nStill, we may want to ask whether, in admitting that the mind can act independently of sensation in voluntary action (NLS  Cullen, fol. 78), Cullen was not allowing with Porterfield and Whytt that it has special active  powers not  possessed  by  inanimate  matter. Indeed,  at  the beginning of his  1772-73  lectures Cullen said that he did not want to deny  that  'the  soul  has  a  power  of  beginning  motion'  (NLM,  II, fol. 35). He later noted that 'Causes that in no part of nature have any tendency  to  excite  motion-but  rather  diminish  it  .  . .  are  frequent Causes  of it  in  animal  bodies'  (fol.  280).  (He  claimed  that  when  a depressant drug such as opium is given, sometimes the brain is excited instead of  relaxed by it.) He regarded the healing power of  nature itself  as a kind of active power in the animal economy (fol. 276-80). Neverthe­ less, there are good indications that Cullen thought that such properties resulted from a certain kind of matter,  not from a substance  entirely immaterial.®* While he was very cautious in putting forward a theory of animal  electricity,  he  admitted  that  his  important  neurophysiological concepts of 'excitement and collapse' first occurred to him when he was formulating a 'Theory' from 'an Analogy I observed in the Phaenomena of electricity'  (NLS  Cullen, fol.  185).  There is  reason to think that,  like Hume,  Cullen asked himself whether 'it is more difficult to conceive that motion may arise from impulse than that it may arise from volition?'  (E. 73).  And  like  Hume,  he  appears  to  have  answered  by speculating on the possibility of an active matter.®^\n\nIn general, we can conclude that Cullen provided a solution-within the context of a Cartesian metaphysic-to the function dualism which we foimd  so  clearly  expressed  in  Boerhaave.  Like  Boerhaave,  Cullen\n\nIt is tempting to think of Cullen's account as providing an explanation for a crude form of what  today  we  would  call  'biofeedback'.  But  for  Cullen,  like  Boerhaave,  we  never  have anything but a general sensation of  the motions of  the heart and other internal organs. Modern biofeedback phenomena appear to require continuous information about very specific changes in the condition of the body (G. Jones, Visceral learning (New York 1973)). Moreover, it is difficult to see how such phenomena could be explained on Cullen's Cartesian model of  the will, which is based on the notion of an original correlation between the willed idea and the body motions.\n\nIn stating the point in this way I have in mind Cullen's discussion in his lectures on the history of chemistry: 'Aether and Inert matter are hence supposed to be the oply matters in nature' (RCPE, MS. Cullen 10(1), fol. 87).\n\nOn Hume's comments on the aether hypothesis see my Sceptical realism of David Hume (note 30 above), pp.  145,  l6lff.; also Christie, in Conceptions of ether (note 58 above).  In his 1772-73 physiology lectures Cullen became very defensive about his claims regarding animal electricity  (NLM, III, fols.  15-19), probably in response to the attack on his student G. R. Brown's dissertation in the article on Aether in the first edition of  the Encyclopaedia Britannica. See R. K. French, 'Aether and physiology', in Conceptions of ether, at p.  118.\n\nmaintained that the basic life functions are carried out independently of the mind. He argued that in one sense the visceral organs are constantly influenced by the mind, though their activity is not voluntarily willed; this  influence  is  clearest  in  the  case  of the  passions.  But  Cullen  also argued that to a limited degree our corporeal functions can be voluntarily controlled by the mind-that is, by imagining certain objects which are naturally  and  habitually  conjoined  with  our  passions.  Thus,  while Cullen held that there is a basic dualism between mental functions on the one hand and vital and natural ones on the other, he also showed the nature  of  the  causal  relation  between  them.  This  causal  interaction cannot,  according to  Cullen,  be  described in mechanical terms,  since descriptions of  mental processes are not in practice reducible to physical ones.'® Thus, in Cullen's physiology, unlike that of Boerhaave, it was essential to discuss the conditions of  mind conducive to life and health.''\n\n## Department of Philosophy\n\nUniversity of Windsor\n\n- But such a reduction appears to be possible in principle. In his 1770 lectures, Cullen wrote against the Stahlians that 'the force of impression is every where absolute; &amp; it is according to the  force  of impression,  and other  mechanical  conditions  of the  System,  that  the  motions excited prove either salutary or pernicious' (NLS Cullen, fols.  159-60).\n- '  This paper was written in  1986-87 while I  was a visiting member of the  Institute for Advanced Study (Princeton) and received a Grant-in-Aid from the Institute.
