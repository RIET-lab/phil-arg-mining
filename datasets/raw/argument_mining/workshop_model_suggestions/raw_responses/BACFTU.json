This paper  introduces  and  contrasts  two  central  strategies  for  approaching  the question of the divine in a non- or post-ontotheological manner. The first and more  established  approach  is  that  of  post-Heideggerian  hermeneutics  and deconstruction, inspired by Heidegger's suggestion of a 'theology without the word 'being'' and by his later notions of an 'ultimate god' and of 'divinities' as one of the four axes of the fourfold ( Geviert ). Here, the divine is no longer articulated  in  terms  of  the  supreme  or  absolute  being,  but  as  one  of  the interdependent dimensions of finite and contextual meaningful presence. The more recent approach introduced by Alain Badiou and Quentin Meillassoux dissociates itself from the Heideggerian hermeneutics of finitude and adopts mathematics as its basic ontological model. Rather than focusing on meaning and sense, Badiou and Meillassoux replace ontotheological metaphysics with materialist frameworks. With regard to the divine, this approach leads either to  a  contemporary version of atheism (Badiou) or to the reintroduction of a divine entity, but now a merely possible and contingent one (Meillassoux).\n\nKeywords : Heidegger, Badiou, Meillassoux, ontotheology, metaphysics, God, divine, theology, hermeneutics, materialism\n\n## 1. Hermeneutical and materialist post-ontotheologies\n\nThe  concept  of  ontotheology  and  the  analysis  of  the ontotheological constitution of the Western metaphysical tradition-of the inherent tendency of metaphysics to posit an absolute point of reference for all beings, identified by Aristotle\n\nand Aristotelian Scholasticism with the metaphysical divinityhave  been  among  the  most  prominent  aspects  of  Martin Heidegger's philosophical legacy. The hermeneutical and deconstructive  'weak'  perspectives  on  theology,  religion,  and the  divine  introduced  by  thinkers  such  as  Jacques  Derrida, Gianni Vattimo, Jean-Luc Marion, John Caputo, Richard Kearney, and Merold Westphal have been particularly inspired by Heidegger's allusion, in a 1951 seminar in Zürich, to the idea of  a  theology  without  the  word  'being' 1 -hence  the  title  of Marion's God without Being ( Dieu sans l'être, 1988)-and by the enigmatic and underdeveloped description, in Contributions to Philosophy ( Beiträge zur Philosophie , 1936-38) , of an 'ultimate god'  ( der  letzte  Gott )  that  is  sharply  differentiated  from  the ontotheological God of Aristotelian metaphysics and Christian Scholasticism. In France, the prominence of the postHeideggerian  philosophical  interest  in  religion  was  addressed by  Dominique  Janicaud  (1991;  Janicaud  et  al.  2000)  as  a 'theological turn' in French phenomenology.\n\nHowever, in recent years, we have witnessed the emergence  of  a  very  different  approach  to  ontotheology-one that,  to  a  certain  extent,  accepts  Heidegger's  diagnosis  of  a strong ontotheological tendency inherent in Western metaphysics, yet rejects many of the philosophical consequences that Heidegger draws from this diagnosis. This is the avenue introduced by Alain Badiou and further developed by his pupil, Quentin Meillassoux. For Badiou and Meillassoux, the  closure  of  ontotheology  by  no  means  implies  a  radical rupture or transformation of the classical philosophical project as  such.  Non-ontotheological  thinking,  they  argue,  does  not necessarily  entail  a  fundamental  overhaul  of  the  Western philosophical tradition as a whole or a hermeneutic embracement of a 'weak' thinking devoid of absoluteness and universality. They are specifically opposed to the Heideggerian finitization of  thinking,  the  roots  of  which  they  trace  back  to Kant's critical philosophy. Meillassoux, in particular, has argued  that  Kant's  'Copernican  revolution,'  with  its  shift  of philosophical  focus  to  the  correlation  between  thinking  and being  that  is  subsequently  thematized  by  Heidegger  as  a factical, context-sensitive, and historically situated process, has\n\nled to the progressive deabsolutization of thinking that Meillassoux  precisely  seeks  to  overcome  by  showing  that  it ultimately rests on an implicit absolute thesis, namely, that of absolute contingency . For both Badiou and Meillassoux, the tool required to overcome the contemporary philosophy of finitude is mathematics ,  the  ontological appropriation of which-and that of post-Cantorian set theory in particular-allows nonontotheological ontological frameworks ultimately committed to forms of materialism .\n\nIn what follows, I will briefly compare the Heideggerian hermeneutical  notion  of  post-ontotheological  thinking  to  the Badiouan  and  Meillassouxian  materialist  versions.  Such  a preliminary comparison will enable us to see how replacing the meaning-  and  language-centered  orientation  of  Heidegger's 'poetic' or 'correlationist' postmetaphysics (and, in a sense, of post-Kantian philosophy as a whole) with an approach based on the  absolute  ontological  significance  of  mathematics  and  set theory  can  also  lead  to  a  new  kind  of  rationalism  regarding philosophy's relation to divinity and the divine.\n\n## 2. Divinity without 'being': Heidegger and the ultimate god\n\nDespite its strong association  with  the  Heideggerian deconstruction of Western metaphysics, the term 'ontotheology' was not coined by Heidegger but-significantly from the point of  view  of  Meillassoux's  reading  of  Heidegger  as  a  kind  of 'ultimate Kantian'-by Kant. In the transcendental dialectic of his first Critique , Kant (1998a, 699-700 [A 631-32; B 659-60]; 1998b, 584) distinguishes two main forms of rational theology: transcendental theology (a 'deistic' approach to the deity based on the concepts of pure  reason) and  natural  theology  (a 'theistic'  approach  based  on  concepts  from  empirical  nature). Transcendental  theology  is  further  divided  into  ontotheology (based on purely conceptual arguments, e.g., that the concept of the supreme being necessarily entails its existence) and cosmotheology  (based  on  the  transcendental  implications  of  a certain type of experience, e.g., that of one's own existence); the main  types  of  natural  theology  are  physicotheology  (based  on\n\nthe observed causal order of natural things) and moral theology (based on the moral order observed in the world). Construed as attempts to prove the objective reality of God as the supreme being,  Kant  argues,  even  cosmotheology  and  physicotheology are ultimately ontotheological modes of deducing the necessary existence of a supreme being from the necessity of the concept of a supreme being. This, however, is for Kant a speculative move that  illegitimately  supposes  being  (existence)  to  be  a  'real predicate,'  an  attribute  that  adds  something  to  a  concept  and without which it would be less perfect. Transcendental theology can  therefore  only  have  a  negative  function  immanent  to reason:  it  shows  that  the  structure  of  theoretical  rationality inherently  requires  a  transcendental  ideal  of  perfection  for which an objective counterpart can never be found in experience  and  the  existence  of  which  can  therefore  never  be proven or disproven (Kant 1998a, 706-07 [A 640-41; B 668-69]; 1998b,  588).  In  his Critique  of  Practical  Reason Kant  (1996, 239-46; 2003, 167-77 [A 223-37; AA 124-32]) goes on to show that a form of moral theology, which shows the necessity of a supreme good as a practical postulate of moral agency and as an  object of  'moral  faith,'  remains  viable  and  practically necessary, but this is precisely a nononto theological approach that does not constitute a theoretical 'proof' of God's objective reality.\n\nIn the Kantian  critique of ontotheology, and  in the subsequent notion of the divinity as a regulative rational ideal to  which  it  is  illegitimate  to  attribute  being  in  the  sense  of objective  existence,  it  is  possible  to  see  a  prototype  of  the Heideggerian 'theology without 'being'.' However, the Heideggerian use of the term 'ontotheology' is much wider and has  a  broader  historical  perspective. 2   While  Kant  associates ontotheology with the use of ontological arguments for theological ends, historically associated with Scholasticism and Descartes, Heidegger employs the term to designate the use of theology for ontological purposes, a tendency paradigmatically exhibited by the basic structure of the Aristotelian Metaphysics .\n\nThe 'first philosophy' that constitutes the subject matter of  the Metaphysics is  famously characterized by Aristotle as a science of being qua being ( to on h ē on ; Metaphysics\n\nΓ .1.1003a21-32), i.e., as  a  general  ontology  of  everything  that in some sense is . The obvious problem of ontology as a science is its  extreme generality. 'Being as such' cannot function as the most  general  kind  or  genus  of  all  things  ( Β .3.998b22-27; Η .6.1045b6; Posterior Analytics II.7.92b13-14); Aristotle's theory  of  definition  precludes  the  possibility  of  one  supreme genus  that  would  comprise  everything,  since  its  subspecies could not be differentiated using meaningful criteria independent  of  the  genus  and  the  subspecies  ( Metaphysics Ζ .12.1037b29-1038a35; Topics VI.6.144a28-b11). The supreme genera are thus the different categories and modalities of being, and being as such ( to on ) is a 'transcendental' determination in the  Scholastic  sense  of  transcending  the  limits  of  even  the supreme  genera  or  kinds  of  beings  and  is  itself  without  a general  definition.  Being  is  articulated  in  several  different senses  ( to  on  legetai  pollach ō s )  that  are  not  reducible  to  any single  basic  meaning  ( Γ .2.1003a33).  Even  so,  'being'  is  not  a purely  equivocal  term;  its  many  different  senses  are  still related to a unity and to some single nature ( pros hen kai mian tina  physin ;  1003a33-34),  to  a  single  principle  ( pros  mian arch ē n ; 1003b6). Like 'being,' the term 'healthy' ( hygieinon ) is used  in  several  irreducibly  different  senses,  but  these  are  all related, albeit in different ways, to health as an ideal state of a living  body:  a  healthy  complexion  is  a sign of  health,  healthy habits are means for attaining and preserving health, and so on (1003a34-b4). In the case of being, the corresponding ideal or standard sense is ousia , 'substance' or, more broadly, 'beingness'-the mode of being of a separate, determinate, and ontologically independent particular thing (1003b6-19; Ζ .1.1028a10-b4). Ousia is the point of reference for the different senses and hierarchies of being: it is substantial being as opposed to predicable being, actuality as opposed to potency, and so on.\n\nHowever, concrete material substances involve a problematic  ontological  duality,  exposed  in Metaphysics Ζ , Η , and Θ .  On  the  one  hand,  their  beingness-that  which  makes them the determinate things they are-consists in their species-form ( eidos ), i.e., that which makes them what they are, instantiations of a specific type of thing ( Ζ .3.1029a7-30;\n\n17.1041b5-9). On the other hand, form alone does not constitute  a  concrete  spatiotemporal  thing,  a  'this';  for  this purpose,  an  additional  individuating  matter  ( hyl ē )  is  required ( Η .1.1042a24-31). Because of the matter-form twofoldness, the beingness  ( ousia )  of  concrete  material  things  cannot  be  the ultimate unifying reference point of all beings. This can only be an ideal entity, an ideal instance of ousiaperfectly simple and indivisible, perfectly actual and perfectly identical with its own essence ( Λ .1.1069a18-b2; 6.1071b2-7). This is the God ( theos ) of metaphysics,  the  absolutely  self-sufficient  'thought  thinking itself' ( no ē sis no ē se ō s )-the ultimate 'final cause' of all things, the  unmoved  mover  whose  ontological  perfection  all  material, transient, and contingent things strive to emulate (7.1072a19b30;  8.1074a33-37;  9.1074b17-1075a5).  When  the  particular structure of its subject matter is properly understood, ontology, the science of being as such, can only be realized in the form of theology, of the science of the supreme mode of being. 'General metaphysics' is implemented through a 'special metaphysics,' but  one  that  studies  precisely  the  ultimate  point  of  reference and  ideal for all beings, i.e., the perfection of  beingness ( Ε .1.1026a23-32).\n\nThis Aristotelian conflation of ontology and theology-the move  of  thinking  that  proves  the  ontological  necessity  of  a supreme being and by so doing brings ontology to its culmination-is precisely what Heidegger understands by ontotheology. He repeatedly returns to the ontologicaltheological twofoldness  of  Aristotle's  determination  of  first philosophy in his early lecture courses 3 , and summarizes it in his 1949 introduction to What Is Metaphysics? in the following way:\n\n[…]  metaphysics  represents  the  beingness  [ Seiendheit ]  of  beings  in  a twofold manner: in the first place, the totality of beings as such with an eye to their most universal traits ( on katholou, koinon ); but at the same time also the totality of beings as such in the sense of the highest and therefore divine being ( on katholou, akrotaton, theion ). In the metaphysics  of  Aristotle,  the  unconcealedness  of  beings  as  such  is specifically  developed  in  this  twofold  manner  […].  According  to  its essence, metaphysics is at the same time both ontology in the narrower sense, and theology. (Heidegger 1996, 378-79; 1998d, 287)\n\nThe term 'ontotheology' is adopted in Heidegger's 193031 course on Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit to  designate the tendency of Hegel's speculative idealism, inherited from ancient metaphysics, to orient the question of being to the divine, which Hegel grasps in terms of his speculative logic (Heidegger 1988b, 140-43;  1994b,  97-99).  The  term  is  then  used  repeatedly  in connection with Plato (Heidegger 1996, 235-36; 1998d, 180-81), Kant  (Heidegger  1996,  449;  1998d,  340),  Hegel  (Heidegger 1989, 206; 1999, 144; 2002c, 152; 2003b, 202-03; 2009, 81; 2012, 161),  Schelling  (Heidegger  1985,  51,  66;  1995b,  62,  79),  and Nietzsche  (Heidegger  1991d,  210;  1998c,  314).  Heidegger's perhaps most lucid formulation of the ontotheological mode of thought  can  be  found  in  his  1944-46  essay  on  'Nihilism  as Determined by the History of Being':\n\nOf  course,  metaphysics  acknowledges  that  beings  [ Seiendes ]  are  not without being [ Sein ]. But scarcely has it said so when it again relocates being [ Sein ] in a being [ Seiendes ] […]. The grounding of being-which has  barely  been  given  a  thought-in  the  most-being  [ Seiendsten ]  of beings  proceeds,  in  accordance  with  the  metaphysical  question,  from beings as such. […] Because metaphysics, in thinking beings as such, is approached by being but thinks it on the basis of and with reference to beings,  metaphysics  as  such  must  therefore  speak  out  ( legein )  the theion in  the  sense  of  the  supremely  being  ground.  Metaphysics  is inherently  theology.  It  is  theology  to  the  extent  that  it  speaks  out beings qua beings, on  h ē on . Ontology is simultaneously and necessarily theology. (1991d, 208-09; 1998c, 311, 312, 313; tr. mod.)\n\nOntotheology, for Heidegger, is the approach in which the basic ontological  question  concerning  being  ( Sein )  as  such-apart from  all  of  its  particular  instances,  all  individual  things  that are, beings-encounters the universality and indeterminacy of 'being  as  such'  and  theologically  resorts  to  the  supreme  and ideal instance of being, the most-being of beings, as the absolute point of reference of all beings. While ontotheological metaphysics starts from the very acknowledgement of the fact that  being  as  such  is  not  identical  with  any  particular  thing that is, it ultimately fails to think this difference between being and that-which-is in positive terms (2002c, 274-75; 2003b, 36465).  Precisely  because  of  the  fact  that  being  as  such  is  not determinable in the way specific beings are, ontotheology ends up determining being as such in terms of the supreme being. In\n\nhis  most  profound  and  demanding  discussion  of  ontotheology, The Onto-theo-logical Constitution of Metaphysics (1957), Heidegger puts this in another way: since metaphysics essentially looks at being as the ground ( Grund )  of  all  that  is, and  thinks  of  ground  in  terms  of  a  'cause'  ( Ursache )  that  is itself  something  determinate,  it  ends  up  pointing  to  God,  the supreme being, as the primal (and ultimate) final cause of  all things that is also its own cause.\n\n[…] the matter [ Sache ] of thinking is beings [ das Seiende ] as such, that is,  being  [ Sein ].  Being  shows  itself  in  the  essential  mode  of  a  ground [ Grundes ]. Accordingly, the matter of thinking, being as the ground, is thought  out  fully  only  when  the  ground  is  represented  as  the  first ground, pr ō t ē arch ē .  The original matter of thinking presents itself as the primal cause [ Ur-sache ],  the causa prima that corresponds to the establishing  [ begründenden ]  recourse  to  the ultima  ratio, the  final account [ Rechenschaft ]. The being of beings is represented fundamentally, in the sense of the ground, only as causa sui. This is the  metaphysical  concept  of  God.  Metaphysics  must  think  in  the direction of the deity because the matter of thinking is being-namely, being  as  ground,  in  diverse  ways  […].  (2002a,  51;  2002b,  59-60;  tr. mod.)\n\nIn Heidegger's historical narrative, ontotheological thinking originates with Plato, more specifically in Book VI of the Republic (508d4-509c2),  where  the  Idea  of  the  Good  is singled out as the Idea of Ideas, as the Idea of ideality as such that makes possible all the other Ideas as the ideal conceptual identities of particular things (Heidegger 1996, 235-36; 1998d, 180-81). Since its Platonic-Aristotelian inauguration, Heidegger (2002a, 45; 2002b, 54) maintains, the basic framework of the entire ancient, medieval, and modern metaphysical  tradition  up  to  Hegel  and  Nietzsche  remains ontotheological.  That  Heidegger  views  Nietzsche,  the  minister of  the  'death  of  God,'  as  a  culmination  of  ontotheological thinking  highlights  the  fact  that  his  notion  of  ontotheology  is not limited to the metaphysical models in which the metaphysical  or  Christian  God  holds  an  absolute  position. Rather,  ontotheology  stands  for  the absolutizing tendency  of Western philosophy as such, for the quest for an absolute point of reference for all things. Starting from Descartes, the Aristotelian-Neoplatonic-Scholastic  deity  gradually  surrenders its metaphysical  role to subjectivity , in the sense of the\n\nindubitably  certain  self-consciousness  of  the  thinking  ego. 4 Even Kant remains ontotheological in the Heideggerian sense: for Kant's transcendental idealism, the 'unity of transcendental apperception,' i.e., the potential association of the representation  'I  think'  with  all  other  representations  (Kant 1998a,  178-81,  215-16  [A  106-108;  B  131-136];  1998b,  24648),  holds  the  role  of  a  universal  (albeit  immanent  and  nonabsolute)  point  of  reference. 5   The  ontotheological  hierarchy implicit in Kant's critical philosophy is absolutized in speculative idealism, particularly at the end of Hegel's Science of Logic, where the Absolute Idea-the absolutely comprehensive determination-is identified with being ( Sein ) in its  dialectically  fully  unfolded  sense  (Hegel  1981,  236;  2010, 735;  Heidegger  1997b,  383-384;  2006b,  339-40;  2008b,  46). Being  as  such  and  the  supreme  instance  of  being  are  thus conflated,  and  this  is  the  first  stage  in  the  conclusion  of ontotheology, one that leaves no more conceptual leeway for the development of metaphysics in its rational-speculative form. In Heidegger's  reading,  however,  it  is  Nietzsche  who  makes  the last  move  of  modern  ontotheology  by  replacing  the  theoretical and speculative notion of subjectivity with a willing subjectivity-with a notion of subjectivity as the will to power that ultimately wills nothing exterior to itself. 6\n\nThis  narrative  provides  the  cue  for  the  key  topic  of Heidegger's  later  thinking,  the  'other  beginning'  ( der  andere Anfang )  of  Western  thought  delineated  in Contributions  to Philosophy and  related  texts. 7   Very  generally  speaking,  the other beginning would transform the first (Greek) beginning(s) of  philosophy  and  metaphysics  into  a  post-Nietzschean  and post-metaphysical approach that would renounce the quest for absoluteness altogether and hermeneutically embrace the radical finitude, historicity, and context-specificity of thinking. We  cannot  here  go into the details of this  fundamental transformation of which Heidegger produced only more or less preparatory  and  fragmentary  drafts.  However,  what  interests us  with  regard  to  our  topic  and  from  the  point  of  view  of  the reappropriation of the Heideggerian critique of ontotheology in contemporary theology, are the transformations in the notions of  the  deity  and  divinity  that  the  end  of  ontotheology  would\n\nentail. Of this, Heidegger gives us some clues. At the end of The Onto-theo-logical Constitution of  Metaphysics , he famously notes that 'the god-less thinking which must abandon the god of  philosophy,  god  as causa  sui ,  is  […]  perhaps  closer  to  the divine [ göttlichen ] god.' (Heidegger 2002a, 64-65; 2002b, 72; tr. mod.)\n\nEven though Heidegger's brief draft on the 'ultimate god' in the Contributions remains for the most part shrouded in the enigmatic postmetaphysical shorthand of the work and replete with nuances and aspects that we cannot begin to unravel here, its main outline is quite clear. 8  The ultimate god is 'completely other  to  the  previous  ones,  particularly  to  the  Christian  one' (Heidegger 1989, 403; 1999, 283; 2012, 319) and in this sense can  be  identified  with  the  'divine  god'  to  which  the  postontotheological 'god-less thinking' remains open. Whereas the Christian  God  became  interpreted  in  Aristotelian-Scholastic terms as the most-being of all beings and thus as the foundation of the hierarchical metaphysical 'system of being,' the god of the Heideggerian 'other beginning'\n\nis neither a 'being' [ seiend ] nor an 'non-being' [ unseiend ], and also not to  be  equated  with beyng [ Seyn ,  i.e.,  postmetaphysically  reconsidered being].  Rather, beyng abides  [ west ] temporally  and  spatially  as  that 'between' [ Zwischen ] that can never be grounded in god but also not in the human being as something occurring [ vorhandenes ] and living, but only  in Da-sein .  (Heidegger  1989,  263;  1999,  185-86;  2012,  207;  tr. mod.) 9\n\nWhile  ancient  and  medieval  metaphysics  situated  the Archimedean  point  of  'beings  as  a  whole'  in  God's  perfection and modern metaphysics relocated it in the immanence of the thinking  (human)  subjectivity,  Heideggerian  postmetaphysics makes both of these former points of reference interdependent dimensions or poles in a multidimensional and multipolar event of the spatiotemporal contextualization of meaningful presence, i.e.,  in  the  event  or  'taking-place'  ( Ereignis )  of  beyng  ( Seyn ). Just like the Heideggerian 'subject,' the human being who is no longer  simply  identical  with Da-sein ,  i.e.,  with  the  dynamic context or place into which beyng 'takes place,' but simply one of  its  essential  contributors  or  participants,  the  Heideggerian deity  has  become  radically  deabsolutized:  far  from  being  the\n\nparadigm of self-sufficient and substantial being, the divine is merely  one  of  the  interdependent  aspects  of  contextualized meaningfulness.  It  has  no  subsistence  outside  the  process  of contextualization but is radically dependent upon it. What is at stake in the postmetaphysical transformation is the 'recognition  of  the  belonging  of  the  human  being  to  beyng [ Seyn ]  through god, the admission [ Eingeständnis ]  by god that it needs beyng, an admission that does not relinquish god or its greatness.'  (Heidegger  1989,  413;  1999,  291;  2012,  327;  tr. mod.)  For  Heidegger,  an  important  aspect  of  the  greatness  of the postmetaphysical poet Hölderlin lies in the latter's invention, in Verse VIII of his  hymn The Rhine , of a deabsolutized divinity, of a meaning-bestowing dimension that is itself dependent on being acknowledged and received by the human being. 10\n\nArguably the most developed account of the Heideggerian postmetaphysical divinity, and one that is deeply informed by Hölderlin's language, is the late account of the fourfold ( Geviert ), in which the 'divinities' ( die Göttlichen ) figure as one of  the  four  meaning-dimensions  that  converge  in  the  singular and  situated  meaningfulness  of  a  particular  thing.  None  of these  dimensions,  including  the  divine  one,  is  independent  of their  reciprocal  intertwining  in  the  thing  as  a  focal  point  of experienced meaning (Heidegger 2000b, 172; 2001a, 177). The divinities, in the plural, are the 'beckoning [ winkenden ] envoys of  the  deity  [ Gottheit ].  From the concealed prevailing [ Walten ] of  these [divinities], god appears in its essence [ Wesen ],  which withdraws it beyond any comparison with what is present [ dem Anwesenden ].'  (2000b,  171;  2001a,  176;  tr.  mod.)  The  deity  is the dimension of ultimate purpose-it is not a present and selfsubsistent entity but rather a dimension of radical futurity that appears  and  is  encountered  through  its  different  aspects,  the divine 'indications' or 'hints' ( Winke ) of an ultimate meaning. This god 'has' no being but is a dimension of the  meaningful taking-place ( Ereignis ) of being as a divinity always yet to come , not as an eschatological future present expected or anticipated by  humans,  but  as  the  futural  dimension  of  purpose  towards which the  'futural  ones  of  the  ultimate  god'  ( die  Zukünftigen des  letzten  Gottes ;  1989,  399;  1999,  280;  2012,  316),  i.e.,  the\n\npostontotheological  'theologians,'  are  primarily  oriented  and which  in  this  sense  'awaits'  human  beings  (1989,  417;  1999, 293; 2012, 330).\n\n## 3. Against poetic theology and fideism: Badiou's contemporary atheism and Meillassoux's virtual god\n\nIn  his Briefings  on  Existence ( Court  traité  d'ontologie transitoire ,  1998), Alain Badiou presents a succinct but highly interesting  discussion  of  what  he  calls  Heidegger's  'aporia,' referring  to  the  latter's  (Heidegger  2000a,  671;  1993b,  107) famous words in his 1966 interview for Der Spiegel : 'How can it be  that  the  thinker  who  determined  metaphysics  as  ontotheology,  an  overshadowing  of  the  question  of  being  [ être ]  by that  of  the  supreme  being  [ étant ],  ends  up  saying  in  his testament  that  only  a  god  can  save  us?'  (Badiou  1998,  18; 2006a,  27-28;  tr.  mod.)  Badiou  is  well  aware  that  Heidegger has in mind a type of god that is identical neither with the God of metaphysics nor with the God of the monotheistic religions, but rather corresponds to the Hölderlinian divinity, 'the God of poets,' an ultimate source of meaningfulness, 'that from which […] there is the enchantment of the world.' (Badiou 1998, 1819;  2006a,  28)  The  passive  prospect  of  a  'divine  intervention' involves  a  poetic,  nostalgic,  and  melancholic  vision  of  a  'reenchantment'  of  the  world  through  the  emergence  of  a  new dimension of ultimate purposiveness. Thus, the (Heideggerian) 'deconstruction of metaphysics and assent given to the death of the Christian God has held the chances open for the God of the poem.' (1998, 19; 2006a, 29)\n\n'To say 'only a god can save us' means: the thinking informed by the poets […] may uphold […] the possibility, devoid of any way or means open to utterance, of a resacralization of the earth.' (1989, 32; 1999, 51; tr. mod.)\n\nFor  Badiou,  such  a  poetic  longing  for  the  arrival  of divinity-as  well  as  what  he  regards  as  Heidegger's  'poetic ontology' as a whole-cannot avoid having reactionary intellectual and political implications, as is evident, he thinks, from Heidegger's attempt at overcoming contemporary 'technical  nihilism'  and  from  his  infamous  political  error.\n\n(1989,  7-12,  33-40;  1999,  27-32,  53-60)  In  Badiou's  eyes, contemporary  'antiphilosophy,'  with  its  resigned  pessimism regarding  the  prospects  of  the  classical  philosophical  project and  of  the  progressive  enterprises  of  modernity  in  general,  is directly informed by the Heideggerian 'suturing' of philosophy to  poetry  and  by  the  associated  dream  of  a  'salvation'  in  the form of a re-enchantment by meaning of the homogenized and inherently  meaningless  contemporary  technical  reality.  (1989, 7-12, 21-26, 49-58; 1999, 27-32, 41-45, 69-77) Overcoming the late  modern  predicament  therefore  entails,  Badiou  maintains, the adoption of a 'contemporary atheism,' one that surrenders not only the ontotheological divinity but the poetic one as well. (1998, 20; 2006, 29) A key point in this approach is the attack on  the  central  topic  of  Heidegger's  thinking: finitude ,  which Badiou  sees  as  a  part  of  contemporary  philosophy's  Kantian legacy. 11\n\nThat  our  exposure  to  being  is  essentially  finite  and  that  we  must forever  return  to  our  mortal-being,  is  the  fact  from  which  we  endure the  living  God's  death  only  to  uphold,  under  multiple  shapes,  the indistinct  promise  of  a  sense  that  has  withdrawn,  but  whose  'comeback'  has  not  been  debarred.  […]  It  is  thus  imperative,  so  as  to  be serenely  established  in  the  irreversible  element  of  God's  death,  to finish up with the motif of finitude. […] the aim is to finish up with the motif  of  finitude  and  its  hermeneutical  escort.  (Badiou  1998,  20,  21; 2006a, 29, 30; tr. mod.)\n\nThe method for achieving this break with the Heideggerian  hermeneutics  of  finitude  is  famously  discovered by Badiou in mathematics-more specifically, in post-Cantorian set  theory,  with  its  revolutionary  new  way  of  mathematizing the infinite in the form of different infinite multiplicities with different cardinalities. The key ontological import of set theory is, for Badiou, its ability to dissociate the notion of infinity from the  metaphysical  notion  of  an  ultimate  and  supreme unity of being, of an ultimate and absolute point of reference that would unify all finite and determinate things-in Aristotle's Metaphysics ,  the  metaphysical God. From the recognition that all  beings  cannot  be  brought  under  one  univocal  concept  or 'set'-i.e., that there can be no 'universal set,' that the totality of  beings  is  an inconsistent multiplicity  in  Cantor's  sense (Badiou  1988,  53;  2005,  41)-Aristotle  deduced  that  ontology\n\nmust  take  recourse  in  the  supreme  being  as  the  absolutely universal  reference  point,  'infinite'  in  the  sense  that  it  is beyond  any  material  and  spatiotemporal  specificity. 12   This  is precisely how Badiou defines ontotheology in his magnum opus , Being  and  Event , the main  exposition  of  his equation  of ontology  with  mathematics:  ontotheology  is  the  metaphysical approach  'for  which  the  absolute  is  thought  as  a  supreme infinite  being,  thus  as  transmathematical,  in-numerable,  as  a form of the one so radical that no multiple can consist therein.' (1988,  53;  2005,  42;  cf.  1988,  161-62;  2005,  142-43)  Against ontotheology,  Badiou  posits  his  mathematical,  set-theoretical ontology,  which  accepts  only  consistent  multiplicities-ones that  can  be  treated  as  sets-and  for  which  an  inconsistent multiplicity  simply is not ,  is non-being .  In  other  words,  for mathematical ontology, the one , in the sense of an ultimate and absolute unity, is not . (1988, 53-54; 2005, 42)\n\nThis  is  the  foundational  'decision'  of  Badiou's  ontology, which he considers to be a break with the history of ontotheological  metaphysics:  there  is  no  unity  or  totality  of being,  no  Archimedean  point  for  everything.  Rather,  being  as such is pure, inconsistent multiplicity that resists all unification  (1988,  33,  550,  555;  2005,  25,  511,  519).  Unity pertains  only  to particular instances  or  'presentations'  of being-'situations' or 'worlds'-which are consistent multiplicities  based  on  a  unifying,  structuring  operation  of 'count-as-one' that determines what, in each particular situation,  is  to  be  counted  as a being.  (1988,  31-39,  104-05, 539, 557; 2005, 23-30, 90, 504, 522) Being as such, that which is fundamentally presented in all structured situations of being, is  beyond  consistent  multiplicities  and  the  unities  they  are composed of; it 'is' a multiplicity only in retrospect, in the sense of  'not-one,' of being beyond the structured sets that ontology operates with. For Badiou, such an ontology also constitutes a break  with  Heideggerian  post-ontotheological  hermeneutics, which  still  looks  if  not  to  an  ultimate  unity,  at  least  to  an ultimate dimension of sense and purpose inherent in being as the taking-place of finite and situated meaningfulness. Heidegger's 'poetic' ontology is still preoccupied with what has always been the focal topic of metaphysics: being as meaningful\n\npresence or intelligibility, which accordingly sees ontology as a study of meaning (1988, 16; 2005 9-10). In its Badiouan sense as  the  inconsistent  multiplicity  that  precedes  all  structured consistency, being is the inherently meaning less ,  homogenous, undifferentiated,  and  inarticulate  'raw  material'  of  situations or worlds. As Badiou points out in a 1997 interview with Peter Hallward, this can be rendered as a fundamentally materialist approach:  ''Matter'  would  simply  be,  immediately  after  being, the  most  general  possible  name  of  the  presented  (of  'what  is presented').  […]  I  am  a  materialist  in  the  sense  that  I  think that any presentation is material.' (Badiou 2001, 130) Such a mathematical, materialist ontology invites us to restitute  the  infinite  to  the  banality  of  manifold-being  […].  […]  the destiny of every situation is the infinite manifold of sets. Depth cannot ever develop there, and the homogeneity of the manifold ontologically prevails over the play of intensities. […] the search for sense is reduced for us to the sole numbering of this infinity […]. (Badiou 1998, 21-22; 2006, 30)\n\nOne of  the  central  accomplishments  of  this  model  is,  for Badiou,  that  it  makes any notion  of  divinity  superfluous.  It confirms the 'death,' proclaimed by Nietzsche, of the Christian God; by abandoning the notion of ultimate unity, it dispenses with the need for the ontotheological God of metaphysics; and thirdly,  it  also  makes  the  Heideggerian  post-ontotheological divinity,  the  'God  of  poetry'  unnecessary  by  adopting  a  basic 'nihilism' in the sense of an understanding of being as such as inherently  meaning less .  What  Badiou  shares  with  his  great contemporary  Deleuze  is  a  commitment  to  a  fundamental immanence ,  divested  of  all  references  to  transcendence,  either ontotheologically or hermeneutically conceived. 13  'Committed to the  triple  destitution  of  the  gods,  we  […]  can  assert  that everything is here, always here, and that thought's reserve lies in  the  thoroughly  informed  and  firmly  declared  egalitarian platitude of what befalls upon us here.' (Badiou 1998, 23; 2006, 31)  The  sole  dimension  of  purpose  lies  within  the  subjective truth-processes-politics, art, science, and love-that indefinitely  reconfigure  the  world  of  immanence  in  terms  of  a potentially  transformative  historical  event;  thus,  for  Badiou (1997;  2003),  even  the  apostle  Paul  becomes  a  pre-eminently\n\npolitical figure,  faithfully  committed  to  the  revolutionizing event of Christ's death. 14\n\nIn his breakthrough work After Finitude: An Essay on the Necessity of Contingency ( Après la finitude: essai sur la nécessité de la contingence , 2006), Quentin  Meillassoux  adopts  the essential  core  of  the  Badiouan  understanding  of  ontotheology and  of the problematic consequences  of  the  Heideggerian attempt at overcoming it. As is announced by its title, the book is essentially aimed at uncovering the inner inconsistencies and philosophical  limitations  of  the  Kantian  topic  of  the  inherent finitude of  thinking  and  its  hermeneutical  developments  and variations.  Meillassoux's  argumentation  is  informed  by  his brilliant analysis of what he sees as the dominant framework of Western philosophy as a whole since Kant: correlationism ,  the approach that sets out from the philosophical irreducibility of the  correlation  between  being  and  thinking  (in  the  widest possible sense that comprises knowledge, experience, consciousness, discourse, language, and willing) and maintains that  being  and  thinking  are  inconceivable  apart  from  one another (Meillassoux 2006a, 18-23; 2008a, 5-9). In addition to Kantian transcendental idealism ('weak correlationism'), which  retains  the  necessity  of  an  absolute  (but  unknowable) level  of  'things  in  themselves'  beyond  the  domain  of  the transcendental  structures  of  the  correlation-and  was  later converted  by  Fichte,  Schelling,  and  Hegel  into  an  absolute idealism that denies the intelligibility  of  things  in  themselves and absolutizes the correlation itself-the correlationist framework  also  comprises  the  Heideggerian  hermeneutics  of finitude ('strong correlationism'), which denies the intelligibility  of  things  in  themselves  but  also  promotes  the radical facticity (i.e.,  non-absoluteness, matter-of-factness, lack of absolute justification) of the correlation, thus denying thinking access to any kind of absolute. (Meillassoux 2006a, 4260; 2008a, 30-43)\n\nThrough a highly original and intricate chain of argumentation Meillassoux (2006a, 69-109; 2008a, 50-81) concludes, however, that in order to truly distinguish itself from absolute  idealism  and  to  avoid  internal  contradiction,  strong correlationism must ultimately absolutize its principle of\n\nfacticity-i.e., maintain that an absolute entity or level of being is not only inconceivable and unthinkable but in fact absolutely impossible , thus  turning  the  principle  of  facticity into  an absolute principle of contingency . All experienced things, all the structures of experiences, as well as experience as such , i.e., the prevailing of the correlation itself , are not only given to thinking  as  mere  facts  without  any  visible  absolute  logical necessity,  but  indeed absolutely unfounded,  unnecessary,  and contingent facts. But if this is the case, the strong correlationist deabsolutization of thinking has ultimately failed: it is compelled to retain a 'minimal absoluteness,' i.e., the absolute validity of  the non-absoluteness of  all  things  as  such.  It  is necessary that nothing -no  thing or event, not even the happening of the correlation between being and thinking, i.e., the  taking-place  of  meaningful  presenceis  necessary .  As  is shown  especially by Heidegger's 'transcendentalization' of mortality,  of the  experience  of  the  'possibility of  its  own impossibility'  as  the  ultimate  possibility  of Dasein (Heidegger 2001b, 260-267, 316-323; 2010, 249-255, 302-309), the absence of the correlation-and, thus, a reality without thinking-is absolutely conceivable. But if this is accepted, the correlationist framework bursts apart and strong correlationism is converted into what Meillassoux (2006a, 168; 2008a, 121) terms  a speculative  materialism : an  absolute certainty of the thinkability of being-without-thinking. 15 However,  the  thinking  that  can  think  this  reality  beyond meaningful presence can obviously no longer assume the form of  a  phenomenology  or  hermeneutics  of  sense  and  meaning. Following  Badiou,  Meillassoux  (2006a,  37,  176-77;  2008a,  26, 127-28) claims that it can operate only in terms of mathematics . Mathematics, and set theory in particular, is the formal method of thinking a reality independent of thinking.\n\nMeillassoux's  speculative  philosophy  is  a  genuine system in the sense that it professes to deduce all of its elements from its fundamental principle, namely, that of absolute contingency. Even the absolute bearing of mathematics is to be thus derived, although Meillassoux has thus far postponed this derivation to forthcoming works (2006a, 152-53; 2008a, 110-11). Meillassoux's refutation of ontotheology is as such not directly\n\nbased on the acceptance of a mathematical ontology, but is an independent direct consequence of the principle of contingency. By absolutizing facticity, we obtain the thesis that it is absolutely necessary that every being [ étant ] might not exist. This is indeed a speculative thesis, since we are thinking an absolute, but it is  not  metaphysical,  since  we  are  not  thinking  any thing (any  being) that would be absolute. The absolute is the absolute impossibility of a necessary being. (2006a, 82; 2008a, 60; tr. mod.)\n\nWe see from this dissociation of speculative thinking (one that claims access to some form of absolute) and metaphysical thinking (one that claims access to some form of absolute being ) that Meillassoux understands  'metaphysics'  in a strongly Heideggerian sense, one that coincides with 'ontotheology,' i.e., with the positing of a 'supreme being' as an absolute point of reference for all things. Meillassoux, too, thus subscribes to the diagnosis of the end of metaphysics. Like Badiou, however, he disagrees with the specific postmetaphysical prospects of Heideggerian hermeneutics. Meillassoux's specific point of contention with Heidegger is the latter's notion that renouncing ontotheological absolutes inevitably means renouncing all philosophical absolutes. After  Finitude aims  to  show  that  'not all  speculation  is  metaphysical,  and  not  every  absolute  is dogmatic-it is possible to envisage an absolutizing [ absolutoire ] thought that would not be absolutist .' (2006a, 47; 2008a,  34)  What  Meillassoux  explicitly  commits  himself  to  is the  critique  of  the  'de-absolutizing  implication',  according  to which  'if  metaphysics  is  obsolete,  so  is  the  absolute.'  (2006a, 47; 2008a, 34) While his argument against total deabsolutization is that it is ultimately a self-defeating intellectual  project  that  cannot  avoid  recourse  to  an  absolute principle,  his  basic motivation for  attacking  it  is,  as  with Badiou, related to the theological implications of Heideggerian post-ontotheology.  While  the  hermeneutical  deconstruction  of ontotheology  will  undermine  previously  established  forms  of rational theology, Meillassoux maintains that this deconstruction  has  simultaneously  opened  the  door  to  purely faith -based  and  'irrational'  versions  of  religiosity  Meillassoux designates as fideism .\n\n[…]  by  destroying  metaphysics  […]  one  has  inadvertently justified  belief's  claim  to  be  the  only  means  of  access  to  the absolute.  […]  the  de-absolutization  of  thought  boils  down  to the  mobilization  of  a fideist argument;  but  a  fideism  that  is 'fundamental''  rather  than  merely  'historical''  in  naturethat is to say, a fideism that has become thought's defence of religiosity  in  general,  rather  than  of  a  specific  religion  […]. The contemporary end of metaphysics is an end which, being sceptical, could only be a religious end of metaphysics. (2006a, 63-64; 2008a, 45-46.)\n\nAs  the  two  most  prominent  representatives  of  a  fideist 'aspiration  towards  an  absoluteness  which  would  no  longer retain  anything  metaphysical,  and  which  one  is  generally careful to designate by another name,' Meillassoux (2006a, 6667; 2008a, 48) cites the evocation of the 'mystical' in Wittgenstein's Tractatus as well as Heidegger's  idea  of  a 'theology  without  'being'.'  As  Wittgenstein  and  Heidegger  are for  him  also  the  central  thinkers  of  strong  correlationism (2006a,  56-57;  2008a,  41-42),  he  concludes  that  'fideism  is merely the other name for strong correlationism.' This is one of the  most  problematic  claims  of  Meillassoux's After  Finitude . One cannot help wondering what really justifies the use of the term 'absolute' in connection with these two approaches which, as  Meillassoux  himself  points  out,  precisely  avoid  presenting divinity as an 'absolute' in the traditional sense of something radically self-sufficient and self-subsistent. Moreover, the applicability  of  the  term  'fideism'  to  the  late  Heidegger's 'theological'  sketches,  in  which  the  postmetaphysical  relation to the divinity or divinities is precisely not described in terms of faith, is highly questionable, as is Meillassoux's interpretation according  to  which  Heidegger  planned  a  theology  that  should contain  'nothing  philosophical.'  However,  his  general  idea according  to  which  conceiving  God  not  as  an  entity  but  as  a dimension  of  transcendence  that  resists  objectification  makes not  only  rational  theology  but  also  the  rational a theology superfluous, seems more defensible. Wittgenstein and Heidegger  indeed  seem  to  render  discussions  concerning  the existence and non-existence of the deity as well as its modalities (necessity, possibility, contingency) effectively meaningless.\n\nIt is important to see that while Meillassoux's underlying philosophical project is essentially directed against the 'theological  turn'  in  post-Heideggerian  phenomenology  and hermeneutics, it is not the program of Badiou's 'contemporary atheism'  that  he  is  implementing,  but  something  even  more novel and unexpected, namely, the reintroduction of an explicitly philosophical notion of God as a being/entity, but one that  is  no  longer  the  ontotheological necessary being  but  a merely possible and contingent one. Even though the definitive form  of  his  relevant  work  remains  unpublished,  Meillassoux has already announced a forthcoming, completely reworked and extended  version  of  his  1997  doctoral  dissertation  on  'divine inexistence' ( L'inexistence divine ; 2006a, 67n1; 2008a, 132n15). On  the  basis  of  his  dissertation  (significant  excerpts  of  its revised version have been published in an English translation in Graham Harman's study on Meillassoux; Harman 2011, 175238), of an independently published article (Meillassoux 2006b; 2008b),  and  of  certain  hints  present  in  his  recently  published reading of Mallarmé (2011a; 2012), we already have an inkling of  the  direction  in  which  Meillassoux  is  taking  us. 16   By  all accounts,  it  seems  he  is  developing  a  notion  of  a  God-entity that,  as  a  matter  of  fact,  does not exist,  but  in  which  it  is nevertheless rationally legitimate to place one's faith since-in accordance with the principle of radical contingency-it can be, just as well as anything else. This divinity is not to be confused with the 'God who may be' of Richard Kearney's (2001; 2002) deeply Heideggerian account; the latter is articulated in terms of pure potentiality ( dynamis ) as a divinity whose presence will not assume the form of the actuality of a substance, but consists in a mere futural indication or reference. Meillassoux's 'God to come' is rather 'possible' in the Deleuzian sense of virtuality , i.e., a possibility that is in no way foreshadowed or implied by what precedes it, but can only emerge ex nihilo , as an absolute novelty , compared by Meillassoux to the emergence of life from the world of matter and to the emergence of thought from the world of biological life  (Harman 2011, 175-93). 17  In a striking speculative  retake  of  Kantian  moral  theology,  Meillassoux emphasizes  the  ethical  importance  of  a  hope,  without  any supporting  'evidence'  but  formally  legitimized  by  speculative\n\nmaterialism,  of  the  emergence  a  radically  novel  divine  entity that  would  redeem  the  traditional  promises  of  the  moral divinity-the  enactment  of  a  supreme  good  and  of  a  supreme justice for the dead and the living-in a way that does not give rise  to  the  immense  traditional  problem  of  theodicy,  since  the attributes of this entity no longer include absolute eternity and necessity  (Meillassoux  2006b;  2008b;  Harman  2011,  187-93, 207-21).\n\nIn conclusion, we may say that the contemporary philosophical overcoming of ontotheology, for which the divinity is  an always already present (actual and substantial, absolute and necessary) entity, has left us with the fundamental figure of  a  non-present  and  purely futural god.  The  hermeneutical approach basically insisted on conceiving this god-to-come as a dimension  of  purely  potential  futurity,  as  an  ultimate  sensegranting  purpose  whose  sole  form  of  presence  is  that  of  an indication,  hint,  or  trace  pointing  to  a  fundamental absence . However, the recent speculative developments of contemporary materialism have, rather surprisingly, resuscitated a genuinely messianic  notion  of  a  divine  'advent,'  of  the  possible  cominginto-presence of the divine in a purely contingent and virtual, unmotivated  and  unpredictable,  but  nonetheless  concrete  and intratemporal, event, which nevertheless can bestow a purpose and  dimension  to  the  present  situation  in  the  form  of  an unfounded but rationally legitimate  hope.  It  is  to  be  expected that  Meillassoux's  forthcoming  works  and  their  philosophical reception  will  determine  whether  the  'strong  correlationist' phase  in  philosophical  approaches  to  theology  is  truly  giving way to a new, non-ontotheological rationalism.\n\n## NOTES\n\n1 In  his  Zürich  seminar,  Heidegger  (2005,  436-37)  replies  to  a  question concerning  the  identity  of  being  and  God:  'Being  [ Sein ]  and  god  are  not identical,  and  I  would  never  attempt  to  think  the  essence  [ Wesen ]  of  god through being. […] Were I yet to write a theology, as I am sometimes tempted to  do,  the  word  'being'  should  not  occur  in  it.  […]  I  believe  that  being  can never be thought as the ground and essence of god, but that the experience of god and its  manifestness (insofar as it is encountered by the human being)\n\nnonetheless takes place [ sich ereignet ]  in the direction of being, which never means that being could be a possible predicate of god.' That Heidegger makes this statement in 1951 implies that he does not yet qualify the draft on the 'ultimate  god'  in Contributions  to  Philosophy as  a  'theology'  in  the  strict sense.\n\n- 2 Among the most elaborate and thorough discussions of Heidegger's notion of ontotheology are Thomson 2005 and 2010.\n- 3 See, e.g., Heidegger 1983, 65-67; 1988a, 29; 1990, 17; 1992b, 14; 1993a, 206, 286, 307; 1995a, 42-44; 1997a, 37-38; 2006a, 60-61; 2008a, 168, 215, 227.\n- 4 On this reading of Descartes, see, e.g., Heidegger 1989, 212-13; 1996, 42930; 1998b, 112-71, 391-97, 410-13; 1998d, 325; 1999, 148-49; 2000b, 69-72, 82-83; 2002c, 66, 74-76, 81-84; 2003a, 87-88, 98-99; 2003b, 87, 98-100, 10611; 2012, 166-67.\n- 5 On the unity of transcendental apperception in Kant, see Heidegger 1988a, 125-29,  142-47;  1996,  458-63;  1997a,  177-182,  201-209;  1997c,  55-59; 1998a, 78-84; 1998c, 419-420; 1998d, 347-50; 2003a, 57-58.\n- 6 On this reading of Nietzsche, see, e.g., Heidegger 1991a, 3-6; 1991b, 198208; 1991c, 3-9, 150-251; 1991d, 147-96; 1998b, 1-4, 415-32, 585-94; 1998c, 1-22,  177-229,  231-361;  2000b,  77-86,  97-122;  2002c,  157-99;  2003a,  93102; 2003b, 209-67.\n- 7 On the  'other  onset,'  see,  e.g.,  Heidegger  1989,  4-6,  55,  57-60,  167-224; 1992a, 124-25, 184-90; 1994a, 108-09, 158-66; 1999, 3-5, 38, 40-42, 117-57; 2012, 6-8, 44, 46-48, 133-77.\n- 8 For one of the most illuminating discussions of the Heideggerian 'ultimate god,' see Greisch 2000; 2008.\n- 9 I adopt here the rendering of Seyn as 'beyng,' employed in the more recent Rojcewicz-Vallega-Neu translation of Contributions (instead of 'be-ing' in the Emad-Maly translation) . The Early Modern English orthography 'beyng' has the  advantage  of  being  functionally  similar,  as  an  archaic  and  obsolete spelling of 'being,' to the German Seyn (still in use in the early 19 th  century).\n- 10 In Verse VIII of The Rhine ,  Hölderlin  (1951,  152)  writes:  '[…]  if  there  is anything / that the celestial ones require [ bedürfen ], / it is heroes and humans / and other mortals. For since / the most blissful ones [ Seligsten ] feel nothing by themselves, / there must […] be another who partakes / in the names of the gods and feels. / That is the one they need [ brauchen ] [...].' Heidegger (1980, 269) comments: 'With this Verse VIII the poet's thinking ascends one of the most protruding and solitary peaks of Western thinking, and that is to say, at the same time: of beyng [ Seyns ].'\n- 11 In his Logics of Worlds (2006), Badiou provocatively maintains that '[t]he critical machinery he [Kant] set up has enduringly poisoned philosophy […]. Kant is  the  inventor  of  the  disastrous  theme  of  our  'finitude'  […].'  (Badiou 2006b, 561; 2009, 535)\n- 12 This is the sense in which infinity is attributed to God by Thomas Aquinas ( Summa theologiae Ia q7 a1).\n\n13 Beistegui (2005, 45) aptly summarizes Badiou's philosophical project as an attempt  to  free  thought  from  the  double  horizon  of  unicity  (ontology)  and transcendence (theology).\n\n- 14 On  the  ambiguities  inherent  in  Badiou's  relationship  to  theology,  see Clemens  and  Roffe  2008;  Depoortere  2009;  Phelps  2013.  One  of  the  only studies  that  also  discusses  Meillassoux's  relationship  to  theology  is  Watkin 2011.\n- 15 On Meillassoux's 'argument from mortality,' see my article 'Transcendental  Idealism  and  Strong  Correlationism:  Meillassoux  and  the End  of  Heideggerian  Finitude,'  forthcoming  in Phenomenology  and  the Transcendental , edited by Sara Heinämaa, Mirja Hartimo, and Timo Miettinen (London: Routledge).\n- 16 For some of the few existing commentaries on Meillassoux's notion of the divine, see Harman 2011, 90-122; Johnston 2011; Watkin 2011, 132-67.\n- 17 On  the  distinction  between  potentiality  and  virtuality,  see  Meillassoux 2006c; 2011b.\n\n## REFERENCES\n\nAristotle.  1924.
