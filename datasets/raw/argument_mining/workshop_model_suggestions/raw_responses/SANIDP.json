Cajetan  argues that the soul's immortality can indeed be demonstrated by philosophical arguments and is thus not a question of faith alone 1 .  He concludes harshly that only a very\n\n* This article is a substantially revised version of a talk delivered at the University of Olomouc in 2013. I thank Paul Richard Blum and Tomáš Nejeschleba for their invitation to Olomouc. I thank Cristiano Casalini for his invitation to publish the talk and Yannick Beilke for his linguistic revision of the article.\n\n1 Cfr. T. Cajetan, Opuscula omnia: in tres tomos digesta , Lyon, 1588, f. 187b: «Quas ob res si animi nostri (de quo agimus) facultas certi  aliquid  componere  potest,  et  veritatis  quippiam  de  seipso  perspicere,  si  fortissimis  argumentis  fides  ulla  adhibenda  est,  si  ratione investigata et ad sensuum usque explorationem deducta humanae sententiae  quietem  tribuunt  ineruditi,  indocilis,  tardi,  hebetis  stupidique est immortalitatem animorum in problema revocare neutrum. O quam sibi  melius  consulerent  isti  qui  se  rerum  occultarum  scrutatores profitentes, quae natura in sole exposuit, offundunt atque obtegunt, si suam  caecitatem  silentio  opprimerent:  meliores  namque  haberentur philosophi dum tacerent, quam imperitores dum tam inepte garriunt». On Cajetan's view on the immortality and how he changed his opin-\n\npoor or dumb mind would call the question of the soul's immortality a 'neutral problem' ( problema neutrum ), i.e. a question where both opposing positions were equally defendable. Scholars unable to prove the immortal intellect  philosophically  are  considered  better  philosophers as long they keep silent on the matter instead of talking nonsense. Hence, for the Cajetan of 1503 it is equally  inappropriate  to  cast  doubt  on  the  soul's  immortality as it is to claim the mortality of the soul. Ten years later it was the next pope's decree to clarify the issue. The Fifth Council of the Lateran, summoned by Julius II but continued after his death in February 1513 by Leo X, addressed the issue of the immortality of the human soul at the council's eighth session in December  1513 2 .  Cajetan  was  a  member  of  the  council  as well 3 .\n\nThe papal bull Apostolici  regiminis ,  the  outcome of this session, is commonly regarded as a decree defining the immortality of the human soul as a dogma of the  church.  However,  Eric  A.  Constant  has  argued convincingly that the bull, reacting to certain habits of philosophical disputation and teaching in Italy, was not a  «dogmatic  declaration  on  immortality,  but  rather  a ion, cfr. K. L. Schmitz, Problem of the Immortality of the Human Soul in the Works of Cajetan (1469-1534) , Toronto, University of Toronto (PhD diss.), 1953, pp. 277-315; B. Hallensleben, Communicatio: Anthropologie  und  Gnadenlehre  bei  Thomas  de  Vio  Cajetan, Münster, Aschendorffsche Verlagsbuchhandlung, 1985, pp. 187-204.\n\n3 On  Cajetan's  role,  cfr.  E.  A.  Constant,  «A  Reinterpretation» cit. , pp. 374-375.\n\n2 Cfr.  N.H. Minnich, «Julius II and Leo X as Presidents of the Fifth  Lateran  Council»,  in  F.  Alazard  -  F.  La  Brasca  (eds.), La  papauté à la Renaissance , Paris, H. Champion, 2007, pp. 153-166; E. A. Constant, A Reinterpretation of the Fifth Lateran Council Decree Apostolici  Regiminis  (1513) ,  in  «The  Sixteenth  Century  Journal»,  XXXIII (2002), 2, pp. 353-379.\n\ndogmatic condemnation of the so-called doctrine of the double  truth» 4 .  The anthropological question  of  the human soul might have provoked the decree as it was a major controversial subject, but the actual line of battle was  formed  somewhere  else.  The  bull  aimed  at  condemning  the epistemic position  that  philosophical  arguments are unable to prove a doctrine of faith, or, as the  notion  of  the  double  truth  is  suggesting,  that  philosophy renders its own co-existing truth, which is in contradiction with the truth of faith. Against the background of the institutional practice of Renaissance university  learning,  the  condemnation  meant  to  prevent the  case  that  a  philosophy  professor  argued  for  the mortality of the soul while a theologian argued for its immortality.\n\nWithin the framework of university education this condemnation required a specific pedagogy of the philosophy course in order to assure consensus among the two faculties of arts and theology regarding matters of orthodoxy and piety. The Society of Jesus, a catholic order founded in 1540 and loyal to the pope, devoted itself  to  the  education of young men ad maiorem Dei gloriam and hence was dedicated to developing a study programme  that  effectively  ensured  a  philosophical education as the best possible preparation for the study of catholic theology. This article will present the case study of the Jesuit college in Rome, whose earliest educational designer, Diego de Ledesma, developed pedagogical  guidelines,  which  put  into  practice  what  the Lateran  Council  had  prescribed.  Of  course  it  was  an important  concern  of  Jesuit  philosophy  to  prove  the\n\nimmortality of the soul 5 ;  however, this article will focus  on  the  epistemic  aspect  of  the  bull,  i.e.  the  condemnation of the double truth. I will argue that this aspect had an impact on general guidelines of the Jesuit practice  of  philosophy  teaching,  mainly,  though,  not only  with  regard  to  philosophical  psychology.  I  will proceed  in  four  steps:  First,  the  bull's  content  and background will be sketched as far as necessary for my argument.  Next,  the  bull's  impact  on  Jesuit  official documents  such  as  the Ratio  studiorum will  be  outlined  briefly.  In  a  third  step,  I  will  show  how  Ledesma's pedagogical guidelines  and  measures  reflect  the bull's  condemnation  of  double  truth.  In  a  conclusive step  I  will  elucidate  how  Ledesma's  efforts  were  implemented in the printed commentary on De anima by his Roman colleague Franciscus Toletus.\n\n- I. What does the bull of 1513 say about philosophical tenets  and  philosophical  disputations?  The  bull  consists  of  two  parts:  a doctrinal part,  and  a disciplinary\n\n5 For  Jesuit  discussions  of  the  immortality,  cfr.  H.

The  doctrinal  part  has  two  concerns.  First,  the bull condemns «all those who insist that the intellectual soul is mortal, or that it is one among all human beings,  and  those  who  suggest  doubts  on  this  topic» 7 . Three positions are attacked. The Averroist doctrine of the unity of the intellect, the doctrine of a mortal, material  intellect  mostly  pinned  on Alexander of Aphrodisias and a sceptic position 8 . The very decree, i.e. the formal declaration of a dogma, was the second concern of the bull's doctrinal part. It reads as follows:\n\nSince  truth  cannot  contradict  truth,  we  define  that  every statement contrary to the enlightened truth of the faith is totally  false  and  we  strictly  forbid  teaching  otherwise  to  be permitted.\n\nIn the first instance, the decree does not concern the question, whether the soul is immortal or not. Rather, the bull  addresses  the  truth  value  of  certain  claims  contradicting catholic faith, which are «totally false», since the existence  of  two  truths  was  considered  a  self-contradiction.\n\nThe second part of the bull is concerned with some institutional consequences of what had been decreed:\n\n6 I follow Constant's reading of the bull, cfr. above n. 2.\n\n- 8 For a synopsis of opinions, cfr.

I follow his translation in all quotes taken from the document.\n\nMoreover we strictly enjoin on […] every philosopher who teaches publicly […] that when they explain […] the principles or conclusions of philosophers, where these are known to  deviate  from  the  true  faith  -  as  in  the  assertion  of  the soul's  mortality  or  of  there  being  only  one  soul  or  of  the eternity of the world and other topics of this kind - they are obliged to devote their every effort to clarify for their listeners the truth of the Christian religion, to teach it by convincing arguments, so far as this is possible, and to apply themselves  to  the  full  extent  of  their  energies  to  refuting  and disposing of the philosophers' opposing arguments, since all the solutions are available.\n\nIn  his  sermon  of  1503,  Cajetan  did  argue  for  the immortality of the soul on philosophical grounds, but strongly advised philosophers that it is more appropriate to keep silent on the issue instead of arguing otherwise  or  calling  it  a problema neutrum .  The  bull  on the other hand did not consider silence to be a reasonable option  and  thus  decreed  that  in  «topics  of  this  kind» ( alia hiusmodi ) the pious doctrine has to be taught «by convincing  arguments»  ( manifestum  facere ).  It  is  no wonder,  then,  that  Cajetan  voted  -  unsuccessfully  against this institutional part of the bull at the council 9 .\n\nHowever,  it  is  noteworthy  that  the  bull  does  not only mention questions of the soul but also the matter of the eternity of the world and even admits alia hiusmodi .  The  question  of  the  eternity  of  the  world  had been the standard example of a problema neutrum for Aristotelian  philosophers,  i.e.  a  question  where  both sides can be defended 10 : the creation account of the Bi-\n\n- 9 Cfr.  above  n.  1  and  3  and  J.

Philosophers such as Pietro Pomponazzi already argued that the matter of the immortality of the soul is of the same nature, namely the  true  answer  is  revealed  by  Scripture  -  and  philosophical arguments alone cannot decide the matter 11 .\n\nThe  question  remains  how  to  deal  with  such stalemate situations in university disputations. The earliest statutes (issued before 1490) of the University of Freiburg  in  Germany  for  example  already  prescribe that when a student in his exam is asked about a question like the eternity of the world, he is to defend the position of the Christian faith and shall try to refute the reasons  against  this  position 12 .

This was  taken  up  as  the  bull's  academic  imperative:  In matters contradicting faith, the Christian position is the true one and has to be defended in school disputations and the false position has to be refuted.\n\nII. How is the influence of the Council of the Lateran to be traced in official Jesuits documents of the time? A very short history might run as follows: Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of the Society, only defined in the constitutions of the order that philosophy should follow the doctrine of Aristotle 13 .  Loyola's confrère Hieronymus Nadal commented on that brief passage explaining  that  Aristotle  only  should  be  followed  where  his doctrine does not deviate from the doctrine of faith and the  Saints 14 .

Nadal's  comment  already  was  reflected  in  the first draft of a Ratio studiorum for Jesuit schools, written between 1565 and 1570 15 . The Ratio of 1586 elaborated on a passage from the Jesuits' Constitutions that all  philosophy teachers should also be educated theologians, since otherwise they might not be able to refute the arguments of the infidels as the Lateran Council advised 16 .\n\nDetermining the role of the Jesuit philosophy professor the Ratio of 1591 (and 1599) decrees the following:\n\n[The professor of philosophy] shall not depart from Aristotle, unless he finds some doctrine contrary to the common teaching of the schools or, more serious still, contrary to the true faith. If he does find such contrary doctrines in Aristotle or any other philosopher, he shall be at pains thoroughly to refute them as the Lateran Council prescribes 17 .\n\ndoctrina non discedunt; quae vero discedunt, iuxta canonem Concilii Lateranensis sub Leone decimo ea refellere ac reiicere oportebit».\n\n16 Cfr. MPSI V, 101: «Nam si theologi non fuerint, minus erunt tuti in concludendo, in probando, in loquendo, aetatis minus maturae, doctrinae parum uberis, vix dissolvere poterunt argumenta infidelium iuxta decretum concilii lateranensis, neque ita philosophiam pertractabunt, ut theologiae deserviat».\n\n15 Cfr.

Farrell  (ed.), The  Jesuit  Ratio  Studiorum  of 1599 ,  Washington,  D.C.,  Conference  of  Major  Superiors  of  Jesuits,\n\nThese programmatic directives clearly reflect the academic imperative of the bull. In this key passage defining the duty of philosophy professors in official Jesuit documents the papal decree of 1513 served as a crucial legitimation for promoting Christian doctrines already in the philosophy curriculum. But such a brief history falls  short  of  revealing  how  these  prescriptions  were actually implemented in classes.\n\nIII. How did the Jesuit teaching meet the requirements of the Lateran Council? In order to answer this question  with  a  concrete  and  illustrative  example,  I  will present  one  aspect  of  Diego  de  Ledesma's  pedagogy for  the Collegio  Romano .  Ledesma  (1519-1575)  was the third Prefect of Studies at the Roman College between 1562 and 1575, being responsible to coordinate and supervise the studies  at  one  college 18 .  He  experienced the first educational crisis of his Jesuit college in 1564  and  immediately  identified  several  reasons  for  it. He  relates  that  in  Italy  experience  has  shown  that  too much  liberty  in  teaching  philosophy  is  harmful  to  the faith. Instead, philosophy should serve theology 19 .

MPSI II, 478: «Item, sic doceatur philosophia, ut serviat theologiae; et ideo notentur opiniones non tenendae in his quae fidem concernunt, ac eae quae sunt defendendae, ut omnes sic doceant et to-\n\n18 For an overview of Ledesma's work as pedagogue, cfr.

Belmonte, To  Give  Ornament,  Splendor  and  Perfection:  Diego  de Ledesma  and  Sixteenth  Century  Jesuit  Educational  Administration , Chicago,  Loyola  University  Chicago  (PhD  diss.),  2006.  However, Belmonte does not focus on censorship.\n\nhad happened? In Ledesma's eyes a colleague named Benito Perera was to blame 20 . Perera was very popular among  his  students,  but  Ledesma  observed  that  his students  adopted  some  dangerous  philosophical  positions.  According  to  Ledesma,  he  was  told  by  Perera that  it  was  not  necessary  to  refute  arguments  against the faith and that natural reason cannot demonstrate the soul's immortality 21 . These pernicious claims out of the Jesuits' own ranks were conceived as a scandal and led Ledesma to  radical  measures.  He  first  made  a  list  of dangerous  teachings  circulating  among  Perera's  students. Most of them concerned the epistemic aspect of double  truth,  namely  the  sceptic  position  that  certain doctrines  of  faith  cannot  be  known  or  cannot  be solved. Then he compiled two similar lists of affirmative teachings that were to be defended.\n\nHe  decided,  together  with  the  Jesuits'  Superior General  Francis  Borgia  that  a  similar  list  should  be sent to every college. They thought it would guarantee for the unity and the safety of doctrine 22 . They included tius  viribus  defendant,  et  ad  id  obligentur  expresse,  etiam  secundum Aristotelem, ut de immortalitatae animae etc.; ac per totam Societatem sic servetur».\n\n21 Cfr. MPSI II, 502: «Non esse necesse solvere rationes factas contra fidem; sed neque oportere his fidem confirmare, imo derogari fidei,  si  quis  conetur  rationibus  luminis  naturalis  eam  fulcire.  Hanc sextam, partim in classe mihi respondit, et partim ex discipulis accepi».\n\n20 On  Perera's  standing  among his Jesuit colleagues, cfr. P. R. Blum, Studies on Early Modern Aristotelianism ,  Leiden, Brill, 2012, pp. 141-147. I give a more detailed account in my article The Debate between  Diego  de  Ledesma  and  Benet  Perera  about  the  Philosophy Course at the Collegio Romano ,  forthcoming 2014 in a special issue of «Quaestio», edited by M. Lamanna.\n\n22 On Jesuit censorship, cfr. above n. 13 and U. G. Leinsle, «Delectus  opinionum.  Traditionsbildung  durch  Auswahl  in  der  frühen Jesuitentheologie»,  in  G.  Schmuttermayr  -  W.  Beinert  -  H.  Petri (eds.), Im Spannungsfeld von Tradition und Innovation: Festschrift für\n\nfive general remarks, chose 17 particular propositions and issued the list as Decretum Borgianum in the same year 23 .  The  first  general  remark  advises  that  nothing shall  be  taught  in  philosophy  or  theology  which  is against  the  faith,  derogates  the  faith  or  even  favours the faith to a lesser degree ( nihil defendatur, vel doceatur quod adversetur vel deroget vel minus fidei faveat ). Among the propositions to be taught it is stated that the intellective soul is immortal according to Aristotle and the  true  philosophy ( anima intellectiva est immortalis secundum Aristotelem et veram philosophiam ).\n\nIt  is  noteworthy  that  these  propositions  are  not condemnations. Ledesma did not primarily aim at prohibiting a harmful doctrine, but at prescribing the pious doctrine. Some of the propositions on the list also have a negative, condemning part, but always an affirmative part  follows  with  an  adversative  «not  this,  but  that». Furthermore , Ledesma did not only speak about a doctrine in accordance with the true philosophy, but he also pinned the true doctrine on Aristotle. The writings of Aristotle were, as we have seen, the basis of teaching philosophy at a Jesuit College. Hence, Ledesma insisted, whenever possible, on emphasizing that Aristotle was in line with Christian faith.\n\nJoseph Kardinal Ratzinger , Regensburg, Pustet, 1997, pp. 159-175; D. A. Bartlett, The Evolution of the Philosophical and Theological Elements of the Jesuit Ratio Studiorum: An Historical Study, 1540-1599 , San Francisco, University of San Francisco (PhD diss.), 1988.\n\n23 Cfr.  MPSI  III,  383-385.  On  its  impact,  cfr.  U.  G.  Leinsle, «Delectus  opinionum»  cit.,  p.  161.  Considering  Ledesma  to  be  the ghost-writer of the decree is confirmed by MPSI III, 384, n. 2. In the critical  edition  the  decree  only  counts  16  propositions;  however,  the 17 th is a variant available in one manuscript, cfr. MPSI III, 385 (apparatus). It seems reasonable to follow this manuscript, since early Jesuits (like Ledesma, Bellarmin etc.) counted 17 propositions and, hence, obviously relied on this source, cfr. MPSI* 567; MPSI VI, 5.\n\nFortunately, Ledesma not only left behind his lists but  he  also  commented  on  the Decretum  Borgianum several  years  later  and  explained  his  opinion  on  the matter of the freedom of opinion to the Jesuit Superior General Everard Mercurian in 1574 24 . Especially these two sources can be read as programmatic manifestos of his pedagogical beliefs and allow tackling the question of  how  philosophy  ought  to  be  taught  according  to Ledesma.  By  looking  at  these  documents  it  becomes clear, what role the Lateran Council played within his concept of schooling.\n\nIn annotations to the first Ratio studiorum of 1565 Ledesma records his contention that it is not sufficient just to give very general guidelines 25 . What was really needed in pedagogy were detailed and elaborate concepts. He compares his position to that of an architect: An architect cannot just say that a building should be bright,  high  and  ornate,  but  he  has  to  give  very  concrete instructions: The foundation has to be of specific dimension, the gate ought to have a particular height, the  windows  also  ought  to  have  a  certain  height  and  so on 26 . The decree of the Lateran Council served Ledesma in two ways to give these concrete instructions for teaching philosophy.\n\n24 Ledesma's  commentary  on  the Decretum  Borgianum is  not contained in the MPSI hence I rely on the older edition, cfr. MPSI* 548-569. The letter to Mercurian is edited in MPSI IV, 196-204.\n\n26 Cfr. MPSI II, 688.\n\n25 Cfr. MPSI II, 687: «Arbitror enim non esse satis in universum et  generatim ordinem et rationem studiorem perscribere, sed particulatim  oportere  per  singulas  classes  et  singula  earum  exercitationum genera, modum et rationem optimam magistro servandam explicare». This  document  relates  to  the  teaching  of  humanities  only,  however, applying his conclusions to the philosophy course as well seems justified to me.\n\nThe  first  way  concerns  the anthropological dimension  of  the  bull,  i.e.  the  condemnation  of  certain heterodox positions about the human soul. He wrote a long  commentary  on  the Decretum  Borgianum in which he discusses each of the prescribed propositions trying to prove their individual accordance with catholic  faith.  For  this  purpose,  he  compiled florilegia of passages  from  scripture,  cited  councils  of  the  church and collected auctoritates of Aristotle and of the medieval  commentators.  All  of  them  serve  to  proof  that  a particular prescribed doctrine in question is in accordance with faith and common philosophy. Accordingly the bull of 1513 served as chief witness with regard to doctrines of Christian philosophy of the soul.\n\nLedesma's second use of the bull concerns its disciplinary part. For Ledesma, the freedom of opinion is comparable to the freedom of religion. And, of course, he is not in favour of that, he even considers the plea for  such  freedom  as  a  sign  for  living  in  a  heretical era 27 .  In his opinion the curiosity of philosophy teachers should be limited; rather they are to follow a bright light  on  their  way.  Censorship  ensuring  the  unity  of doctrine is seen as a fence to guide the teacher on his way, so that he cannot be seduced - due to man's corrupt nature - by his curiosity to take a wrong turn 28 . To justify  this  belief,  Ledesma  twice  quotes  the  discipli-\n\n27 Cfr. MPSI IV, 199: «Item, libertas doctrinae et praesertim in eisquae ad fidem aliquo modo concernunt aut iuvant aut nocent, esset maxima pernicies, non solum in Societate, sed etiam in Dei Ecclesia. Quae sane petitio libertatis doctrinae et eius permissio in suo gradu (si qui id petunt) similis est petitioni ac permissioni libertatis religionis et fidei; quam hodie tanto conatu, petunt nostrae aetatis haeretici».\n\n28 Cfr.  MPSI IV, 200: «Praeterea magistri ipsi habebunt lucem quam sequantur, et viam ac scopulos cognitos quos caveant. Et peregrina ac curiosa ingenia, si quae fuerint (quae nunquam desunt, ut est haec nostra natura corrupta), in officio continebuntur et intra cancellos».\n\nnary part of the bull: The truth of the faith ought to be taught and everything opposed to it ought to be refuted 29 .\n\nSo far the bull justifies two imperatives for Ledesma, namely that certain positions concerning the human soul are sacrosanct and that it is the papal will to promote these positions against the heretics. But it is of particular interest how Ledesma intended to achieve these two educational goals. This concerns the question of  how  exactly  the  heretic  doctrines  have  to  be  refuted and of how the faithful position is to be promoted. Finally,  it  addresses  the  methodological  question  of  how  a teacher in doubtful cases can be able to decide which position he should defend.\n\nLedesma repeats very often, that it is not enough just to show the falsity of a position but it needs to be necessary to state, what the true position is 30 . Thus, his list  of  propositions  contains  affirmative  prescriptions, not  only  negative  prohibitions.  He  argues,  that  with these prescriptions a teacher cannot subscribe to a less pious or heretical position due to ignorance, knowledge, will, error, deception or insanity 31 . He then gives  a  few  examples:  If  he  had  only  condemned  the\n\n29 Cfr. MPSI IV, 199 and 201: «Denique concilium lateranense sub Leone X, sessione 8, praecipit aliqua in particulari, et in aliis iubet ut conentur magistri rationibus et def[endere] pro viribus et solvendo rationes contrarias etc. […] Haec quae constituta sunt, bona ex parte sunt ea quae in concilio lateranensi sub Leone X, sessione 8 expresse ponuntur».\n\n31 Cfr.  MPSI IV, 204: «Quare compluribus prohibitionibus hoc modo negative nunquam satis esset.  Oportet  ergo,  ut  factum  fuit  ob hanc ipsam causam, tunc etiam praevisam eum illa fuerunt constituta, ut opinio magis pia affirmative docenda proponatur, ne possit effugere quis ad aliquid minus pium aut impium ex ignorantia aut scientia, voluntate, errore, dolo vel malitia».\n\n30 Cfr. MPSI IV, 203: «Respondemus non esse satis ut negative tantum hae propositiones proponantur et mutentur ex affirmativis; ut nunc sunt in negativas».\n\nview that man has three souls, a teacher might respond: «I  do  not  teach  that  man  has  three  souls,  but  I  teach that he has only two», or he could say, «I do not teach that there are several rational souls in a man» 32 . These somewhat childish and yet abundant examples clearly reflect what he considered to be very real problems in class.  In  fact,  there  are  many  passages  in  Aristotle where  his  readers  cannot  be  completely  sure  about what  is  actually  meant.  Ledesma  instead  wanted  to avoid  any  hermeneutical  doubts  in  crucial  cases 33 .  In his  lists  of  propositions  he  mostly  identified  the  true position with that of Aristotle. In doing so he aimed to avoid the following 34 : a teacher might claim, «I am not\n\n32 Cfr. MPSI IV, 204: «Nam ita nunquam satis cautum esset, et facile possent eludi, ut v. g. si proponatur sic: Nullus doceat esse tres animas  in  homine  secundum  philosophiam  aut  Aristotelem;  diceret aliquis: ego non doceo tres esse animas, sed tantum duas, scilicet intellectivam et sensitivam, in homine, vel sensitivam et vegetativam in bruto; vel diceret: ego non doceo esse plures animas rationales in homine».\n\n34 Cfr.  MPSI*  568-569:  «Nec  illa  vox  affirmativa,  secundum Aristotelem,  mutanda  negative,  scilicet,  non  doceatur  contrarium secundum Aristotelem […] non est, inquam, mutanda in negativam, nam ita, ut alias diximus de ipsismet propositionibus, non esset sufficienter cautum 1° Quia v. g. magister doceret Aristotelem esse dubium in his, et se excusaret, dicens: Ego non doceo contrarium esse verum secundum Aristotelem, sed illum esse dubium in hac re. 2° Vel doceret in Aristotele haec esse problemata, et diceret: Ego non dico Aristotelem  sic  sentire,  sed  esse  problema  in  Aristotele,  et  esse  utrumque probabile.  [...]  4°  Etiamsi  in  his  rebus  tanti  momenti  immortalitatis animae,  etc.,  taceret  omnino  et  nil  diceret  quid  sentiat  Aristoteles, quod tamen dissimulare vix aut ne vix quidem posset, tamen haec ipsa taciturnitas in talibus ac tantis rebus suspicionem et notam generaret in discipulis ipsum contrarium sentire. Nec vero expedit talem taciturnitatis licentiam concedere in his rebus maximi momenti; imo vero discipuli haud dubie magistrum interrogabunt quid in ea re sentiat Aristo-\n\n33 On  the  'ambiguities  in  Aristotle'  for  early-modern  philosophers, cfr. H. Wels, «Die 'Doppelte Wahrheit'», cit.\n\nin  doubt  about  this  problem,  but  Aristotle  is».  He might  say  that  «this  is  a  problem  in  Aristotle  where both positions are defendable». For Ledesma even silence  about  these  exegetical  problems  was  no  option. Leaving  out  these  questions  would  only  make  pupils curious,  he  remarked.  They  might  become  suspicious and  ask  their  teacher,  who  then  would  not  be  readily prepared  to  solve  the  problem.  Ledesma  thus  tried  to dismiss those readings of Aristotle, which might clash with catholic faith. Finally, his aim was not a general guidance  of  'how  to  read  Aristotle',  but  to  carefully avoid the notion of double truth in matters crucial for faith.\n\nLedesma therefore established the following rule: if  in  doubt  about  opposing  positions,  always  choose the most pious one! In dubio pro fide . He had first established  this  rule  in  1564,  but  only  for  theologians reading Thomas Aquinas 35 .  The Decretum Borgianum started  with  the  general  remark  that  nothing  shall  be taught which is against faith and years later he justified this remark again, stating that to follow this rule is the duty of men according to natural law 36 . And if we give teles, et facile eius animum deprehendent, etc. Quare numquam esset satis cautum negative (et non doceatur contrarium per Aristotelem)».\n\n36 Cfr. MPSI* 548-549: «Sed haec particula tam est pia, tam iusta et tam sancta, ut id sit iure naturae divino et humano debitum; et e contra,  si  detur  licentia  aut  permittatur  ut  ea  doceantur,  quae  minus fidei favent, quid inde boni futurum speramus, et non potius plurimum mali,  enervando  sanctam  fidem  ex  parte,  et  obstacula  quaedam  ei ponendo talium opinionum, male cum fide aut minus consentientium? et  lumen  naturae  ostendendo,  si  non  omnino  fidei  contrarium,  at  ex parte ei adversum et male consonum? Ac pluribus id quidem ostenderem, nisi res esset per se tam pia et tam manifesta, et contraria tam nociva  et  impia.  Atque  omnes  rationes,  quas  pro  opinionibus  vetitis  in\n\n35 Cfr. MPSI II, 500: «Item, ea semper sequatur in dubiis et ambiguis opinionibus, quae magis videntur conducere ad fidem».\n\nthe permission to do otherwise, what are we to expect from the future? Certainly nothing good. Ledesma here argues in the framework of moral theology. Since thirteenth-century Canon Law the so-called regula magistralis advised always to choose the safer, i.e. the more pious  opinion  ( in  dubiis  tutior  pars  est  eligenda )  in matters of doubt 37 . This of course is a purely theological and ethical argument, but it reveals, how seriously Ledesma  took  his  pedagogical  guidelines.  Teaching something  as  a  true  or  probable  position,  which  contradicts  faith,  he  considered  a  sin.  To  always  choose the position, which is in line with faith, then was also the most pious option.\n\nIV. Did Ledesma's assertive contentions have any impact  on  the  philosophy  of  the  Jesuits?  The Decretum Borgianum was  not  accepted  in  all  Jesuit  colleges 38 . However, its impact can easily be traced by presenting the  example  of  Franciscus  Toletus'  commentary  on Aristotle's De anima 39 .\n\nSocietate  alias  attulimus,  idem  probant;  atque  ideo  de  his  in  genere plura non dicimus».\n\n- 38 Cfr. above n. 23.\n\n37 For an overview on concepts of probability in moral theology and  the regula  magistralis ,  cfr.  R.  Schüssler,  «On  the  Anatomy  of Probabilism», in J. Kraye - R. Saarinen (eds.), Moral Philosophy on the Threshold of Modernity ,  Dordrecht, Kluwer Academic, 2005, pp. 153-154.  The  relation  between  censorship,  moral  theology  and  law remains to be investigated.\n\n39 As a starting point cfr. S. Salatowsky, De Anima: die Rezeption der aristotelischen Psychologie im 16. und 17. Jahrhundert , Amsterdam,  B.R.  Grüner,  2006,  140-150;  E.  Kessler,  «The  Intellective Soul», in C. Schmitt - Q. Skinner - J. Kraye (eds.), The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1988, pp. 511-512.\n\nDe anima was the central work with regard to the doctrines  on  the  human  soul  and  can  thus  be  considered a matter of delicacy. In 1575, Franciscus Toletus was  the  first  Jesuit  whose  commentary  on De  anima was printed, and Diego de Ledesma was one of the two censors  of  the  edition 40 .  Ledesma  and  Toletus  were colleagues at the Roman College and taught theology together 41 . So, it is not surprising that the commentary opens  with  several  pages  presenting  ten  propositions that  philosophy  needs  to  adhere  to 42 .  These  propositions are more or less what Ledesma had issued years ago.  Toletus,  too,  justifies  his  preamble  by  citing  a passage from the decree of the Lateran Council 43 .  The tenth and last proposition states that all natural reasons, which could be delivered against the immortality of the soul, are sophistic, vain and refutable 44 . Then, he quotes\n\n- 40 Cfr.  F.  Toletus, Commentaria una cum quaestionibus in tres libros Aristotelis de anima , Venice, 1575, f. 183v.\n- 42 Cfr. F. Toletus, Commentaria cit., ff. 6v-8r, entitled «Propositiones  aliquot  Fide  tenendae,  quibus  vera  debet  esse  Philosophia consentanea».\n- 41 Cfr. H. Nadal, Epistolae P. Hieronymi Nadal ab anno 1546 ad 1577 , vol. 2 (1562-1565) , Madrid, A. Avrial, 1899, p. 442.\n- 43 Cfr. Ibid. ,  f.  6v:  «Quia  multa  de  Anima  disputanda  sunt,  in quibus non licet Catholico dubitare, disputantur autem, ut philosophorum errores et sophismata vitentur et reiiciantur, ac vera philosophia constet; placuit antequam quicquam disputaretur, ea omnia, ut fundamenta certa proponere, ut postea securius et ex peditius procedamus, nec hoc est a nobis hoc loco praeter rationem factum. Nam Concilio Lateranenis tertio congregatio sub Leone X anno 1513 sessio 8 impositum est».\n\n44 Cfr. Ibid. ,  f.  8r:  «Decima.  Omnes  rationes  naturales,  quae contra  animae  immortalitatem  et  alias  veritates  Fidei  a  Philosophis factae fuerunt, sunt sophisticae et vanae et solubiles. Nec enim philosophia vera repugnat veritati divinae. Haec est contra aliquos, qui absque ulla consideratione dicunt, secundum philosophiam esse animam mortalem et in aliis huiusmodi hoc inepto et impio utuntur loquendi modo, quos damnat Concilium Lateranensis allegatum sub Leone X\n\nthe  bull  again,  namely  that  truth  cannot  contradict truth. However, Toletus went beyond this quotation by framing its metaphysical justification in his  own words:  Faith  is  above  nature  and  not  against  it  and hence  the  Council  demanded  to  solve  any  contradictions  and  to  teach  the  truth.  The  whole  introductory text seems to be completely in the spirit of Ledesma's guidelines.\n\nToletus's  commentary on De anima proceeds,  as Ledesma would approve: Toletus not only shows that the catholic position is in line with the true philosophy but  also  with  Aristotle  himself 45 .  The  name  of  Pomponazzi  never  comes  up  in  Ledesma's  writings,  but Toletus explicitly attacks him concerning the question on the immortality:\n\nTherefore Pomponazzi erred when he said that according to philosophy the soul is mortal; but maybe he was not wrong to say that the immortality of the soul cannot be proved by natural reason. Duns Scotus also holds the same opinion although such a claim seems to be a reckless statement after the Councils of Vienne and the Lateran. Nonetheless it is an error to say that it is against philosophy or that it is not in accordance with philosophy 46 .\n\nsessio 8 et determinat, quae fidei repugnant, non esse secundum philosophiam vera. Verum enim non contradicit vero. Est autem fides supra naturam, non autem contra ipsam et iubet Concilium et solvi et veritatem pro viribus quantum fieri possit, persuadere et docere».\n\n46 Cfr. Ibid. ,  f.  148v:  «Unde  erravit  Pomponatius  dicens,  animam mortalem secundum philosophiam; et quamvis non esset fortasse error, dicere, quod non potest demonstrari naturaliter animae immortalitas; hoc enim dicit Scotus 4. Sent. d. 43 q. 2, quamquam et hoc ip-\n\n45 Cfr. Ibid. , f. 148v: «At veritas Catholica et fides determinavit omnia ista tria coniugenda: est enim anima forma immortalis et multiplicata  secundum  individua  et  hoc  idem  ut  ostendimus,  sensit  et  asseruit Aristoteles. Simul etiam determinatum est secundum Fidem, ut diximus I. de anima, quod ista non repugant rationi naturali et verae philosophiae».\n\nToletus  agrees,  though  hesitatingly,  with  Pomponazzi  that  the  immortality  of  the  soul  cannot  be demonstrated by natural reason. Very likely, Ledesma would  not  have  endorsed  this  concession.  However, Toletus  seems  to  suggest  that  this  contested  teaching had become a dangerous matter only after the Council of Vienne in 1311 and the bull of 1513 47 . Toletus also takes up what Ledesma had argued before him asking rhetorically 48 :  Why  would  anyone  decide  to  defend  a position  against  the  faith?  If  anyone  claimed  that  the soul is  mortal  and  errs  -  they  will  be  tortured  in  hell for  this  lapse.  But  if  anyone  claimed  that  the  soul  is immortal and it turns out to be wrong - it would have no consequences 49 . Nothing seems to be more rational than to hold the immortality of the soul on philosophical grounds.\n\nsum, post Concililium Viennense et Lateranense sub Leone X. videtur dictum temerarium, sed tamen error iste est, dicere, esse contra philosophiam, aut non esse secundum philosophiam».\n\n48 Cfr. Ibid. ,  f.  155r:  «Ex maiori utilitate, securitate et decentia huius opinionis, quam contrariae. Tandem melius est et tutius, sic opinari pro nobis quam contra nos ipsos. Nam aut haec fides et opinio vera est, scilicet animam esse immortalem et tunc quidem, si quis eam non crediderit aut credere enoluerit, post mortem luet poenas et feret supplicum; id quod non putat et quod oportuisset in hac vita praecavere. Aut non est vera opinio animam scilicet esse immortalem et tunc nihil  erit  periculi  post  mortem,  sic  fuisse  opinatos  in  vita,  quia  cum anima post ea non maneat, redargui non poterimus de ea re neque puniri ob id».\n\n47 On  Vienne's  impact  on  psychology,  cfr.  A  Baldissera,  «La decisione del concilio di Vienne (1311) 'Substantia animae rationalis seu intellectivae vere ac per se humani corporis forma' nell'interpretazione di un contemporaneo», in «Rivista di filosofia neo-scolastica», XXXIV (1942), pp. 212-32.\n\n49 Kessler calls this argument «prefiguring Pascal's famous wager», cfr. E. Kessler, «The Intellective Soul», cit., p. 512.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs a Prefect of Studies at the Roman College, Diego  de  Ledesma  designed  a  full-fledged  concept  of teaching. His efforts were partly directed against scandals  that  happened  in  his  own  house.  These  troubles basically concerned doctrines which were condemned at  the  Lateran  Council.  To  build  a  stronghold  against these dangerous trends, Ledesma reflected both on the content and the method of teaching. He compiled lists of  propositions  that  teachers  were  to  defend  in  their classes.  He  gave  more  general  guidelines  how  they should be taught. The papal bull of 1513 played a significant role in justifying and provoking these measures.  The  bull  had  condemned  what  Ledesma came to condemn: heterodox doctrines on the human soul. The bull had decreed that whatever is against the truth  of  the  faith  is  totally  false.  Ledesma  had  implemented  his  method  of  teaching  designed  as  to  avoid draw games of truth between Scripture and Aristotle. Ledesma established, as it were, a rule for pedagogical cases  of  conscience addressing philosophy teachers: always  teach  the  pious  position  by  philosophical  arguments and refute your adversaries! As a side effect, he had a significant  share  in  identifying  the  doctrines  of Aristotle  with  those  of  Christian  faith.  The  bull  had demanded  that  university  practice  was  to  meet  these requirements of faithful philosophy. Ledesma not only installed his pedagogical program in his college but also advocated that his model should serve as a blueprint for  all  colleges  of  the  Society.  And  in  fact,  it  had  a considerable impact on the De anima commentary by Franciscus Toletus and partially lived on in the Ratio studiorum of 1599 until the 18 th century.\n\n## Bibliography\n\nBelmonte, J.
