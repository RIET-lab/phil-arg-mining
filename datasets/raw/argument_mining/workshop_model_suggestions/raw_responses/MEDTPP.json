These debates often resulted in heated arguments and, at times, ad hominem attacks among disputants. As a result of their intensity, the debates have become known collectively as Òthe polemic.Ó\n\nI  am  arguing  for  two  main  theses.  First,  that  the  polemic,  rather  than  being motivated by  an emancipatory  sense of  patriotism seeking independence from Spain, was  primarily,  although  not  exclusively,  motivated  by  philosophical  and  pedagogical concerns about the impact of modern philosophy and modern science in Cuba. Second, that  by  raising  the  specter  of  patriotism in  some  of  the  debates,  JosŽ  de  la  Luz  y Caballero,  a  leading  participant  in  the  polemic,  tries  to  condition  public  debate  by attempting  to  disqualify  the  views  of  those  whom  he  viewed  as  being  insufficiently patriotic.  In  so  doing,  he  unwittingly established  a  dangerous  precedent  for  selfappointed guardians of patriotism to condition public debates.\n\nThe  polemic,  which  is barely  known  in Anglophone  culture,  was an important public display of philosophical acumen on the reception of modern philosophy in Cuba. From  May 1838  to  October 1840,  issues  of metaphysics,  epistemology, ethics, pedagogy, and the influence of Victor CousinÕs eclecticism in the practice of philosophy in Cuba were discussed in the islandÕs leading newspapers.[1] In the capital,  Havana, most debates were published in Diario de la Habana , Noticioso y Lucero , and El Plantel ; in Puerto Principe in Gaceta de Puerto Principe ; in Matanzas in La Aurora de Matanzas , and  in  Trinidad  in Correo  de  Trinidad .[2]  The  debates were so contentious that  they soon  reverberated  to  rural  places,  such  as  the  villa  of  Sant'sima  Trinidad,  where  a controversy ensued about establishing a teaching position in philosophy and choosing a suitable text for it.[3]\n\nThe  polemic  consists  of  about  one  hundred  seventy-five  mainly  newspaper articles,  some  of  which  are substantive  in length.  In  addition,  the polemic  culminated with  JosŽ  de  la  Luz  y  CaballeroÕs  unfinished  essay,  ÒImpugnaci-n  a  las  Doctrinas Filos-ficas de Victor CousinÓ [Impugnation to Victor CousinÕs Philosophical Doctrines], which  is  about  one  hundred  thirty  pages  long.[4]  As  one  scholar  underscores,  the polemic shows a rather conspicuous interest of the educated public in the island that for two years sustained an atypical interest in these debates.[5]\n\nBy following the above-mentioned debates, the educated public was kept abreast of innovative  developments  in  European  philosophy, especially in  Francophone philosophy,  whose  leading  exponent  in  Cuba  was  Victor  Cousin.  Thus,  CousinÕs eclecticism imbued most of the important arguments animating the polemic.\n\nVictor  Cousin  (1792-1867)  was an  influential French philosopher  at  the ƒcole Normale in Paris who  expounded  studies in  the  history  of  philosophy,  philosophy  of history,  and  German  idealism.  In  addition,  he acquired an international  reputation  for translating  ProclusÕs  and  PlatoÕs  works  and  editing  the  works  of  Descartes.  As  an\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nappointed minister of public instruction in 1840, during the July  Monarchy, he advocated secularism  and  nonsectarianism  as  a  way of reforming  primary and  secondary education to promote national unity.[6]\n\nCousin was also known for his modern conception of eclecticism. Like classical eclecticism,  his  modern  eclecticism  was,  to  a  large  extent,  a  reaction  against  the scholastic  appeal  to magister  dixit .  He  borrowed  ideas  from  different  philosophical systems and, hence, learned from different philosophers to try to create his own system. [7]  He also urged reconciliation of opposites not only  in philosophy  but also in politics. That  is,  he  tried  to  accomplish  the juste-milieu or  golden  mean  in  philosophy  and politics.[8]\n\nTrying to accomplish the juste-milieu in  France during the July  Monarchy  might have been commendable, but trying to do the same in Cuba during the 1830s would have been considered seditious. Since 1825, the captain general of Cuba appointed by Spain was granted Òfacultades omn'modasÓ or despotic power.[9] Henceforth, the island was virtually  under  martial  law  for  the  next  fifty  years.  So  for  Luz  y  Caballero,  the exercise of such despotic power that privileges the Spanish oligarchy in the island over the white Creole elite was a humiliating experience.\n\nThat might partly  explain Luz  y  CaballeroÕs concern about CousinÕs influence on the  Cuban  youth.  He  worried  that  those  who  have  been  influenced  by  CousinÕs eclecticism  in  philosophy might  adopt  the  same  spirit of reconciliation  in  politics becoming acquiescent to, rather than critical of, the prevalent  Spanish despotism and the widespread practice of slavery.[10]\n\nContrary  to Luz y CaballeroÕs concerns about the detrimental effects of CousinÕs eclecticism, some prominent South American scholars, such as AndrŽs Bello and Juan Bautista Alberdi, welcomed it as a way of combating the old scholasticism in support of modern philosophy  and modern science. Bello was a leading 19th-century  Venezuelan polymath    as well as a prestigious pedagogue, philosopher,  and diplomat.[11] Alberdi was  a  prominent  19th-century  Argentine  political  philosopher  and  diplomat.[12]  In addition to Bello and Alberdi, other reputable Latin American philosophers and scholars also  embraced  CousinÕs  eclecticism.[13]  So  it  seems  that,  depending  on  contextual considerations, CousinÕs eclecticism was thought either to be helpful for transforming or preserving the status quo .\n\nIn Cuba, JosŽ de la Luz y Caballero (1800-1862) impugned CousinÕs eclecticism on philosophical and political grounds.  Echoing HegelÕs criticism of  eclecticism,  Luz  y Caballero argued that  CousinÕs eclecticism is just  incoherent  because Cousin tried to reconcile that which is irreconcilable, such as materialism and idealism. In addition, he alleged that  CousinÕs eclecticism is just  politics camouflaged as philosophy  because, presumably, it countenances rather than criticizes the status quo .\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI  can adduce several reasons for this project.  First, the polemic is an important philosophical  and,  hence,  cultural  event  in  Cuba  that  has  been  virtually  ignored  in Anglophone philosophy. Second, the polemic has been misconstrued by scholars on the right  and  the  left  as  having  been  motivated  by  a  widespread  Cuban  desire  for independence from Spain.\n\nThird, the attempts by some of the leading participants in the polemic, especially JosŽ de  la  Luz  y  Caballero,  occasionally  to    justify  their  philosophical  arguments by appealing  to  patriotism  or argumentum  ad  amorem  patriae can  be  interpreted  as  a prototype of  the fallacy  of appeal to the people or argumentum ad populum .  Such an appeal can also be interpreted as a tacit ad hominem argument, whereby the intentions of those who are viewed as insufficiently patriotic are suspect.\n\nAnd fourth, the appeal to the patriotism fallacy has been and still is being used to curtail  the  freedom  of  philosophical  speculation  and  political  freedoms  in  countries around  the  world.  Hence, exploring  the  polemic  in  Cuba  is  not just an  exotic philosophical  exercise, or  a  futile  logomachy,  but one  that  might have  practical implications by alerting people to be vigilant and critical about similar restrictions in the practice of professional philosophy and enjoyment of political freedoms elsewhere.\n\nI  explore the importance of this project in four parts. In the first part, I  present a brief historical exposition for understanding some of the issues leading to the polemic. I underscore  the pivotal  role that  JosŽ Agust'n Caballero (1762-1835),  uncle  of  Luz  y Caballero,  played in reforming the teaching and practice of philosophy  in Cuba at  the end  of  the  18th  Century  and  the  early  part  of  the  19th  Century.  Yet  FŽlix  Varela  y Morales  (1788-1853),  a  former  student  of  Caballero,  challenged  the  scholasticism taught at the Royal and Pontifical University of Saint Jerome of Havana founded in 1728 (henceforth,  University of Havana).  The  historical  exposition  will  show  that  early arguments on the impact  of  modern philosophy  in  Cuba  were mainly  disagreements about the nature of philosophy, the role of theology in philosophical argumentation, and the  attempt  to  overcome  scholasticism  in  favor  of  modern  philosophy  and  modern science.\n\nIn  the  second  part,  I  explore  fundamentally  contested  issues  animating  the polemic:  on  methodology,  morality,  and  CousinÕs  eclecticism.  None  of  the  issues debated focused on patriotism per se . Sometimes, however, Luz y Caballero appeals to patriotism to try  to disqualify his opponents. I argue that such appeals are fallacious by allowing concerns about patriotism to eclipse substantive philosophical arguments.\n\nIn the third part, I argue that the predominant view of the polemic as motivated by a widespread Cuban desire for  independence from Spain promotes an emancipatory myth.  Such a predominant  view of the polemic is anachronistic and hence one-sided, consisting either  in a straw man fallacy  or  a false dilemma.  Lastly,  I  argue that Luz  y CaballeroÕs appeal to patriotism during the polemic  unwittingly  provided  a  dangerous precedent for self-appointed guardians of patriotism to condition public debates.\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n## I Historical Background\n\nThe  polemic  transpired  at  a  time  of  intellectual  curiosity  and  animadversions regarding SpainÕs role in the islandÕs affairs. This was also a time of political oppression. The captain general  appointed by  Spain had enjoyed  despotic  power  in  Cuba.  Such despotic  power  was used intermittently  depending on  the perceived  or  real threat  of sedition  by  groups  disaffected  with  SpainÕs  policies  towards  its  colony,  especially members of the white Creole elites, free people of color, and slaves who repudiated the perpetuation and expansion of slavery.[14]\n\nPrior  to  1825, Juan JosŽ D'as de Espada y  Fern‡ndez  de Landa (1756-1832), who was appointed Bishop of Havana in 1802, had welcomed the teaching of modern philosophy and  modern  science  at  the  San  Carlos  and  San  Ambrosio  Seminary (henceforth, San Carlos Seminary).[15] Nonetheless, the priest JosŽ Agust'n Caballero, in  his Philosophia  Electiva (1797),  circumspectly  introduced  modern  philosophy  and modern science  into  the  curriculum of  the  University  of  Havana and  the  San  Carlos Seminary where he taught theology and philosophy.[16]\n\nCaballeroÕs Philosophia  Electiva retains  the  preeminence  of theology over philosophy.  So  he  cautiously  engaged  the  works  of  modern  philosophers  such  as Descartes,  Spinoza,  and  Malebranche.  As  Mestre  indicates,  Caballero  expounded DescartesÕ philosophical ideas, whose name was barely known in Cuba at that time.[17]\n\nAnother  diocesan  priest,  namely  FŽlix  Varela  y  Morales,  truly  reformed  the teaching of  philosophy  and natural sciences in Cuba in the light of modern philosophy and modern science.[18] As a student of Caballero, Varela was exposed to CaballeroÕs timid  incursions  into  modern  philosophy  and  modern  science  in  the  San  Carlos Seminary.  Under  Bishop  Espada,  the  seminary,  unlike  the  University  of  Havana, became  a  bastion  for  promoting  modern  ideas.  Thus,  Bishop  Espada  encouraged Varela to transcend futile, scholastic disputes.\n\nVarela  attempted  to  overcome  the  dogmatism  of  scholasticism  in  his  first philosophical  work, Propositiones  varie  ad  tironum  exercitationem (1812).  In  it,  he embraced classical eclecticism to combat the appeal to magister dixit , which had been commonly used in scholastic disputations, especially regarding the authority of Aristotle. He argued that eclectic philosophy  can learn from any school, provided the arguments and  ideas  are  compatible  with  sound  reason  and  experience.[19]  Nevertheless,  he dismissed scholasticism without undermining the value of AquinasÕs philosophy.[20]\n\nVarela  was  rather critical of Aristotle. He  described  AristotleÕs  widespread influence at the time as Òa species of  philosophical dictatorship.Ó[21]  He believed that AristotleÕs  glory  and  fame  might  be  partly  explained  by  the  great  conquests  of  his disciple Alexander the Great.[22]\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nBy  critically  engaging modern  philosophers,  such as Bacon,  Descartes,  Locke, Newton,  and  Kant,  Varela  transcended  the  stagnant  scholasticism  that  prevailed  in Cuba, especially in the University of Havana. So he promoted the secularization and the autonomy of philosophy  from the shackles of theology without abandoning his Catholic faith.  In his ÒElenco de 1816Ó [1816 Lecture Notes], he argued,  ÒThe Patristic Fathers have no authority whatsoever in philosophical matters; such matters ought to be solely dealt with by focusing on the reasons that support them.Ó[23]\n\nIn  1812,  Varela  had  already  contended  that,  with  the  new  developments  in science, Galileo,  Bacon,  and the Spanish doctor Antonio G-mez  Pereira attempted to overcome the ÒAristotelian yokeÓ by establishing a genuine philosophical approach. He acknowledged that  such a great honor belonged to Descartes who, according to him, relentlessly  fought  the Aristotelian acolytes. He went on to praise Isaac Newton as the father of modern physics and as the first among all those who tried to explain Nature. [24]\n\n## II The Polemic\n\nVarelaÕs  and  CousinÕs  philosophical  views  prompted  the  polemic  among enlightened  liberal  members  of  the  Cuban  intelligentsia  and  men  of  letters.[25]  As professors in  the University  of  Havana,  Manuel Gonz‡lez  del  Valle (1802-1884)  and especially  his  younger  brother  JosŽ  Zacar'as  Gonz‡lez  del  Valle  (1820-1851),  who translated one of CousinÕs works into Spanish, were respected scholars who defended CousinÕs eclecticism.[26] But since Luz  y Caballero and Manuel Gonz‡lez del Valle had been VarelaÕs students in the San Carlos Seminary,  VarelaÕs philosophical ideas were also lurking in the background of the polemic.[27]\n\nIn  an 1840 letter to a former student  who  had  inquired about  his views on the polemic,  Varela  wrote,  Ò  [T]he points of  the controversy  are three:  First,  whether  the teaching of Philosophy  should begin with Physics or with Logic; second, whether utility should be admitted  as a  principle  and  standard of  action;  third,  whether  the  Cousin system should be admitted.Ó[28] Therefore, the bulk of the polemic is about challenging philosophical issues regarding methodology, morality  and gauging CousinÕs eclecticism rather  than issues about  emancipatory  patriotism,  as some scholars contend, whom I discuss  in  the  third  section  of  my paper.  Hence,  in  this  section,  I  address  the philosophical issues first, and in  later sections I address issues regarding patriotism.\n\n## A. Methodology\n\nBy advocating teaching the natural sciences first, especially physics, rather than first  teaching  logic,  psychology,  and  morality,  as  it  was  customarily  done  in  the scholastic tradition,  Luz  y  Caballero contributed  to the polemic.  He  wrote,  ÒI  propose that  the philosophy  course begins with  physics and concludes with the study  of  logic and morality, which is precisely  the opposite of  how it is taught nowadays, and how it Inter-American Journal of Philosophy ! ! ! ! ! !

In 1835,  as director of  the College  of  San  Cristobal  (a.k.a  College  of  Carraguao)  in  Havana,  he  had  already argued in  favor  of  the  explanatory  method,  which  is based on  induction,  against  the formal method based on mathematics and pure memorization.[30]\n\nHaving been impressed by  BaconÕs inductive  method and  LockeÕs empiricism, Luz  y  Caballero  assumed  that  exposing  students  to  a  method  of  observation  and inductive  generalizations  would  prepare  them  to  acquire  true  knowledge.  Thus,  he assumed the truth of some controversial claims. For example,  he believed that from a chain of specific observations, students would acquire general causal knowledge about their specific experiences. Moreover, he presupposed, Ò [I]n natural sciences we go from the  facts  to  the  theory.Ó[31]  It  is  puzzling  that,  despite  being  familiar  with  HumeÕs philosophical ideas, he simply ignored HumeÕs challenging views on induction.[32]\n\nIn his passion for overcoming scholasticism and the dangers that he perceived in CousinÕs eclecticism,  Luz  y  Caballero was exuberant  about  the  inductive or scientific method.  Manuel  Castellanos Mojarrieta,  who  was a  lawyer  and  secretary  of  Puerto Pr'ncipe Town Hall in eastern Cuba, argued against Luz y CaballeroÕs pedagogical shift. Castellanos supported that logic continue to be taught  first  as a way  of understanding our particular observations in physics and the natural sciences. For him, to have a good understanding  of  physics,  we  first  need  to  have  a  solid  understanding  of  sound reasoning, which is provided by deductive logic.[33]\n\nIn his rejoinder to Castellanos, Luz  y  Caballero contended that the development of modern science, including chemistry, anatomy, and geology, resulted from applying the scientific method. The same is not true about what he referred to as the intellectual sciences, which included  philosophy, logic, psychology, and morality. According to him, the  scientific  method  had  been  so  successful  that  modern  psychologists  tried  to implement it even in the intellectual sciences.[34]\n\nLuz  y  Caballero preferred  inductive over  deductive  reasoning  because Francis BaconÕs defense of induction initiated a modern revolution in the natural sciences.[35] In the spirit of VarelaÕs eclecticism, who had already argued against the scholastic practice of  appealing  to magister  dixit ,  Luz  y  Caballero  ended  his  reply  to  Castellanos  by defending the power of reason over the power of authority. He wrote, ÒWe owe respect to  our  teachers  rather  than  blind  faith.Ó[36]  Yet  Castellanos  did  not  seem  to  be advocating  Òblind  faithÓ  to  anyone. He  simply disagreed  with  Luz y CaballeroÕs pedagogical approach.\n\n## B. Morality\n\nThe arguments between Manuel Gonz‡lez del Valle, a professor in the University of Havana, and the priest Francisco Ruiz, a professor at the San Carlos Seminary, show that the polemic veered to a debate on the nature of morality. While Valle defended a Inter-American Journal of Philosophy ! ! ! ! ! !

He, however,  favored RuizÕs utilitarianism.  Valle appreciated the role that the principle of utility  plays for improving peopleÕs well-being, especially in the economic realm. However, contrary to the principle of utility, he argued that the principle of deontological justice supervene upon all realms of  life based on peopleÕs intentions. [37]\n\nRuiz  highlighted  that  he  was using  the  term ÔutilityÕ  as  it  was  understood  by Socrates  and  Cicero.  He  quoted  with  approval  the  following  passage  from CiceroÕs work:  Òwhatever is honorable is beneficial.Ó[38]  So he challenged Valle to explain how the  principle  of  duty could  determine  the  nature  of  our  moral  actions.  For  Ruiz, discharging our duties must contribute to peopleÕs happiness.  If  so, he continued,  the principle of duty would necessarily be beneficial. Hence, according to Ruiz, the principle of duty  depends upon the principle of utility.[39] Furthermore, he argued that there is no real  distinction between justice and utility,  as Valle  presupposed. He maintained,  Ò  [J] ustice far from being different from utility constitutes, on the contrary, the supreme utility because in its applications it  can  provide  to society  and  thereby  to  its members the greatest happiness.Ó[40]\n\nJosŽ  Zacar'as  Gonz‡lez  del  Valle,  who  intervened  on  behalf  of  his  brother ManuelÕs deontological  view,  highlighted  RuizÕs conflation  of  the  right  and  the  good. JosŽ wrote, ÒThe language of all nations contains the terms goodness and utility, justice and interest, without successfully reducing them to one.Ó[41]\n\nSince  Valle cited parts  of Luz y CaballeroÕs  ÒElenco de  Carraguao  de 1835Ó [Lectures of Carraguao from 1835], where he criticized the principle of utility, Luz y  Caballero tried to explain his seemingly  incoherent  position regarding this principle. He  argued  that,  if  correctly  understood,  RuizÕs and  ValleÕs  positions  are  consistent. Therefore,  he  contended  that  the  principle  of  utility  and  the  principle  of  duty are reconcilable.\n\nLuz  y  Caballero  argued  against  ValleÕs deontological  view  because  the  latter provided  an  intuitionist  defense  of  the  principle  of  duty.  He  presupposed  that  an intuitionist defense of the principle of duty committed Valle to the notion of innate ideas. He, however, found the notion of innate ideas unilluminating.\n\nLuz  y  Caballero offered a distinctive understanding of the term Ôutility.Õ He wrote, Ò[U]seful is a railroad train but  more useful is justice.  The term useful is applicable to anything that we can benefit from whether physically or morally. And if we restrict its use to that which is moral, it is ascribable to generous or malicious actions.Ó[42] He and Ruiz defined the term ÔutilityÕ so broadly  that  it  includes the principle of  duty.

Eclecticism\n\nNext, the polemic focused on Victor CousinÕs eclecticism. For Cousin, eclecticism neither completely  rejects nor  completely  accepts any  philosophical  system;  it  simply selects from any  philosophical system that which seems to be true and good.[43]  He supports the liberty  of  philosophizing,  which is a foundational principle of  ancient and modern eclecticism.[44]\n\nEclecticism,  Cousin  argued,  Ò[W]as born  the  moment  that  a  sound  head  and feeling heart undertook to reconcile two passionate adversaries.Ó[45] So his eclecticism is  based  on  toleration.[46]  But  Cousin  goes  beyond  the  principle  of  toleration  in philosophy. He argues for the reconciliation of contraries in philosophy, such as idealism and empiricism, and theism and pantheism.[47]\n\nJules  Simon,  one  of  CousinÕs  leading  disciples,  argued  that  while  modern eclectics do not admit it, they cannot avoid the charge of syncretism.[48] Similarly, while never  mentioning  CousinÕs  eclecticism  by name,  Hegel,  who  praised  him  for  his translations of  ProclusÕs and PlatoÕs works,  found eclecticism Òsomething to be utterly condemnedÓ  as  a  hodgepodge  of incoherence.[49] Hence, some  of CousinÕs contemporary  counterparts  realized  that  his  eclecticism  was  philosophically  shallow, although not necessarily politically dangerous, as Luz y Caballero alleged.\n\nThe  zenith  of  the  polemic  was Luz  y  CaballeroÕs  arguments against  CousinÕs eclecticism in his essay, ÒImpugnaci-n a las Doctrinas Filos-ficas de Victor Cousin.Ó His motivation in challenging CousinÕs eclecticism was a feeling of  patriotism on behalf of the Cuban youth. He intended to alert the Cuban youth about  the detrimental effects that CousinÕs eclecticism could inflict on their fresh minds by  persuading them to steer away  from the  study  of  physiology  and  the  scientific  method as a  way  of  improving peopleÕs lives.[50]\n\nLuz  y  Caballero offered a two-pronged attack against CousinÕs eclecticism. First, he argued that by trying to reconcile that which is philosophically  incongruous, such as materialism and idealism, CousinÕs eclecticism was incoherent. And second, he alleged that CousinÕs eclecticism is Òpolitics masked as philosophy, nothing more than that.Ó[51] By  this  cryptic  metaphorical  expression,  he  probably  meant  that  Cousin  used  his eclecticism to defend the status quo in France during the July Monarchy.\n\nAs I  have already-mentioned, serious reservations arose, even among CousinÕs former disciples, about the coherence of his eclecticism. Moreover, one can grant to Luz y  Caballero that Cousin indeed used his eclecticism to support FranceÕs July Monarchy. One can even grant  him that  as a minister  of  public  instruction  during  1840,  Cousin promoted his eclecticism. Perhaps it is even fitting to call him Òofficial philosopher of the Inter-American Journal of Philosophy ! ! ! ! ! ! June, 2013\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nJuly  Monarchy.Ó[52] Cousin is the first to admit that  his eclecticism and his politics are congruent.[53] Yet they are also different.\n\nCousinÕs  eclecticism  was  first  and  foremost  philosophical.  His  philosophical works  prior  to  the  July Monarchy  attest  to  it.  Prior  to  1830,  Cousin  had  already published  some  of his important philosophical works  where  he  developed  his eclecticism,  such  as Philosophie sensualiste  au XVIII  siècle (1819); Fragments philosophiques (1826); and Cours de lÕ histoire de la philosophie (1829). Hence, Luz y CaballeroÕs allegation  that  CousinÕs  eclecticism was  Òpolitics masked  as philosophyÓ seems overstated.\n\nNevertheless, Luz y  CaballeroÕs concerns about CousinÕs eclecticism were partly justified. As in philosophy, reconciliation in politics is possible among those who share consistent  rather  than  inconsistent beliefs  and  principles.[54]  Moreover, CousinÕs eclectic spirit in politics during the 1830s liberal constitutional monarchy in France could be seen  as a virtue because with it,  Cousin tryied to  transcend  the vicious partisan politics. However, a similarly inspired eclectic spirit in CubaÕs politicsÑwhere the odious practice of slavery  was still rampant during 1830s and the captain general appointed by Spain enforced a ruthless despotismÑcould be seen as sanctioning a vicious society. [55]\n\nStill, Luz y CaballeroÕs  concern  about the  enervating  effect that CousinÕs eclecticism could have  exerted on  the  Cuban youth seems unpersuasive.  One  could conjecture that by persuading the Cuban youth to tolerate rather than to try to overcome the prevalent  despotism and the widespread practice of slavery, those who embraced CousinÕs eclecticism might have helped to prolong an unjust state of affairs in the island. Nevertheless,  this  would  be  a  questionable  conjecture  because  Cousin  was  rather critical of despotism and slavery.[56]\n\nCousin was consistently  clear on the following two  points Ñ he defended  the autonomy of philosophy and individual liberty. Simon, who was rather critical of CousinÕs eclecticism and of his politics,  acknowledged this: ÒUpon these two points he [Cousin] would not yield, and never did yield.Ó[57]\n\nSome contemporary  scholars acknowledge as much. For example, Alan Spitzer states that CousinÕs commitment Òto a completely unfettered exploration of fundamental questions  implied  the strong possibility of unacceptable conclusions.Ó[58] Such Òunacceptable conclusionsÓ could challenge the powers that be whether philosophical, political,  or  otherwise.  By  insisting  on  an  instrumental use of  philosophy,  and  by  his occasional appeal to patriotism, Luz y  Caballero inadvertently inspired an emancipatory myth,  namely  that  the polemic  was primarily  motivated by  an  emancipatory  sense of patriotism seeking independence from Spain.\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n## III Emancipatory Myth\n\nPolitically  conservative scholars, such as the late Humberto Pi-era, who was a respected  20th  Century  Cuban  philosopher,    progressive  scholars,  such  as  the  late Leopoldo Zea, who was an influential 20th Century  Mexican philosopher and historian of Latin American ideas,  and Neo-Marxist scholars, such as Alicia Conde and Eduardo Torres-Cuevas,  who  are  contemporary  Cuban  historians,  converge  on  promoting  an emancipatory myth. For them, the philosophical polemic is a watershed in the formation of Cuban national consciousness leading to CubaÕs independence from Spain.\n\nPi-era writes, ÒIn this polemic, one finds an important part of our history  and the hidden seed for the process of Cuban independence.Ó Moreover, he refers to this event as a Òcultural process that internally  hides a political question.Ó[59] Similarly, Zea states, ÒLuz y Caballero had entered the polemic for patriotic reasons.Ó[60]\n\nConde, like Torres-Cuevas, couches the polemic as a false dilemma. Those who conceived  of  modern philosophy  in the tradition of  Varela  and Luz  y  Caballero were patriots helping to forge Cuban national identity. Therefore, they  laid the foundation for CubaÕs  independence  from  Spain.  By contrast,  those  who  conceived  of  modern philosophy  in the  tradition of  CousinÕs eclecticism,  such as the brothers Gonz‡lez  del Valle, helped to preserve the status quo . Therefore, they  helped to maintain strong ties with Spain.[61]\n\nMoreover, Conde and Torres-Cuevas assume that those who embraced CousinÕs eclecticism, unlike Varela and Luz  y  Caballero, were defending their class interest  as members of a bourgeois slaveholding oligarchy.[62] Though Luz y Caballero was also a member of such bourgeois slaveholding oligarchy, he opposed Spanish despotism and slavery.[63] So did the brothers Gonz‡lez  del Valle too,  who as members of the liberal group spearheaded by  Domingo del Monte,  were critical of Spanish despotism.  They were also against the slave trade and favored gradual abolition of slavery.[64] Like the brothers  Gonz‡lez  del  Valle,  Luz  y  Caballero  never  advocated  independence  from Spain as a way  of ending Spanish despotism.[65] Nor did he ever propose a plan on how to abolish slavery in the island.\n\nIn the polemic, except for the long citation of VarelaÕs disquisition on patriotism excerpted from his Miscel‡nea Filos-fica by  one of Luz  y  CaballeroÕs opponents,   only scarce references to patriotism appear.  Luz  y  Caballero used the term ÔpatriotismÕ four times without actually defining or explaining it.[66]\n\nThe contenders seem to  have been motivated by  multifaceted  considerations. But  they  seem  to  have  been  motivated  primarily  by  philosophical  and  pedagogical reasons, and only secondarily by literary and/or political concerns understood in a broad sense. If that is so, then Pi-eraÕs, ZeaÕs, CondeÕs, and Torres-CuevasÕs interpretation of the polemic as having been motivated by patriotism conceived as a widespread Cuban desire  for  emancipation  from Spain  risks  being  anachronistic  and  hence  one-sided.\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThey seem to be reading back into a 19th-century debate their own 20th-century beliefs about it.\n\nThe  few scattered  references to  patriotism by  some  of  the  contenders  in  the polemic, especially by  Luz  y  Caballero, demonstrate a concern for the commonweal of the nation or patriotism in a generic sense. That is rather different from Pi-eraÕs, ZeaÕs, CondeÕs,  and  Torres-CuevasÕ  interpretation  that  the  polemic  was  motivated  by  an emancipatory patriotism seeking independence from Spain.\n\nNo evidence exists, in the polemic or in any  of the oeuvres of Luz y  CaballeroÕs inklings,  that  suggests  Luz  y  CaballeroÕs  favor  toward  emancipatory  patriotism.  Yet some of  his critics from Spain assumed that  he  championed emancipatory  patriotism because some of his formers students joined in the 1868 nationwide struggle of CubaÕs independence  from  Spain.[67]  Ironically,  some  of  his  sympathizers  had  assumed likewise.[68] Still, such an assumption is unwarranted.\n\nIn one of  his few political remarks about  CubaÕs independence, Luz  y  Caballero had  warned  about  how  dangerous  independence  from  Spain  could  be.[69]  In  the absence of  any  reliable  textual and/or oral evidence  supporting the  above-mentioned assumption, the assumption seems spurious. Hence, one can reasonably  assume that Luz y Caballero embraced generic rather than emancipatory patriotism.[70]\n\nThe contenders in the polemic engaged in disputations none of  which address issues of patriotism. Both camps engaged in the polemic welcomed modern philosophy, but  disagreed  on  which  version  of  it  should  be  adopted.  Those  who  embraced  the Cartesian cogito, CousinÕs modern eclecticism, and deontology  were more sympathetic to  Neo-Scholasticism than those who adopted BaconÕs induction,  LockeÕs empiricism, and  BenthamÕs utilitarianism.  This is so  because they,  like Cousin,  were open to  the possibility of ontological conjectures  about  the  existence  and  attributes  of  God independently of empirical considerations.\n\nThe  prevalent  emancipatory  myth  of  the  polemic  seems one-sided  consisting either in a straw man fallacy  or in a false dilemma.   This mythcan be seen as a straw man fallacy because there were motley philosophical controversies none of which was on patriotism per se . The myth can also be seen as a false dilemma because there are better explanations of the polemic based on reliable textual evidence. For example, in his brief  but interesting 1862 book on philosophy in Havana, JosŽ Manuel Mestre, who was  critical  of  CousinÕs  eclecticism,  revisited  the  polemic.  His  assessment  of  the polemic is congruent with VarelaÕs assessment  of  it back in 1840. For Mestre,  like for Varela, the philosophical debates during the polemic were primarily about the nature of philosophy,  such as the debate on the role of logic, morality, and CousinÕs eclecticism. [71]\n\nDuring the polemic, Luz y Caballero  deflected attention from  legitimate philosophical arguments by appealing to patriotism. In doing so, he tried to disqualify his Inter-American Journal of Philosophy ! ! ! ! ! !

In  the  absence  of  any evidence  to  the  contrary,  assuming  that  all  participants  in  the  polemic  thought  of themselves as bona fide patriots in the generic sense, especially  the brothers Gonz‡lez del Valle, who publicly acknowledged sincere respect for Varela and for Luz y Caballero, is reasonable.\n\nLike  Luz  y  Caballero,  the  brothers  Gonz‡lez  del  Valle  genuinely  loved  their country  and were working for the improvement of their  compatriots according to their own conception of the good. Thus, the implicit disagreement between Luz y  CaballeroÕs and their conception of the good for Cuban society  can be portrayed as a reasonable disagreement among people of good faith. Their explicit disagreements, however, were about how best to practice and teach philosophy in Cuba.\n\n## IV Conclusion\n\nI  have  shown  that  the  early  arguments  prior  to  the  Philosophical  Polemic  in Havana were mainly disagreements about the nature of philosophy, the role of theology in philosophical argumentation, and the overcoming of scholasticism in favor of modern philosophy  and modern science.  The newly  generated arguments by  the  polemic are primarily  about  methodology,  morality,  and the philosophical import  of  Victor  CousinÕs eclecticism. Hence, none of the newly generated arguments is about patriotism per se. Thus,  Luz y CaballeroÕs  occasional  appeal  to  patriotism  in  trying to justify his philosophical disquisitions, and thereby disqualify his opponentsÕ views, was based on a fallacious argumentum ad populum and/or a tacit ad hominem argument.\n\nI  have  argued  that  the  predominant  view  of  the  polemic,  which  has  been understood  to  be  motivated  by  a  widespread  Cuban  desire  for  independence  from Spain,  misleadingly  promotes  an  emancipatory  myth.  Such a  view  of  the  polemic  is anachronistic and hence one-sided, consisting either in a straw man fallacy  or a false dilemma.\n\nI  have also argued that  Luz  y  CaballeroÕs allegation that CousinÕs eclecticism is just politics  camouflaged  as  philosophy seems  overstated. Regardless  of the shortcomings of CousinÕs eclecticism, his liberal principle of toleration in philosophy and politics  and  his  arguments  supporting  the  autonomy  of  philosophy  have  helped  to establish  a  legacy respecting  the  unrestricted  liberty and  practice  of  professional philosophy.[72]\n\nDespite Luz  y  CaballeroÕs Herculean efforts on behalf  of  the liberty  of  teaching modern philosophy  and modern science in Cuba,  his appeal to  patriotism during  the polemic has paradoxically established a dangerous precedent. Henceforth, defenders of political  expediency  could  try to  justify and/or  excuse  acting  under  the  aegis  of patriotism to restrict the scope of public debates.\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nA  frequently  quoted  expression  by  Luz  y  Caballero  illustrates  the  risk  of  the above-mentioned threat. He wrote, ÒA philosopher, being tolerant, is cosmopolitan,  but he ought  to  be,  above  all,  patriotic.Ó[73]  He  seemed  oblivious to  a  real  tension  that existed between the practice of toleration in philosophy and politics and his cri de coeur to patriotism. Should those who are unpatriotic be tolerated? If so, to what extent should they be tolerated? Most importantly, who has the right to decide who is a genuine patriot and who is not? Luz y CaballeroÕs silence on these challenging questions is ominous.\n\nTo sum up, Luz  y  CaballeroÕs occasional appeal to patriotism to try  to rebut his opponentsÕ arguments unwittingly  provided  a  dangerous precedent  for  self-appointed guardians of patriotism to condition public debates. Perhaps such conditioning has been and still is a regrettable common practice in different parts of the globe. However, once we allow for people appealing to patriotism rather than to reason and argumentation to try  to settle philosophical debates, we are essentially  sanctioning the tyranny  of politics over reason. We might be unable to prevent such tyranny. Nevertheless, we can always be  vigilant  and  critical  about  those  who  try to  restrict  the  practice  of  professional philosophy and enjoyment of political freedoms anywhere in the world.\n\nVicente Medina Associate Professor of Philosophy Seton Hall University 400 South Orange, NJ 07079 973-761-9766 medinavi@shu.edu\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n## Notes\n\n*I  would  like  to  express  my  gratitude  to  my  colleagues Yvonne  Unna,  David OÕConnor, Mark Couch and Abe Zakhem for their valuable comments and suggestions.

He argued against the slave trade, but seemed to have favored gradual abolition. He even owned slaves. That is why  General Antonio Maceo, a hero of Cuban independence of African ancestry,  was  highly  critical  of  him.  See  J.  Castellanos  and  I.

In  his testament,  however,  Luz  y  Caballero is critical  of  slavery  and leaves money  to free as many slaves as possible who worked at his sugar mill, La Luisa .

Sanguily wrote  a  critical  study  of  Luz  y  Caballero  as  a  response  to  Rodr'guezÕs  meticulous biographical work. Unlike Rodr'guez, he offered an interpretation of Luz y Caballero as a  patriot  whose  teaching  favored,  rather  than  opposed,  CubaÕs  independence  from Spain. However,  he offered circumstantial evidence for his questionable interpretation. See Sanguily, JosŽ de la Luz y Caballero: Estudio Cr'tico , 197-199; see also E.
