He had been invited to take up the chair of philosophy 'with special reference to the history and theory of the inductive sciences' that had been created for another physicist-cum-philosopher, Ernst Mach, in 1895. Mach himself had previously served for almost thirty years as professor of experimental physics  in Prague,  and it will  be important in what follows to remember that Prague was still to some extent a German city and a centre ofintellectual activity almost no less important than Vienna herself.  The lines of communication between the two former Imperial-Royal capital cities 2  were still strong, and the same figures  were often, at different times, prominent in each.\n\nThe two  cities  shared  also  the  characteristically .  Austrian predilection nurtured, certainly, by the culture of  the coffee house for forming clubs, societies, and discussion groups. 3 Austrian cultural life was indeed to a striking extent  a  matter  of 'schools',  'movements'  and 'circles  of  contemporaries',  and one might pause to reflect on the degree to which such schools and movements  have  determined  the  artistic,  intellectual  and political world we inhabit  today. Thus  consider,  in  no particular order,  the  Vienna  psychoanalytic  movement,  the Zionist  movement  founded  by  Theodor . Herzl,  the  'new Viennese school' of composition around·  Arnold Schonberg, the school of  linguists and psychologists around Karl Buhler, the school of  Austrian economics founded by Carl Menger in\n\n1871  and evolving, by degrees, into the circle around Ludwig von Mises and the young Friedrich von Hayek in the 1920s. Or consider the 'Prager  Kreis'  of  novelists and critics around Max Brod, Felix Weltsch and Franz Kafka; or the Prague linguistic. circle  of  Roman  Jakobson,  Jan  Mukafovsky  and  Nikolai Trubetskoy; or the so-called Louvre circle, a discussion group of  adherents of  Brentanian philosophy meeting fortnightly in the Cafe Louvre in Prague, to which the young Franz Kafka also belonged. 4 ·\n\nSchlick,  too,  had his  regular Thursday evening discussion circle.  This  comprised above all  a  group of mathematicians around Hans Hahn, himself a former student of Mach, and including Kurt Godel, Gustav Bergmann, Karl Menger (son of the  economist  Carl)  and  Schlick's  own  assistant  Friedrich' Waismann.  The Schlick  circle  included  also  Philipp  Frank, another former student of Mach based principally in Prague (where he had succeeded Einstein in the  chair of  physics); and it included also Herbert Feigl,  Viktor Kraft, Rudolf Carnap, and a sociologist-cum~philosopher, proletarian in manner and socialist  in his opinions,  5  by the name of  Otto N  eurath.\n\nCarnap  is,  apart  from  Schlick  himself,  the  single  native German on this list, and it  is indeed  remarkable to consider the extent to which not merely logical positivism but also the exact or scientific philosophy of  which it formed a part was and is a characteristically Austrian phenomenon.  One  thinks  in  this connection not only of  Mach, but  also of  another Prague figure of  an earlier generation, Bernard Bolzano. Bolzano was on the one hand a priest and social reformer, author of  one of  the last social  utopias (Vom  besten  Staate); but he  was  also  a  notable mathematical logician and philosopher of science, though his contributions in these fields were unfo1 tunate!y largely ignored until after his death..  One thinks of  Ludwig Boltzmann, hero of Wittgenstein and contemporary of Mach· in Vienna; and indeed one thinks of Wittgenstein himself, of Ludwik Fleck, Karl Popper, Michael Polanyi, Paul Feyerabend, Wolfgang Stegmiiller and Imre Lakatos all of them Austrians (orAustro-Hungarians) who have, for better of  worse, done much to determine the shape of  the philosophy of  science as we know it today. 6\n\n7\n\nHere it is perhaps Ludwik Fleck who deserves most mention. Fleck was born in 1896 in Lemberg (Lw6w), capital of Galicia on the eastern fringes  of the Empire.  He was  the author of\n\n--------- - some  200  scientific  papers  in  the  areas  of  medicine  and microbiology. 7 But  he  was also the author  of  a longer, philosophical  work,  published  in  1935,  entitled Genesis  and Development  of a Scientific  Fact.  Introduction  to  the  Doctrine  of Cognitive  Style  and  of the  Thought-Collective. This  work  is  of interest first of all  because,  as  a  contribution to  the nascent discipline of 'sociology of science', it anticipates and perhaps even served to inspire some of  the !}OW so influential ideas of Thomas  Kuhn  (who  in  fact  contributed  a  preface  to  the English translation of  the work). But it is of  interest also, as we shall  see  below,  because  Fleck  was  one  of  a  number  of Lemberg-based philosophers and philosophically-minded scientists and mathematicians who were to become associated, in different ways, with the developments in scientific philosophy that were taking place to the west and Lemberg will,  like Prague, have a quite special role to play in the story that follows.\n\n,  The  native German philosophers  who  have  made  serious contributions  to  exact  philosophy or  to  the  philosophy  of science in the modern sense are, in contrast, remarkably few, and of these .one thinks particularly of Hans Reichenbach and  Carl  Hempel it  can  often  be  asserted that  the .true flowering oftheir thought  and influence has occurred through formal or informal collaboration with their Austrian teachers or  contemporaries. 8 Of quite  specific  interest  for  our own purposes is the fact that so many of  these philosophers, as also of the sympathetic philosophically-minded German scientists -one thinks in particular of Kurt Grelling and of  the Gestalt psychologists Wolfgang Kohler and Kurt Lewin were based in  Berlin,  where the  'Society for  Empirical  Philosophy' was · established  in  1928  as a  counterpart to the Schlick circle  in Vienna  ..\n\n## Philosophy and politics\n\nAyer  himself arrived  in  Vienna in  late  November of 1932, spending a protracted honeymoon of  just  over three months in Austria before returning to Oxford to write Language,  Truth and Logi,c. The Schlick circle was at this time at the very height of  its activity. It  had already organised its first two international conferences, and at the first of  these, held in Prague in 1929,\n\nhad distributed copies of  its manifesto, the 'Wissenschaftliche Weltauffassung' or 'Scientific Conception of  the World'. This was written, effectively, by Neurath, with Carnap and Hahn (and  to a  lesser extent other members of the circle)  serving merely to  temper some of Neurath's wilder flights of fancy. The patrician Schlick, to whom the manifesto was dedicated, was  less  than  satisfied  with  the· result.  This  Was  first  of all because he was not taken by the conception of the circle as a 'movement'  of any sort, favouring a more modest and more narrowly scientific approach:\n\nSchlick  hated  everything  that smacked  of agitation,  was against it all: 'It is not necessary for us to agitate: that we can leave to the political parties: in science we say what we have found, we hope to say the truth; and if  it is the truth, then it will win out.'  (Haller  and Rutte, p.31)\n\nBut it was also because he was distressed by the political tone of the  piece,  and  more  specifically  by  those  portions  which suggested some sort of alignment of logical  positivism  with socialism  and with  the  movement for workers' education in Vienna at the time.\n\nThe circle  had  already,  by  1932,  taken  over with  the group around Reichenbach in Berlin  the  journal Annalen der Philosophie, renaming it Erkenntnis. And it had published some six volumes  of  its  series of Schriften zur  wissenschaftlichen Weltauffassung, including works by Richard voh. Mises (brother of the economist Ludwig),  and by  Carnap, Schlick,  Neurath and Philipp Frank, together with a peculiar work, entitled On the  Biology  of Ethics:  Psychopathological  Investigations  of Guilt› Feelings  and the Formation of  Moral Ideals:  A Contribution on the Essence of  the Neurotic Human Being, by a certain Otto Kant. 9\n\nAyer himself, who attended the weekly discussion meetings of  the circle and a .course of  university lectures given by Schlick on the philosophy of  science, seems not to have been troubled by the puzzle as to why it should have been Austria, specifically, that witnessed such a. peculiar flowering of  scientific philosophy.  His  autobiography  does .  however  contain  one remark on what Ayer saw as  the political role of the group around Schlick:\n\nThe  members  of  the  Vienna  Circle,  with  the  notable\n\nI\n\nexception of Otto Neurath, were not greatly interested in politics, but theirs was also a political movement. The war of ideas which they were waging against the Catholic church .  had its  part in the perennial Viennese conflict betwe&lt;Jl the socialists and the clerical reaction. (1977, p.129)\n\nA  thesis  along  these  lines  has  indeed  been  argued  quite seriously  by  the  Viertnese  historian  Friedrich·  Stadler,  who provides us with a great mass of  documentation to support his case. Stadler suggests that we see the University of Vienna in the interwar period as split jnto 'two  camps':\n\non the one side, in the realm of  scientific philosophy, there dominated  democratic  (enlightenment,  liberal,  socialist) tendeiicie§; OI). the other  side there was a spectrum of  almost all  forms  of anti-democratic  feeling,  from  neo-romantic conservatism  to  fascist-totalitarian  outgrowths.  Thus  it  is tempting to see the philosophical life as  part of the fierce party-political Kulturkampf of  the time, between·  the bourgeois camp and the workers'  movement. (1979, p.42)\n\nThe  idea  that  the  flowering  of scientific phit~ophy in Austria can be accountedfor by regarding the Schlic circle as a  manifestation .of Austrian socialism,  or of anti-de  ·calism, seems however to be at best the product of a certain sort of over-tidy wishful thinking. Why, one might ask, did socialist anti\"clericalism not lead to similar phenomena in France, or Spain, or Italy? And how is .such a thesis to cope with the fact that so few important Austrian philosophers of  science, and so few of  the members of  the Vienna circle N  eurath, Hahn and  · Carnap constituting here the principal exceptions ,...... were of socialist persuasion? 10\n\nNeurath was,  it must be admitted,  the most vocal and the most ardently propagandistic of  the group around Schlick. It was  Neurath's  conspicuous advocacy of crackpot schemes for 'international planning for freedom' and for an ~economy in kind' as a substitute for prices andmarkets 11 which dissuaded Hayek from making overtures to the group after his interest had been sparked by his friend  and fellow member  of  the Mises circle  Felix  Kaufmann.  And  as  the  case  of Schlick  himself surely  makes  clear,  12  it  would be overly simplistic to  see the circle in particular or  Viennese scientific philosophy in general\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI.\n\nI\n\n.....\n\nas in any sense a part of  the Austrian socialist movement.\n\nHow,  then,  are  we  to  explain  the  fact  that,  as  far.  as achievemen.t and wider influence is  concerned, scientifically oriented  philosophy of science was  the  dominant branch of philosophy in Austria?\n\nA more subtle answer to this question,  deriving from  the work of  the Hungarian philosopher  J. C, Nyiri,  13  might read as follows.  On the one hand one can point to ihe fact that, while the Austrian Empire was the equal of  Germany in the cultural field, it  lagged behind its richer  and more  developed neighbour to the west in the spheres of intellect and science. The Habsburg Empire had witnessed a relatively late process of urbanisation,  bringing  also  a  late  development  of those libetal habits and values which would seem to be a necessary presupposition of the modern, scientific attitude. It therefore lacked  .institutions and traditions of  scientific research of the ·sort that  had  been  established  and  cultivated  in  Germany throughout the nineteenth century. On  the other hand, as the more .liberal and enlightened ways began to be established in . Austria  -· effectively  in  the .  second. half of the  nineteenth century ........  the  desire  to  enjoy  the  various  trappings  of  a ·.  jnodetn; erilighteried  culture  made  itself strongly felt. The Austrians were not, however, in a position to summon forth ·  \".the  ineap.s  to  create  serious  and  reputable  institutions  and traditj.ons of  science in. the narrow sense. This, as Nyiri puts it, created 'a  vacuum which the theory of  a practice so attractively · pursued  elsewhere  could  then  fill' 14  a  thesis  illustrated partiCl\\larly clearly by the case of  Mach, whose lack of  funds for serious experiments in physics seems to have constrained him tq  turn  .. instead  to  the  (cheaper)  fields  of physiology  and ·  .psycholi&gt;gy,  and.  to  the  work in  history  and  philosophy  of science which occupied him especially at the end of  his life.\n\nAn  account  along  these  lines  is  supported' further  by pointing to the  absence  in  the  Empire .of  any  entrenched national  philosophy  of the  Kantian  or ·Hegelian sort.  This implied  that, when the Jime came for the establishment of a modern and scientifically  inspired philosophy in Austria, there was very little of  substance against which the new philosophical developments  had  to  compete.  Catholic Austria was  indeed largely free 'of  the  influence of German  (Protestant) idealist metaphysics,  15  an influence which has done so much to thwart the development of exact philosophy in Germany itself. This\n\n'\n\n'\n\nwas  not least in virtue of the fact that the works of both Kant and Hegel, as notorious effluvia of  the French revolution, were for  a time induded in  the  Papal index of prohibited  books; Their  place  was  taken  by  a  peculiarly  superficial  form  of scholasticism-larded, here and there, with bitS of  Leibniz and Herbart, but still quite liter3.ny an inheritance of the middle ages. The canons and textbooks of  this doctrine were imposed upon the. institutions  of learning&gt; throughout the  Empire,  a state  of affairs  which  was  to  end only  with  the  educational reform&amp; after  1848,  leaving  the way  clear for  more  positive developments, some of  which willbe considered below.\n\nThis is of  course in contrast to  the German case, where the strength of the idealist metaphysics  had derived  in no small part  from  the  fact  that  it  was  closely  associated  with  the development both of German nationalistic feeling and of the German nation itself. Kant, Hegel, Fichte and Schelling came thereby to occupy an entrenched position in German thought and feeling (comparable, perhaps; to the position of Catholicism in contemporary Poland or in the Irish Republic)  . At no time was philosophy rooted in this way in the structure.  of the AustHan state,'  An Empire which was at bestan accidental compromise, a dynastic convenience of the Habsburg family itself,  seemed  indeed to be lacking in'  all potential for legiti› mation on the plane ofphilosophy. 16  The primary legitimacy of  the Empire was seen as lying much rather in its role as the last bulwark of Catholic Christianity against the expansionist powers of  Russia and Turkey to the east.\n\nThere is however a further reason for the absence in Austria of a  counterpart  to  German  idealist  metaphysics.  For  the Austrians, similar in this respect to the English and the Scots, have tended to react  with  derisory  suspicion  in  the  face  of 'metaphysical systems' (when,  that  is  to  say,  these  are  put forward as·  the constructions of man).  This may explain also why  those  native German  philosophers  who  have  favoured painstaking argument  and  ·careful  empirical  work over grandiose speculation  have  to an extent been able  to find  a receptive audience in Austrian universities.  17\n\n## TheNeurath-Haller thesis\n\nMuch  of the  previous  section  consisted  in  the  attempt to provide an explanation of developments in the intellectual or cultural.  sphere by  appeal  to  underlying social  or econo~ic factors.  (as  the  relative  predominance of the coffee house m Austria  might  be  made  understandable  by  pointing to  the long-standing shortage of  adequate housing in the major cities  . of.the Empire).  Explanations of this  kind  have been found tempting both by Marxist thinkers  and also by advocates of  the new  'economic .approach .  to  human  behaviour'. 18  Where, however, we are dealing with complex movements of  thought and doctrine, they would seem to be at best only partial. For they cannot give us jnsight into the precise intellectual content of the. movements in question. Why did the Austrians' initial substitute for true scientific development take precisely these (alternatively phenomenalist  and  physicalist) forms,  rather than those? What is to account for the peculiarhlend  of  British empiricism ·and  Russellian. logic  which  provided .. the  basic framework  within which, in their various ways, the members of the Schlick circle would operate?\n\nClearly, and for all the dominance of  schools and movements in any particular case, it can only be by pointing to the influence of  specific individuals that  we shall provide truly satisfactory answers  to questions such as these. And there are a number of  candidate individuals whodoimmediately come to mind,  including  Boltzmann  whose  vision  of a  unitary science made itself  felt not  only  among physicists but  also in the wider intellectual community in Vienna-and  Wittgenstein whose Tractatus exerted a not inconsiderable influence on both Schlick  and  Carnap in  precisely the  formative  years of the Vienna Circle. We may presume, reasonably, that no social or economic explanation of  the genius of  Boltzmann or Wittgenstein (or Godel, .or  Einstein)  would be forthcoming. Yet  it  would,  on  the  other  hand,  be  insufficient·  for  our purposes to look at individuals in abstraction from the wider social and institutional context in which they worked. For the individual will  himself have been shaped by his surrounding culture,  and his  ideas will  at least to some extent have been, determined thereby, whether.positively, through absorption, or negatively, through critical reaction. Moreover, these ideas will be able to take root in this surrounding culture only to the\n\nI\n\nj\n\n?\n\n)\n\nextent that they strike a congenial chord in the thinking of those to whom they are addressed. Hence also an individual of genius  will have  a  greater  opportunity  to  influence  the thinking of others to the extent that he has an oratorical or p~dagogical talent. Longevity, too, may play a not insignificant role. But further: a body of  thought that is promulgated from a number of  distinct centres and in such a way as to attract the representatives of  a number of  different disciplines will, other things being equal, have a greater chance of  becoming influen› tial;  for it will have the opportunity to make an impression on the thinking of  different members of  its audience by degrees, by appealing  simultaneously to their  several  competing interests.\n\nMost importantly, however, an individual, even an individual of genius,  is  able  to  exert an influence  upon his contemporaries only to the extent that there are institutions ~hich can  facilitate the dissemination of  his ideas. Hence there is a need, in regard to our own specific problem, to provide a mixed explanation, one that makes room both for social and ·economic factors of  the kind so far considered and also for the serendipitous role of individuals. A remarkably forceful and coherent  explanation  along  these  lines  has  been  provided, ironically ~nm.J.gh, by the much-maligned Otto Neurath in the section  labelled  'Prehistory'  of the  Vienna  Circle  manifesto already mentioned above,  and I .shall here deal in turn with each of  the four main components in Neurath's  account.\n\n- I. The fact that Vienna provided especially fertile soil for the  development  of  the  scientific  C0,9.\\_ception  is,  Neurath argues, 'historically understandable' first .  of all as a consequence  of the  growth  of liberalism  in  Vienna  in the second.half of the nineteenth century. Indeed he claims that liberalism was in this period: ··\n\nthe dominant political current ~n Vienna. Its world of  ideas stems from ·  the enlightenment, from empiricism, utilitarianism and the free trade movement of  England. In Vienna's  liberal  movement, ~cholars of  world  renown occupied leading positions. Here an anti\"metaphysical spirit· was cultivated, for instance, by men like Theodor Gomperz (who translated the works of J S.  Mill), and by Suess, Jodi\n\nand  others.  (Neurath,  1973,  p.  301,  translation amended slightly)\n\nThis liberal atmosphere  fostered  also,  Neurath  telfs  us,  the development  in  Austria of scientifically  oriented  popular education --.,. leading eventually  .to the school reform movement  of  the  1920s  in  which· Wittgenstein,  ·perhaps inadvertently, participated.\n\n- II.  Mach,  too, was  a  product  of  this  Viennese  liberal enlightenment, which was as it were compressed, in Austria, into the short span of a few decades.  His  formative years as  · student  and 1:rivatdozent were  spent  in  Vienna,  where.  his political attitudes ~ subsequently.  to reveal themselves in his activities as Rector oft.he still unified University of Prague were  also  shaped  ..  These  same  attitudes  then  manifested themselves  also,  Neurath  suggests,  in  Mach's philosophy of science,. and  specifically  in  his  attempt  to  'purify'  empirical science of  metaphysical notions:\n\nWe recall his critique of absolute space which made him a forerunnerofEinstein, his struggle against the metaphysics of  the thing-in-itself  and of  the conceptof  substance, and his investigations of  the construction of  the concepts cif science from ultimat~ elements,  namely,  sense  data.  (Neurath, 1973, p. 302)\n\nThe  influence  of Mach  and  of his  successor  Boltzmann, Neurath nciw argues, !makes it understandable'  whythere was in Vienna 'a  lively dominant  interest in th~ epistemological and logical  problems  that  are  linked  with  the  foundations  of physics' (Neurath 1973, p.302). This influence was, certainly, of  lasting importance, despite the fact that, after only six years as professor in Vienna, Mach was forced by ill-health to retire. Thus  Hayek,  for  example,  reports  that  he  and  his  contem› poraries on arriving in Vienna to take up their studies in the immediate  post-war  years  'found in  Mach  almost  the  only arguments against a metaphysical and mystificatory attitude' such as  was  manifested by the dominant philosophers in the University at the time:\n\nfrom Mach one was then led on to Helmholtz, to Poincare t/\n\n.  to·  similar thinkers, and of cour~, ·for those who went into ·the matter systematically such as my friend Karl Popper, to all  the  natural  scientists  and  philosophers  of the  period. (Hayek, 1960, p.421)\n\nThe quite special importance of Mach for the Vienna Circle itself can be seen in the fact that they gave the name 'Verein Ernst Mach' to the,public lecture society which they founded, as ·a supplement to their other activities, in 1929.\n\n- Iii.  Neurath  mentions  also  a number  of Viennese  social thinkers,  from both the Marxist and the non-Marxist camps, who had 'served  consciously in the spirit of  the enlightenment' in  the  late  nineteenth century. 19  Above  all he  mentions  the work  of Carl  Menger; .pointing  out  that  'in the  sphere  of political economy, too, a rigorously scientific method was culti› vated  by  the ·school of marginal  utility' which  Menger  had founded  in  1871.  Menger's  methodological  individualistic doctrines, especially as developed by Mises and by Hayek, can indeed be seen as standing in opposition to German historicist ·  and collectivist doctrines in the sphere of  economics in a way that parallels the opposition &lt;if,  say, Bolzano or Mach to Kant and Hegel. Moreover, these doctrines constitute a synthesis of liberal political and economic ideas with the affirmation of  the importance of scientific rigour of  just the sort that is required by Neurath's thesis~ 20\n- IV.  Apart  from' Mach; however, the most  important individual philosopher mentioned by Neurath in his account of  the  Viennese  prehistory  of  logical  positivism  is  Franz Brentano. The ground was cleared for the endeavours of  the Vienna Circle in the direction of a reform of logic and of a concern with problems of  foundations also, as Neurath himself puts it, 'from  quite another  quarter':\n\nthrough Fra~z Brentano (professor of philosophy ...  from 1874 to 1880, later Dozent in the philosophical faculty). As a ·Catholic  priest Brentano had an understanding for scholas› ticism; he started directly from the scholastic logic and from Leibniz's endeavours  to  reform logic,. while  leaving  aside Kant  and  the  idealist  system-philosophers.  Brentano and his students showed time and again their understanding of\n\nmen like Bolzano and others who were working towards a rigorous new foundation oflog!c (Neurath, 1973, p.302)\n\nBrentano, too,  was  marked by the Austrian liberalism of the nineteenth  century  (thus  for  example  he  played  an  instru› mental role in commissioning the young Sigmund Freud who had been for a time a devoted admirer ofBrentano's  work -to translate one of the volumes in the already mentioned Gomperz  edition  of  the  works  of  Mill 21 ). Of  Brentano's students, Neurath mentions in particular Alois Hofler (18531922), who had organised numerous discussions on Brentanian  perspectives in logic and foundations  under the auspices  of  the.  Philosophical  Society  at  the  University  of Vienna, a forum in which, as Neurath puts it, 'the  adherents of the scientific world conception were strongly represented'. 22\n\nNeurath mentions also 'Alexius  von Meinong, a member of Brentano's  Viennese Circle from 1870-1882 and later professor in Graz, whose theory of objects has certainly some affinity to modern theories of· concepts'. (Neurath is presumably referring here to the similarities pointed out also  by  Carnap ~ between Meinong's work on higher order objects  and  Carnap's Logical  Structure of  the World. 23 ) He mentions also Meinong's  pupil Ernst Mally, who had been one of  the first Austrians to  work on t.he  logic of Whitehead and Russell and would later play a seminal role in the development of  deontic logic.\n\nBrentano,  for  all  his  scholastic  background,  was  not only sympathetic to a rigorously scientific method of  philosophy; he shared with the logical positivists also a certain anti› metaphysical  orientation 24 and his  work  involves  the  use  of methods oflanguage an,,alysis similar, in some respects, to those developed  later  by  philosophers  in  England.  The  distin› guished Graz  philosopher Rudolf Haller has  indeed argued that it  makes  sense  to  point to  these  features which were shared  in  common  not  only  by  Brentano  and  the  logical positivists but  also by thinkers  as diverse  as M.ach  and Wittgenstein as constituting what might be called a 'typically Austrian  philosophy'. 25 Hailer's writings  on  the  history  of Austrian philosophy 26  have not merely extended and clarified the Neurath interpretation; they have also contributed to our understanding of GLYPH(cmap:df00)erman~language philosophy  as  a  whole.\n\nFor Haller has shown that  it is possible to distinguish within this whole  a  coherent  alternative  to ·the  speculative  idealisms predominant in. Germany proper. But now,  if this  Neurath› Haller thesis can be accepted, it follows that the Vienna Circle itself comes  to  be  linked, via  Brentano, to  Catholic scholasti› cism.  Indeed one could go further and point to the method of communal  philosophical  argument ofphilosophising by means of a sometimes  ritualised  process of discussion as something  that is  shared,  not  merely  by  Brentano and  the medieval  schoolmen,  but also  by  Schlick,  with  his  Thursday evening discussions, and indeed by Wittgenstein in his cell in Cambridge.\n\n· The  Neurath-Haller  thesis  .is not  without  its  problems however. Thus it seems that in the actual discussions  of the Vienna Circle the works of Meinong or Hofler or Mally to say nothing of the medievals were hardly mentioned, and Brentano  himself was  discussed  only  because  his  work  on ethics was chosen by Schlick as a special object of  criticism.\n\nThe thesis has been attacked most especially by the Viennese sociologist.left, which of course cannot stomach the idea that the 'two camps' of Catholic reaction and progressive socialist neopositivism  should become  confused  together in  the way described. Friedrich Stadler, in particular, has suggested that ~in contrast to the picture of  the typical Austrian philosopher painted  by  Neurath  and  Haller the  influence  of logical positivistideas, or of scientific philosophy in general, was  in fact rather small, at least as concerns the official life of  Vienna University in the period 1918-38. What predominated, both in lecture  courses  and  in  dissertation  topics,  was  rather  the history of  philosophy of  a.rather old~fashioned sort, dealing in Kant,  Schopenhauer,  Spinoza,  Plato,  Nietzsche.  The  circle around Sch.lick  can  be  seen  from  this  point of view  to  have consisted  largely  of  philosophical  outsiders  or  cranks,  of individuals who would in fact be taken seriously only sometime later and only without the boundaries of Austria herself.\n\nWhat  is  important for our purposes,  however,  is  not the education of the inter-war generation in Vienna, the gener~ ation which  would  come of age in  the period (say)  1939-45. Rather, we are interested in those intellectual currents which had shaped and determined the thinking of  specific members of the generation already mature in the inter-war period, and in particular given rise to such schools as the Schlick and Mises\n\ncircles. And to pick out such currents it will not suffice simply to  examine the sheer numbers of lectures or dissertations on different themes-for  this is to ignore  just  those differences of quality, achievement and wider influence which are here all› important.\n\n## The school of  Franz Brentano\n\nFranz  Brentano (1838-1917) was  born in  Marienberg, near Boppard  on  the  Rhine,  of a  distinguished  Italian-German family  whose forbears included Clemens Brentano, Carl von Savigny and Bettina von  Arnim.  He studied in Berlin under the  .Aristotle  scholar  Adolf  Trendelenburg,  and  later  in Wiirzburg, where he took holy orders  in 1864 and where, from 1866, he taught philosophy. In part as a result of  difficulties in accepting the dogma of  Papal infallibility, Brentano withdrew from  the  priesthood  in .1873  and  this  necessitated  also  a withdrawal  from  Wiirzburg. In  1874  he  was appointed professor of  philosophy in Vienna, where he taughtfor some twenty years with great success; Brentano movedtmFlorence in 1896 and from  there to Zurich in  1915,  where he died two. years later. 27\n\nBrentano remained a quite  singularly powerful figure  in Austrian philosophy even when, for technical reasons connected with his marriage as an ex-priest, he was forced to resign his chair in  1880. It is one of the tragedies of  Austrian philosophy  that,  due  to  the  repeated interventions  of the Emperor, Brentano was not re-appointed to a professorial post in Vienna after his  marriage, despite the fact that, year after year, his re-election to such a post was carried unico voco by the faculty  itself.  Brentano remained in Vienna as a mere Privat› dozent until 1895. He was thereby able to exert  his influence in Vienna as a teacher, but his students and disciples were largely forced to turn elsewhere in order to pursue their philosophical careers. Had Brentano been able truly to establish himself  and his school in the University of  Vienna, then it seems clear that the  philosophy  of Austria  in  this  century  would  have  been significantly different. It may, therefore, have been a somewhat  ironic  consequence  of  the  Emperor's  veto  of Brentano's appointment in  the  name of Christian propriety, that  he  thereby  left  the  way  clear  in  Vienna  for just such positivistic  and  atheistic  movements  of  thought  as were promulgated by Schlick and his circle in the 20s and 30s  ..\n\nAnother  consequence  was  that  Brentanian ideas  came  to predominate  in  other  centres  of learning  both  within  and without  the  Empire.  Thus  centres  of  Brentanian  or  of Brentano-inspired  thought  were  established  particularly  in Prague and in Lemberg, and Brentano's  students held chairs also  in  Graz  and  Czernowitz,  as  well  as  in  Berlin,  where Stumpf, formerly in  Prague, was  professor in the University for over thirty years.\n\nBrentano's influence  was  not  restricted  to  philosophers. Among those who came under his spell were also a number of important thinkers in the Church, as well as such figures as T. G.  Masaryk,  later  President  of the  Czechoslovak  Republic. What  is  most  remarkable  about .Brentano,  however,  is  the extent  to  which  his  most  important  philosophical  heirs  Kasimir Twardowski in Lemberg, Christian von Ehrenfels and Anton Marty in Pr~gue, Carl Stumpf  in Prague and Berlin, as well as Meinong and Husserl-have distinguished themselves by the power  and originality of  their thinking, which amounted in each.  case  to a more or less radical transformation of Brentanian ideas. 28 Moreover each had influential students of  his own, to the extent that, leaving aside certain exclusively Anglo-Saxon developments, a table ofBrentano's  students and of his students'  students would come close to embracing all of the most important philosophical movements of  the twentieth century,\n\nTwardowski (1866-1938) was born in Vienna and took his· PhD under Brentano with a dissertation on Descartes in 1892. After a short period as Privatdozent in  Vienna he moved  to Lemberg in 1895. On the basis of  work on logic and psychology inspired  by  Brentano (and  due in  no  small  part to  his  own brilliance  as  a  teacher),  he then went on  to establish  almost single-handedly  a  tradition  of exact  philosophy  in  Poland which was to include all of the important figures of  the Polish philosophical  renaissance of the first  decades of the present century.  29  Thus  present at different  times  in  Lemberg and falling  under  Twardowski's  influence  were, inter  alia, the historian  Wladyslaw Tatarkiewicz,  the phenomenologist and aesthetician Roman Irigarden, the logicians St. Lesniewski, Jan Lukasiewicz and Tadeusz Czei:owski,  the. already mentioned Ludwik Fleck, 30  as well as philosophers later sympathetic to the\n\nVienna logical empiricist movement such as  Tadeusz  Kotar› binski  and  Kazimierz  Ajdukiewicz. 31 Members of the  circle around Twardowski were gradually transplanted to Warsaw, where Le8niewski, especially, was domina,nt, and it was from there that contacts with the Vienna Circle were initiated in the spring of 1930 by Alfred Tarski. Carnap in turn visited Warsaw in  November  of that year.  He gave  lectures  to  the Warsaw Philosophical  Society  and  had  discussions  with  Lesniewski, Kotarbinski  and Tarski,  at just about the  time  when  Tarski himself was developing his semantic conception of  truth. 32\n\nEhrenfels (1859-1932), professor in Prague for more than thirty  years, was  above  all  responsible,  together  with  his student  Max  Wertheimer,  for  initiating  that \\_revolution  in psycl;iological research which is associated with the concept of Gestalt, a revolution to which contributions were made also by Ehrenfels' teacher  Meinong  in  Graz  and  subsequently  by Buhler  in  Vienna. 33 Meinong's followers  would  go  on  to establish a school of Gestalt psychology that  is still influential in Italy today,  and not least in the  former  Imperial-and-Royal Port  City  of Triest.  The  group  around  Buhler  (to  which incidentally the yo:ing Karl Popper belonged), promulgated a naturalistic philosophy of  Gestalten similar, in many respects, to  the  work  of Stumpf.  Buhler's student  Egon  Brunswik, especially, was to make importantcontributions to this Vienna Gestalt psychology before allying himself  with the neopositivist movement newly transplanted to America and serving as one of  the  advisory  editors  to  the International  Encyclopedia  of Unified Science founded by Neurath in 1938.\n\nMarty (1847-1914) was a native  of  Switzerland  who, following the example of his teacher Brentano in Wiirzburg, took  holy  orders in  1870.  He was  professor, successively, in Czernowitz  and  Prague,  and  was responsible  for  applying Brentano's  ideas in the areas of  linguistics and the philosophy of language,  where  his  writings  anticipated  a  number  of aspects of contemporary work on linguistic universals. Marty played a role also in the early developmentofBrentanian ideas on language in the direction of a theory of  speech acts, 34  and exerted an influence in  this  respect both on Buhler and his followers in Vienna and also on  Jakobson and other members of  the Prague linguistic circle.\n\nThe philosophical atmosphere in Prague in the first decades of the twentieth century had of  course been determined to no small extent by the work of physicists such as Mach, Einstein and Frank. Yet it is clear that Marty, Stumpf, Ehrenfels and other Breritanians as  well as phenomenologically-oriented psychologists  such  as  Ewald  Hering  played  a  no  less important  role  in  determining  the  scientific  orientation  of Prague  philosophy.  Moreover,  whilst  the  two  groups  were doctrinally  at  loggerheads,  particularly  over  the  theory  of relativity  itself,  which  Brentano  charged  with  incoherence, there  were  examples  Of  amicable  collaboration  across  this doctrinal divide: Thus Einstein was to be a,  life-long friend of Wertheimer, 35  and also of  Marty's  student and assistant Hugo Bergmann, who was in tum  a close friend of  Franz Kafka and had  done  much  to  encourage  the  latter  to  attend  the philosophy lectures ofEhrenfels, Marty and other Brentanists as part  of  his studies in the German University. Bergmann had also initiated Kafka·  into the mysteries of  the already mentioned Brentanist discussion group in Prague. Initially, as Bergmann writes, the group had\n\ncalled itself:the 'Louvre  Circle'  after the Louvre coffeehouse where we used to gather. Later on, we got together in the drawing-room of  my then mother-in-law, Berta Sohr-Fanta, where Einstein was a frequent visitor when we were reading Hegel's  'Phenomenology  of  the Spirit'. I scarcely remember whether Einstein  took  part in  these  readings.  Yet  I  well \" recall  a popular lecture he held before this .score of non› physicists  on  the  special  theory  of relativity.  (Bergmann, 1974, p.389)\n\nBergmann  himself was\\_ the  author of books  on  Brentano's concept of  evidence and on the philosophy ofBolzano, dealing especially with the latter's logic and philosophy of mathema› tics. On the other hand however he was the author of  a volume on The  Controversy  Concerning  the Law  of  Causality  in  Contem› porary  Physics, dedicated  'In memory  of my  teacher  Anfon Marty'  and described by Einstein in his Foreword to the book as 'promoting the best in our present-day attempts at merging physical and philosophical thought'. 36\n\nStumpf(l848-1936) was born in the village ofWiesentheid in  Lower  Franconia  (Bavaria)  from  where he  moved  to the University  of Wurzburg in  1865.  In  1866  he began  a close collaboration with Brentano which extended across the  period\n\n1866. to  1874 when Brentano left for Vienna. Stumpf himself was  professor  in  Wilrzburg  from  1873,  before  leaving  for Prague in  1879  and going on from  there to  Halle  in  1884, where he would serve for a time as  teacher and colleague of Husserl. After a period in Munich, Stumpf  was called in 1894 to serve as professor of philosophy in Berlin with the explicit task of establishing there an institute of psychology.  It was in this institute that his most important students and collaborators-Wertheimer, again, but  also Wolfgang Kohler, Kurt Koffka and Kurt Lewin would establish the so-called Berlin school of  Gestalt psychology.\n\nStumpfs influence on his Gestaltist students was  two-fold. On the one hand he gave them a rigorous training, especially in the  philosophical foundations of psychology 37  echoing in this respect the work of  his own teacher Brentano. And on the other hand he conveyed to them an understanding of and a respect for philosophy as a scientific enterprise in its own right -as  a science of the most general properties (both material and psychological) of  what is real. Philosophy therefore stands to  the physical and psychological sciences in much the same relation as, say, logic to the sciences of  language.\n\nThis  philosophical  background  was  indispensable  to  the initial  successes  of.  the  Gestaltist  enterprise  as  a  research programme in psychology. Indeed it seems quite generally to have been those thinkers who have had powerful convictions as to the importance of  philosophy as a discipline in its own right who have exerted the strongest influence on developments in science  proper,  as  contrasted  with,  say,  the  thinkers of the Vienna Circle, who saw philosophy as very much an inferior aid to science. The Vienna Circle has in fact given rise to almost no  truly  creative  developments  in  the  extra-philosophical sphere:  even  the early work of Godel seems  hardly to  have been affected by the efforts of  Schlick et al., and Gode!'s later philosophy  was,  notoriously,  closer  to  the  metaphysics  of a Leibniz or a Husserl than to the anti-metaphysical attitudes of his erstwhile Viennese contemporaries.\n\nThe  Stumpfian Naturphilosophie led  to  a  quite  particular concern  with  the  problem  of demarcation  of the  sciences, inspiring  Stumpfs student  Kurt  Lewin,  in  his  study of the different  concepts  of identity  presupposed by  the  different sciences, to develop the notion of  'genidentity'  for example of  two successive states of  a single organism or physical system\n\n-a notion which was then adopted by Carnap in his works in logic.  The  same  theme  of demarcation  of the  sciences  was taken up by Schlick in one of  his earliest philosophical writings (1910),  and the fact  that other early  publications of Schlick, too, are  devoted to markedly  Stumpfian  themes,  taken together with the respectful refeqences to Stumpf in Schlick's General Theory of  Knowledge, 38 may suggest that there was some influence  of  Stumpf  during  the  time  (1900-1904)  when Schlick  was  studying physics  in  Berlin.  This hypothesis is  to some extent supported by the fact that  the Berlin Philosophical Faculty was in those days still not  divided into separate faculties for the Naturand Geisteswissenschaften.\n\nPerhaps the clearest illustration of the close links between scientific philosophy in Berlin and Vienna is provided by the case of  the  Austrian novelist Robert Musil. Musil studied under Stumpf in Berlin from 1903 to 1908, writing his doctorate on the philosophy of  Mach.  39  He enjoyed friendly contacts in this period  with  Gestalt  psychologists  such  as  Kohler  and  von Allesch, and Gestaltist ideas make themselves felt at a number of places in Musil's novel The Man Without Qualities. Musil was indeed tempted, on completing his studies in Berlin, to accept an invitation from Meinong to serve as  his assistant in Graz. But he enjoyed contacts with the positivists, also, and particu› larly with Richard von Mises in whose home in Berlin he was a regular guest.\n\nN  eurath,  too,  studied  in  Berlin  in  the  early  years  of the century, and so also, from  1906 to 1908, did Ludwig Wittgen› stein. For our purposes here, however, it is the manifold links between the Berlin Gestalt theorists and a later generation of scientific  philosophers in  Berlin  that will  be  of importance. Thus we know that Kurt Lewin was involved with Carnap and Reichenbach in the earliest efforts to cultivate a tradition of scientific  philosophy  in  Germany,  and  both  he  and  Kohler actively  participated  in  the  discussions  of the  Reichenbach group  in Berlin. 40 Lewin's  paper  on  the  transition  from Aristotelian  to  Galilean  modes  of thought  in  biology  and psychology was published in the first volume of Erkenntnis, and a paper by Kohler on Boltzmann appeared in volume two of the same journal. Kohler's  book on Physical Gestalten at Rest and in  the  Stationary  State:  An  Investigation  in  Natural  Philosophy (  1920), an attempt to show that the Gestalt structures given in experience and in the world of  organic matter are present also\n\nin  the  purely  physical  realm,  was  greeted  by  many  of the neopositivists as a substantive contribution to  just that 'unity  of science'  which  they  themselves were  advocating  in  their philosophical writings.\n\nPositivist philosophy had until this time largely as a result of the efforts of Mach and his British empiricist predecessors -been associated with the doctrines of  elementarism, 1Vith the view that the ultimate constituents of  reality and of  experience are  'elements' or  'atoms'. Thus,  Carnap's  new  Viennese phenomenalism, too, started out from the view that reality can be understood as a 'meaningless  complex'  of  sensory elements, 41 a  development  that  was  stimulated  also  by  certain  logically atomistic  implications  of the  new  logic  of Whitehead  and Russell, as also by the work of  Wittgenstein. Carnap however, under the influence of  Wertheimer and Kohler, saw that there were reasons to reject this elementarist view. Thus he took as the basis of his system in The Logical Structure of  the  World not elements  but  necessarily  unanalysable  'instantaneous  total experiences' 42  (though the Gestaltists could rightly object that even this concession ignores the fact that our experiences are organised  structurally  not only  within  each  instant  but also across time). Ayer, too, was sensitive to the Gestaltist challenge, as  is  shown by  his  remark in Language,  Truth and Logic to the effect that 'our empiricism  is  not logically  dependent on an atomistic psychology, such as Hume and Mach adopted, but is compatible with any theory whatsoever concerning the actual characteristics of  our sensory fields' (  1936, p.122).  43\n\nA special role in the attempts by the Austro-German logical positivists  to  come to  terms with  the  Gestaltist challenge was played  by  a  series  of  papers  by  Kurt  Grelling  and  Paul Oppenheim, the first of which, on 'The  Concept of  Gestalt in the Light of Modern Logic' was published in volume seven of Erkenntnis in  1938. 44  The paper was  designed to defend the Gestaltist  position  against  (not  entirely  unjustified)  charges that much of the then current talk of psychological and other sorts of 'wholes not reducible to  the sums of their parts' was either  meaningless  or  inherently  confused.  The aim  of the paper was therefore 'to suggest definitions which accomplish the following: when the concepts thus determined are approp› riately  inserted into sentences which appear characteristic of the Gestalt theorists,  these sentences turn out neither trivial nor empty of  sense'. 45\n\n## Austrian Origins\n\nOppenheim was an example of  that rare breed, a philosophi› cally-minded banker, rich enough to pay philosophers to serve as  his  co-authors  in  a  series  of works  in  the  philosophy  of science published in the period 1938 to  1978. One of  the first such  ventures  was  his  paper  with  Grelling  on  Gestalt.  He collaborated also, inter alia, with Hempel a peculiar volume entitled The Concept of  Type in the Light of  Modern Logic (  1936), an analysis of the work on human typology of psychologists such as  Lewin,  Kretschmer,  and Jaensch  and  with  Nicholas Rescher again on the 'Logical  Analysis of  Gestalt Concepts' -as well as writing a series of  books and papers of  his own on the  demarcation  and  'natural order' of scientific  disciplines and on the 'static  and dynamic laws of  the formation of scientific concepts'. ·.\n\nHusserl  (1859-1938),  whose  unequalled  influence  on  the philosophy  of continental  Europe  in  the  twentieth  century needs  no  commentary,  was responsible  for  transforming Brentano's 'descriptive psychology' into  his  own  somewhat more  ambitious-sounding  enterprise  of  'phenomenology'. Like so  many others, Husserl was won for philosophy by the power of Brentano's  thinking and teaching. As he himself put it in 1932: 'Without  Brentano I should have written not  a single word of philosophy.'\n\nThe superficial view of the relations between phenomenology and  the logical  positivists  has  long centred around Carnap's attack in the second volume of Erkenntnis on the 'metaphysical  nonsense'  of  Heidegger's Sein und Zeit. Thus it  has been readily assumed that phenomenology as  a whole appeared to Carnap and his associates as just another example of  the  bad  old  metaphysics  which the Vienna  positivist movement  was  out  to  vanquish. 46 The  two  camps  were, certainly, at odds with each other in central points of  doctrine. Thus  it  was  the  phenomenologist  Roman  Ingarden  who presented one of the  first  formulations  of the now  familiar criticism of  the Vienna circle verifiability criterion of  meaning -that the criterion is itself meaningless by its own lights at the  Prague World  Congress  of Philosophy in  1934. 47  When one look~ more  closely,  however,  one  sees  that  there  are  a number of respects in which Schlick and his circle were influ› enced by  Husserl's phenomenology, even if only in the sense that, as in the case of  the Gestaltist movement, phenomenology provided  a  substantive  and  influential  group  of problems\n\nwhich the positivists felt called upon to solve (or at least to do away with, by whatever means).\n\nAs has often been noted, the very project of  phenomenology . -the project  of  basing  philosophy  on  a  painstakingly ~~eq~ate description of  what is given in experience precisely as 1t 1s  given can be regarded simply as a more comprehensive and radical version of  phenomenalism in the traditional sense, so th~t Hermann Liibbe,  for example, finds  no difficulty in assertmg  that  'Ernst  Mach  and  other  critical  empiricists, regardless  of their  \"positivism\",  belong  in  the  tradition  of phenomenology'. 48 The  two  strands  of  Austrian  positivist philosophy were indeed at one stage so closely intertwined that Husserl could be considered as a potential successor to Mach in the chair  in Vienna. 49 Guido  Kung, more  recently, has defended  the  view  that  there  are  quite  specific  parallels between Husserlian phenomenology and the project of  'expli› cation'  that is defended by Carnap in his The Logical Structure of the  World. A view of this sort was indeed advanced already in 1932 by Ernst Polak, a student of  Schlick in Vienna, in a clearly Wittgenstein-inspired dissertation entitled Critique of Phenomenology by Means of  Logic. The sense of  phenomenology, according  to  Polak,  'is logic  (grammar  in  the  most  general sense), clarification of  what we mean when we speak; its results are tautologies;  its  findings  not statements,  but explications' (1932, p.157).\n\nAs is seen from Wittgenstein's  own repeated employment of the  terminology  of  'phenomenology', particularly  around 1929, it is primarily in regard to the problem of  the synthetic a priori, of an  'intermediary between  logic  and  physics',  that Husserl's thinking is  crucial  to  the development of Austrian positivi~m. Husserl's account of the synthetic a  priori is indeed no less important to the Vienna circle than that of Kant,  50  for where K~nt sees th~ realm of  the synthetic a  priori as residing in the relauvely restncted and practically inaccessible sphere of transcendental  consciousness,  Husserl  claims  that there  is  a directly  accessible a priori dimension  in  the  entire  range of everyday experience so that vastly more propositions turn out to be synthetic and a  priori on Husserl's  view than on that of Kant, including such homely examples as 'nothing  can be both red and green all over'  to which the logical positivists devoted a gre~~ ~ea! of their attentions. 51 From the standpoint of the pos1t1V1sts, of  course, synthetic a  priori propositions do not and\n\n56.\n\ncannot exist: all true propositions are either tautologies oflogic or  contingent  truths  relating  to  matters  of fact.  From  the Husserlian perspective, in contrast, there are entire disciplines of  synthetic a  priori truths, including the discipline of phenomenology- and it is fascinating to observe the extent to which the positivists are driven to unsupported claims as to the 'logical'  character of Husserl's theses in the face  of the quite evidently extra-logical or 'material'  character of  his examples.\n\n## Brentano and scientific philosophy\n\nOur conclusion, then, is  that European logical positivism is a part of the  exact philosophical. heritage  of Brentano.  More specifically, it is a reflection of  the interplay of  the intellectual and institutional  influence  of Brentano and his  school with developments  in  logic  and  in  the  philosophy  of  physics inspired  by  Russell  and  Wittgenstein  and  by  Mach  and  his successors in Vienna and Prague.\n\nWhat, precisely, are the implications of  a view of  this sort? It suggests  first  of all  as  I  hope  has  become clear from  the foregoing that one needs to look again, and more closely, at the  relationship between logical  positivism on the one hand and Gestalt theory and phenomenology on the other. But still more importantly it suggests that there may be benefits to be gained from the examination of  Brentano's  own conception of philosophy and of  its relations to the different sciences.\n\nBrentano  is,  clearly,  a  somewhat  paradoxical  figure.  We have  already  referred  above  to  Kurt  Lewin's paper on  the transition from 'Aristotelian'  to 'Galilean'  modes of  thought in modern science. This paper is an echo of  a much earlier piece by Brentano  entitled  'Auguste  Comte and  the Positive Philosophy', 52  in which Brentano expounds Comte's doctrine of the 'phases'  of philosophical development from the fictive and anthropomorphic thinking of theological and metaphysical  philosophy  to  the  scientific  thinking  of  that modern  'positive' philosophy  which  seeks  to  establish  the 'general  laws governing the connections between  facts'. Brentano had already three years earlier set forth the funda› mental elements of this  scientific mode of philosophising very much in. the spirit of Comte in the twenty-five 'Habili› tation Theses' which he defended in Wiirzburg in 1866. The\n\nmost influential of these theses, which was chosen by Richard von Mises as a motto for his textbook on positivism, reads as follows:  'Vera philosophiae methodus nulla alia nisi scientiae naturalis est.' (The true method of philosophy is  none other than that of  the natural sciences.) 53  Brentano held indeed that the  method  of the  natural  sciences  is  common  to  all  the sciences, so that he is, in this respect at  least, an advocate of  the unity  of science.  Thus also  he  is  critical  of the  view  of the German philosopher Wilhelm Dilthey according to which the so-called Geisteswissenschaften or  human  or  moral  sciences would somehow call for a special method of  understanding or Verstehen, as·  opposed  to  the  'explanation' of  the  natural sciences.\n\nThe first of Brentano's  theses is a repudiation of  (German) metaphysics as a whole:\n\nPhilosophia neget  oportet; scientias in speculativas et exactas dividi posse; qilod si non recte negaretur, esse earn ipsam jus non esset (Philosophy must protest against the division of the sciences into the speculative and the exact, and the justification of this protest is what  justifies its own existence), a view which sits neatly- and bravely-alongside the second thesis:\n\nPhilosophia  et  eos,  qui  earn  prmc1p1a  sua  a  Theologia sumere  volunt,  et eos  rejicere  debet,  qui,  nisi  sit  super› naturalis  revelatio,  earn  omnem operam  perdere conten› dunt. (Philosophy must protest against the presumption of taking its principles from theology and against the assertion that  it  is  only  through  the  existence  of a  supernatural revelation that a fruitful philosophy becomes possible.)\n\nBrentano in fact went so far as to protest against the view that universities  should  contain  faculties  of  theology,  precisely because theology cannot live  up to  the standards of science proper.\n\nWhat, then, were these standards? Briefly, we can say that Brentano  was  an  empiricist  in  the  Aristolelian  sense.  The thirteenth of  his theses reads: 'Nihil  est in intellectu, quod non prius fuerit in sensu, nisi  intellectus ipse.' (Nothing is  in the\n\n.\n\nintellect  which.  was  not  previously  in  the  senses,  except  the intellect itself.) 54 It is in this sense that  we are to understand the title ofBrentano's  masterpiece, the Psychology from an Empi,rical Standpoint of 1874.  Brentano took  empiricism  to ~mp.Iy th~t there are in fact  two  sources of knowledge:  what 1s  given m intuition, i.e. in outer and inner perception, and what is given through  the  logical  analysis  of concepts.  Most  importantly, however, he differed from empiricists sµch as Hume or Mach, in  his  belief that  truly scientific  knowledge,  a  knowledge of general laws, is possible on these two pillars as basis.\n\nScientific  induction  is understood  by  Brentano  as the process of establishing general laws  starting from  the ?bser› vation of particular facts as  opposed to that other kmd of induction which attempts to use given particular facts merely as a starting point for predicting other particular facts. Scien› tific induction is  therefore not, as it was for Hume and Mach, a matter  of habit.  The  intuition  of lines  and  points,  and  of ourselves as intuiters of  lines and points; gives us knowledge of the concepts of geometry. The combination of this intuiµon with  processes  of  deductive  reasonin?  may  then  lead  t? evident,  insightful  laws  in  the  geometncal  sphere.  And this same combination ofintuition and deduction can be employed to yield the basic concepts and associated evident laws also in qther spheres of sci~ntific investig~tio~ ..  But it is  necessary t? start in each case with a mode of mtmt1ve knowledge that is predsely appropriate to the relevant objects of.investig~tion, just as  they are given in experience. Brentano 1s  accordmgly opposed,  in  his  understanding  of  the  properly  scientific method, to the attitude of  reductionism so characteristic of  the later positivist proponents of physicalism and related doctrines.\n\nOne might, now, be tempted to suppose that Brentano's  talk of 'intuition',  'evidence'  or 'insightfulness'  is  entirely alien to the  tradition of Viennese positivism.  Many of the positivists' critical writings are indeed devoted to the attempted refutation of claims  made on behalf of intuition as a means of gaining knowledge  in  favour  of the  (public,  scientific,  repeatable) 'observation'  for  which  the  positivists  themselves  had opted. Schlick, too, in chapter two of  his General Theory of  Knowledge, criticises  what  he  takes  to  be  Brentano's (and  Stumpfs and Husserl's) views concerning  intuition and evidence. If, however,  one looks  more  closely  at  Schlick's own  theory  of\n\n'observation statements', one  discovers  that  he  has  himself presupposed precisely the views that he had earlier criticised.  55\n\nFor  Schlick,  in  contrast  to  a  relativist  such  as  Neurath, believes that there are foundations for knowledge, that is, that there are statements which are self-evident, i.e.  not such as to derive their evidence from some other sphere. The process of understanding such statements is therefore 'at the same time the  process  of verifying them;  I  grasp their meaning at the same time as I grasp their truth'. 56  Such observation statements are therefore like simple tautologies in that our knowledge of their truth is immediate, so that there is no room for our being deceived. But they differ from tautologies in that they supply us with 'genuine  knowledge of  reality'.\n\nSchlick's  own preferred example of  an observation statement is  '[There  is]  yellow here now'. As Chisholm points out however, if this statement is  to be immune to deception then it can involve noreference to any external yellow sens  um, but must involve  reference only to  our own  present way  of experiencing,  so  that  it  might  best  be  rendered  'I  am› appeared-to-yellowly'. But now, as Chisholm shows, this is  to imply that Schlick's observation statements belong to the class of statements expressing experiences which are immediately evident in precisely the Brentanian sense.\n\nThe Brentanian method of intuition and deduction is, be it noted, prior to experimentation in the familiar sense. Brentano held that, while  experimentation may occasionally lead to new or more adequate intuitions, it must none the less be the case that a properly experimental science can arise only when  its  basic  concepts  and  laws  have  been  established  by intuition and deduction in tlie way suggested. For the experi› mental scientist who has not first established the nature of  the entities with which he deals is in a certain sense experimenting in  the  dark.  Measurement for  measurement's sake  and  the blind  formulation  of purely  functional  correlations  may,  by accident, lead  to predictions of future particular facts.  But it cannot  lead  to  the  kind  of deductive  luminosity  which,  as Brentano  insisted,  is  the  hallmark  of a  scientific  law  in  the fullest sense.\n\nThere is  of course  much  in  the above  brief statement of Brentano's position  that  is  in  need  of further  clarification. What has  been said should  however suffice  to establish one central  feature  of  Brentano's  thinking, namely  his  high\n\n60\n\nestimation of  the importance and of  the powers of  science- to the extent that he saw science as embracing philosophy itself  as a proper part. And it is perhaps this vision of  the great unita? edifice of science which did most to colour the thought of his Austrian successors.\n\n## Notes\n\n- l. I  should  like  to  thank  Heiner  Rutte,  Karl  Schuhmann, Peter Simons, Jan Wolenski and also the editor for helpful comments on an earlier version of  this paper. . .\n2.  While  Vienna and  Budapest were  the  twm Imperial-and-Royal (k.u.k.) capitals of the Habsburg Empire as a who!~, the ruler of the non-Hungarian Imperial-Royal (k.~.) part ~f the Empire ~as at one and the same time Emperor of Austna and Kmg of Bohemia.\n3. 3 These were often dedicated to  no  one single  area of interest, refl~cting the unofficial ~nterdis~iplinary  et~os of  Austrian uni.ver~ity education in the period m question (See Smith 1981 for some md1ca› tions of the workings of  this ethos in the speci~c case of K,afka)\n4.  See, again, Smith 1981, which also contams \\_some d1scuss1on ~f the  ways  in  which  Brentanian  ideas  may  have  mfluenced  Kafka s writings.\n5.  See Haller and Rutte, 1977, p. 25. . . . 6.  Another native Austrian who deserves mention m  this connection might be Edmund Husserl'.  author inter alia of impor~ant early  works  in  the  philosophy\\_ of logic ~nd lai:guage.  ?ne might mention also Hayek, himself  a d1st~nt cousm ?fW1t.t~enstem, who was the author not only of now familiar works m po~1t1cal economy but also  of a  Mach-inspired  treatise  on  the  foundations  of psycholo~y (1952a: the initial draft dates from arou.nd 1~20), as also ofa work m the  history  and  philosophy  of the  sooal  sciences (~ 952b).  ?r one might mention the Hungarian philosoph~r .a.nd  sooal theonst Karl Mannheim,  regarded  by  many  as  the  m1t1ator  of  the  so-called 'sociology  of knowledge'. , . . .\n8.  This thesis can be extended, with a pmch of  salt, even to th~ case of Frege, whose importance for logi~ was in no small part established through the mediation ofWittgenstem (as also, of  course, through the work of Russell,  Carnap, and others).  The thesis \\_applies also to  the case  of Hermann  Wey!,  whose  philosophy of science  was  strongly influenced  by  the  work  of  Husserl,  and Reichenb~ch.' too,  was  a student of Husserl  in  the  period  1914-15. \\_The  thmkmg\\_ of other German philosophers in  the area of the philos~phy of soence, for example that of Wilhelm Ostwald or o~ N  atorp, Rickert and the lesser Neo-Kantians  has, in contrast, been nghtly forgotten.\n7. For a bibliography of Flecks \"'.ntmg~ see Schnelle, 1982.\n9.  A compl~te list of  the publications of  the circle is given in S~ulez, pp. 346f, which also contains other useful supplementary matenal on\n\n61\n\nthe wider Austrian background of the Vienna positivists.\n\n10. ]. C.  Nyiri has indeed argued that there is a conservative and tra~itionalist cl!rrent  running  through the whole of  Austrian philosophy of saence. See his 1986.\n11.  See Neurath, 1973; esp. chs.5, 8 and 11.\n3. 1.2  ..  on Schlick's political  opinions see,  again,  the  interview with Hemnch Neider:\n4. Schlick was a man who had no sympathy at all for politics and the state; he w~s a liberal in \\_the old sense, for whom the fire brigade and the pohce were admitted as at best a necessary evil. Otherwise one did not need the state at all. (Haller and Rutte, 1977, p. 24)\n13.  See especially his just-mentioned essay of 1986, by which the present paper has been heavily influenced.\n14. Ny!ri,  1986, p.  143.\n\n.\n\n15.  See.  Haller, 19~6, and the references there given.\n17.  K. ~:Reinhold, on ~he other hand, was an Austrian renegade metaphysman who fled Vienna for Weimar. (What is said in the text should  not,  of cours~, be  taken  to  imply  that  there  is  a complete absence  of metaphysical  system-building  in  Austria  (or  indeed in England  and  Scotland):  system-builders  of  the  worst  and  most unreadable kind have indeed come to dominate in the University of Vienna itself in recent decades.)\n3. . 16: ~eiler, 1986,  1s  a strong statement of this  thesis,  and of its 1mphcauons  for  a?  .1-!nderstanding of the  peculiarities of Austrian philosophy. For cntiasms of  the thesis see Grassl and Smith, 1986.\n18.  See Grassl, 1986, for further references.\n\n,\n\n19.  Neurath,  1973,  p.  303.  A comprehensive  discussion  of this aspect  of the de~elopmertt of positivism  in  Austria  is  provided  by Stadler, 1982, which deals also with the social and political attitudes of Mach.\n20.  Menger's 'exact method' in  economics  in  fact  manifests  a number of parallels to ~he method of Franz Brentano in philosophy, and ther~ were  considerable  reciprocal  influences  between  the Menger arcle on the one hand and the Brentano school on the other. See the papers collected in Grassl and Smith (eds.), 1986.\n21.  The vo.lu~e in q~es.tion is  a collection  of Mill's writings  on female emanapat10n, socrahsm and Plato. It  is worth mentioning here also th.at Brenta?o was no less .r~sponsi?I~ \\_tha?  Mach ~or  th~ strong reception of t~e  1d~as of  the BntISh empmasts m Austria. Th1sis seen for e~ample m his  ?wn  w?rk on  Reid,  and  on  the  psychology  of Hamilton and the Mills, Bam and Spencer; and it is seen also in the work of Meinong on Hume or in the work of Husserl on Locke and Berkeley.\n22. T~e  Philoso~hical Society published also Hi)fler's Prefaces and Introductions to Classical Works on Mechanics (189.9), as well as works of Bolzano (edited by Hofler in 1914 and by Hahn in 1921).\n23.  See especially section 3  of  Carnap, 1928.\n24.  More than 100 pages of  his On Knowledge (1925) are devoted to\n7. a critique of Kant entitled 'Down With Prejudices! A  Warning to the Present in the Spirit of Bacon and Descartes to Free Itself from All Blind A Priori'.\n25.  Compare also Rutte, 1977, and Bergmann; 1967, esp. pp  ..  4ff.\n26.  Collected as  Haller,  1979; see also his  1981  and the (in&gt;many .respects definitive) essay of 1986.\n27.  Further  details of  Brentano's  life are given in ch. I  of Rancurello, 1968.\n28. It is  for this reason that it is  preferable to speak not of  'Bren› tanian  philosophy' but of 'Brentano-inspired philosophy' or of the 'descendants'  and 'heirs'  of Brentano.\n29.  Twardowski's move to Lemlierg is significant: in Lemberg, 'as in Cracow, under liberal Austrian rule,  Poles were allowed to go to their own  universities  and  to  be  taught by their own  lecturers and professors,  while  in  other  parts  of partitioned  Poland  they  were engaged in a most savage struggle for national and economic survival' (Jordan,  1945,  p.  39:  this  passage  not included in the  reprint). On Twardowski's thought and influence,~especially in the field of logic, see Dambska, 1978.\n30.  Fleck's  relations to Polish Bre.ntanism have recently been made the object of  a special study by Thomas Schnelle, 1982.\n31.  Ajdukiewicz studied with  Husserl in Gottingen from  1912 to 1914.\n32.  Carnap, 1963, p. 31.\n33.  On the early history and philosophy of  Gestalt psychology, see Smith (ed.), 1987.\n34.  See Smith 1984 and also the papers collected in Mulligan (ed.), forthcoming.\n35.  The two were colleagues in Berlin and retained their contacts when  both  had  emigrated  to  America.  See  the  chapter  'Albert Einstein and Max Wertheimer: A Gestalt Psychologist's View of the Genesis of the Special Relativity Theory'  in Miller,  1984. All four of the Berlin Gestalt psychologists Wertheimer, Kohler, Koffka and Lewin had an interest in physics.\n36.  Bergmann, 1929, p  .. 395 of  translation.\n37.  See Ash,  1982, pp.  30-62 for an extensive treatment of this matter, and of  the political machinations in favour of  the new 'scien› tific philosophy'  which led to Stumpfs appointment in Berlin.\n38.  See Schlick, 1925, pp. 23, 154, 157, 373 of  the translation.\n39.  See Musil, 1908; the work is highly critical of  Mach in particular and of positivistic philosophy of  science in general, so that it would be wrong to describe Musil himself  as an advocate of  positivist ideas: see Mulligan and Smith, 1987.\n40.  Carnap, 1963, pp.  14, 30.\n\n.\n\n41.  Thus Koffka could write at the close of his Principles of  Gestalt Psychology:\n\nIf there is any polemical spirit in this book, it is directed not against persons but against a strong cultural force .in  our present civili› sation for which I have chosen the name positivism. If positivism\n\n63\n\n,\":\n\n\\\n\ncan be regarded as an integrative philosophy, its integration rests on th~ dogma that all events are equally unintelligible, irrational, meamngl.ess'. pu~ely  f~ctual\". Such an integration is, however, to my way of thmkmg, 1dent1cal with a complete disintegration. (Koffka, 1935,pp.684£)\n\n42.  See Carnap, 1963, p. 16, and compare his 1928, pp. 109, 122 of the translation. ·\n43.  A  similar thesis as to the compatibility of  positivism and Gestalt theory was defended also by R.  von Mises,  1939, ch.22. The Gestalt problem  played ~ important  role in the  thinking  of  Gustav Bergmann, as also m the workofEino Kaila (see his 1979), a Finnish thinker who is one of  the four foreign philosophers (neither Austrian nor  German)  mention,ed  in  the  Appendix  to  the Wissenschaftliche Weltauffassung as 'sympathetic  to the Vienna circle'  or to the 'scientific world-conception'. ·\n44.  The remaining two papers 'Logical  Analysis of  \"Gestalt\" as \"Functional Whole\"', and 'A Logical  Theory of Dependence' were scheduled to appear in volume 9 of Erlunntnis in  1939  an issue not distr!buted due to war conditions. These two papers, tog°ether  with an E.nglish  translation of the earlier work and a commentary by P.  M. Simons, have now been published in Smith (ed.), 1987.\n45.  Grelling and Oppenheim, 1938, p. 211.\n\n•\n\n46.  This point of  view is belied, at least to some extent, by the fact that Carnap, having earlier studied under Frege in Jena, participated for a term in Husser\\_1's seminar in Freiburg, before going to Vienna in 1925  at the suggestion of Schlick.  He was  later invited by Frank to come to Prague, where he held a chair  in 'natural  philosophy'  for four years from 1931.\n47.  See Ingarden, 1936.\n48.  Liibbe, 1960,  p.  91  of translation.  The.  affinities  between Machian positivism and early phenomenology are illustrated clearly by  the  case  of Alexander  Pfander,  senior  member of the  Munich school  of phenomenologists, whose  early thinking is  heavily influ› enced by that of Mach.\n49.  Sommer, 1985, p. 13.\n\n.\n\n50.  On Wittgens~~i~ and phenomenology in general, see Spiegel› berg, 1968. On pos1t1V1sm,  Husserl and the a  frriori, see Delius, 1963, ch.I, and  also  Visser,  1979.  Smith,  1986,  contains a more  detailed elaboration of  the early Husserlian notion of  the a  frriori. .\n51.  Such examples were drawn, too, from the domain  of economics,  as  is  s?own  above  all  by  the  writings  on  economic methodology of Felix Kaufmann (for example his 1937). Kaufmann, a devo!ee o~ Husserl ~ho belonged to the fringes of  both the Schlick and Mises circles, published not only on the foundations of  economics and on the philosophy oflaw and mathematics, but also on the found› .  ations of  science in general.\n52.  See Brentano,  1869. Brentano's piece itself echoes J.  S.  Mill's Auguste  Comte  and Positivism of 1865,  and  Brentano laments at the beginning of the work the extent to which the new ideas. of positive\n\nphilosophy developed in France and England had remained almost unnoticed by his German contemporaries. ~\n\n53.  This is thesis IV. See Brentano, 1929, pp. 137ff.\n54.  The caveat 'nisi  intellectus ipse'  wafadded by Leibniz.\n55.  My  present  remarks  are  indebted  to  Chisholm's important study of  Schlick and Brentano, published in 1982. c\n56.

This  philosophical progression  can be  seen  in  the  way  logical  positivism  in  the philosophy of  science has developed in the last fifty years into a philosophical reaction back to all kinds of metaphysics: about realism,  about  natural  kinds,  about  causes,  about  laws  and necessity.\n\nDuring that time, Professor Ayer has been properly critical of the more extravagant metaphysical fashions. While modifying several of his radical theses in Language, Truth and Logic, he has remained reasonable, dear and full of  good sense in  his  subsequent  discussions  of problems  in  philosophy  of science. His problems  have  been  technical  philosopher's problems rather than those of  science itself. In the last sentence of LTL he says that the philosopher 'must  become a scientist'  in 'deploying the logical  relationships  of these  hypotheses and defining the symbols which occur in them ... if he is to make any  substantial  contribution  towards  the  growth ·Of human knowledge'  . 1 Later, however, he has come to treat philosophical problems as independent of those of  the special sciences.\n\nIn this paper I shall therefore talk as much aboutLTL and its structure  and  influence  as  about  its  author's later  work  in philosophy of  science. But first let me say something about the\n\n69",
