The  Subtle  Doctor's  concepts  and  doctrines  set  the  shape  of  much  of the  discussions  of  the  time,  on  the  nature  and  subject  of  metaphysics, on the freedom of the will, and on the principles of morality. More precisely, Scotus's de fi nition of being qua being as that to which being is not repugnant ( cui non repugnat esse ),  and as a possible being, left a twofold $^{1} legacy to later philosophy: on the one hand, his conception of metaphysics  as  a  transcendental science of the univocal concept of being, and on the other hand the centrality of the notion of freedom, whose fi rst manifestation  is  the  contingency  of  the  world  order.  During  the  Renaissance and  early  modern  period,  those  who  would  qualify  as  Scotists  were  so many that the Cistercian Juán Caramuel Lobkowitz could claim that Scoti schola numerosior est aliis simul sumptis (the school of Scotus counts more than all the other schools taken together).  Not only was the institutional $^{2} authority of Scotus uncontroversial but his thought also exercised a more di fused  in f fl uence.  Jesuit  philosophy  and  theology  was  undoubtedly  the main channel of di fusion for Scotus's  thought  in  the  early  modern  era, f and this, despite the fact that the ratio studiorum of  the  order (1586-99) made  the  study  of  Thomas  Aquinas's  doctrine  the  basis  of  their  theological teaching.  Especially well known is the importance of the Scotist $^{3}\n\n$^{1} See  John  Duns  Scotus, Quodl .  q.  3,  n.  2,  ed.  L.  Wadding  (Lyon:  1639),  XII,  67;  trans. F. Alluntis and A. Wolter, God and Creatures: The Quodlibetal Questions (Princeton: 1975), 61.  Honnefelder, Duns  Scotus (Munich:  2005)  clearly  states  the  twofold  motivation  that underlies Scotus's thought. On Scotus's metaphysics, see L. Honnefelder, Scientia transcendens: Die formale Bestimmtheit der Seiendheit und Realität in der Metaphysik des Mittelalters und der Neuzeit (Duns Scotus, Suárez, Wol f, Kant, Peirce) f (Hamburg: 1990).\n\n$^{3} For a historical justi fi cation of this claim, see J.

He is admittedly one of 'Scotus's intellectual descendants.'  However, the impact of Scotus on the latter is more $^{5} limited in scope and more problematic than with some of his famous fellow Jesuits, like Suárez and Gabriel Vázquez (1549-1604). Indeed, Molina's intellectual production (at least in its extant state) ranges over fewer topics than that of the Doctor eximius .  In particular, the nature of the object of  metaphysics and the discussion of eternal truths and divine ideas do not fi gure among Molina's chief preoccupations. In contrast to this, and somewhat unsurprisingly in the context of post-Tridentine theology, the discussion of the nature of free will and its reconciliation with God's foreknowledge, providence, and predestination is where Scotus's in fl uence on Molina proves most important.  The controversies $^{6} de auxiliis that  arose in reaction to Molina's teachings on grace and predestination in the Concordia provide  evidence  of  an  (at  least  tactical)  proximity  between  the Jesuits and the Franciscans against the Dominicans.  There are thus his$^{7} torical a ffi nities between o ffi cial Scotists and Molinists. But in this chapter  I  will  try  to  give  a  philosophical  assessment  of  the  relation  between Scotus  and  Molina.  Here,  the  notion  of  in fl uence should be understood\n\n$^{4} See  Honnefelder, Scientia  transcendens .  Scotus's  account  of  broadly  logical  modality  (possible  logicum)  constitutes  the  background  of  all  17th-century  discussion  about the divine foundation of modality and the source of eternal truths and about the nature of  possible  beings.  See  T.  Ho fmann,  Creatura  intellecta: f Die  Ideen  und  Possibilien  bei Duns Scotus mit Ausblick auf Franz von Mayronis, Poncius und Mastrius (BGPTM, NF) 60 (Munster:  2002);  J.  Coombs,  'The  Ontological  Source  of  Logical  Possibility  in  Catholic Second Scholasticism,' in The Medieval Heritage in Early Modern Metaphysics and Modal Theory, 1400-1700 ,  ed.  R.

Recherches  philosophiques  et  textuelles  sur  la  métaphysique jésuite, 1540-1767' (Doctoral Diss., EPHE-ULB: 2003).\n\n$^{6} Some of Scotus's meta-ethical doctrines on the foundation of natural law do play a role in Molina's other master work, the De iustitia et iure ,  but  for  lack  of  space,  we  shall not treat it here. See I. Mandrella, Das Isaak-Opfer: historisch-systematische Untersuchung zu Rationalität und Wandelbarkeit des Naturrechts in der mittelalterlichen Lehre vom natürlichen Gesetz (BGPTM NF) 62 (Munster: 2002), on the problem of divine dispensation of natural law for which Isaac's sacri fi ce is the case study.\n\n$^{5} The phrase is borrowed from D.C. Langston, God's Willing Knowledge: The In luence of f Scotus' Analysis of Omniscience (University Park: 1986), at 53. There are not so many studies explicitly devoted to the question of Molina's relation to Scotus. E. Dekker is an exception; see his two papers 'The Reception of Scotus' Theory of Contingency in Molina and Suarez,' in Via Scoti. Methodologica ad mentem Ioannis Duns Scoti , ed. L. Sileo (Rome: 1995), 445-54 and 'Does Scotus Need Molina? On Divine Foreknowledge and Co-Causality,' in John Duns Scotus, Renewal of Philosophy , ed. E.P. Bos (Atlanta: 1998), 101-11.\n\n$^{7} See J. Schmutz, 'L'héritage des subtils,' 68.\n\nso as to include the conceptual frameworks, the explicit theses, and the more general  (and  less  easily  discernible)  philosophical  outlooks  which display  either  a  positive  or  a  negative  impact  of  Scotus  on  Molina. $^{8} In what follows, I will try to diagnose such an in fl uence on two speci fi c and closely  related  topics:  the  metaphysics  of  free  will  and  the  problem  of divine  foreknowledge.   The $^{9} fi rst  part  of  this  study  provides  a  sketch  of Scotus's theory (sections 1 to 7). In the second part (sections 8 to 13), the results  of  the fi rst  are  confronted  to  Molina's  criticisms  and  to  his  own doctrines.  Finally,  I  will  end  this  conclusion  by  retrospectively  showing how Scotus could be interpreted as reconciling God's foreknowledge and human freedom in a way consistent with Molinism (section 14).\n\nI\n\nThe idea of free will is absolutely central in order to understand Scotus's thought. According to him, the will is essentially a rational power, which means that it is not determined to a single e fect, but instead it is a power f of self-determination. The phrase 'rational power' is taken from Book IX of Aristotle's Metaphysics (1046b4-6), where they are opposed to irrational  powers,  whose  characteristic  feature  is  that  they  are  determined  to a  single  e fect.  For  instance,  given  appropriate  circumstances  (dryness f of  the  atmosphere,  etc.), fi re  burns  wood.  On  the  other  hand  a  rational power  is  such  that,  given  the  same  set  of  circumstances  it  can  either produce  a  given  e fect  or  not  produce  it.  But  Scotus  deeply  transforms f Aristotle's idea. Indeed, according to him, the purely cognitive faculties of\n\n$^{8} The purely historical question of Molina's exact knowledge of Scotus is not addressed here. From the explicit quotations, it appears that Molina knew and read the Ordinatio , especially  Book  I,  dist.  38-39.  I  will  refer  to  the  Vatican  edition:  Ioannes  Duns  Scotus, Opera omnia, studio et cura Commissionis Scotisticae ad fi dem codicum edita (Vatican City: 1950-), referred to as Vat., followed by volume and page number. Whether Molina knew the Quodlibetal Questions and the commentaries on Aristotle, and in particular the Questions on Metaphysics, is more dubious. The Lectura was unknown until its rediscovery by C. Balic in the 1920s. For this reason, I will mostly refer to the Ordinatio .\n\n$^{9} By  a  metaphysic  of  freedom,  I  mean  the  study  of  the  metaphysical  conditions necessary  to  ascribe  freedom  to  a  voluntary  agent,  setting  aside  the  psychological  considerations  that  any  agent  must  satisfy  in  order  to  be  endowed  with  a  will.  Scotus's considerations on free will are not restricted to the purely metaphysical notion of a power of self-determination, but also involve a moral psychological and a speci fi cally ethical perspective; see the texts in Part II of A. Wolter, Duns Scotus on the Will and Morality (1st ed. 1986; Washington: 1997). However Molina's own conceptions in moral psychology are too scattered and cursory to provide a su ffi ciently rich comparison point with Scotus.\n\n328\n\nmind, including the intellect, are irrational in this sense, and are accordingly natural powers ( potentiae naturales ). $^{1}$^{0} The will is the only rational power; it is not subject to causal determinism, and is the only cause of its decisions. $^{1}$^{1} This  involves  a  departure  from  the  Aristotelian  principle according to which every moving thing is moved by something else ( omne quod  movetur  ab  alio  movetur ). $^{1}$^{2} Within  the  Aristotelian  scheme,  only passive potencies (what would be called liabilities), which are unable to actualize by themselves a single e fect, are undetermined: a given piece of f bronze might be shaped as a statue or as a bowl. But according to Scotus, far from betraying an imperfection, the will's indetermination is the hallmark of its excellency, or what Scotus calls a 'superabundant su ffi ciency.' $^{1}$^{3} That  such  a  rational  power  escapes  causal  determinism  but  introduces 'fresh starts' in the causal order of the world is clearly stated by Scotus: 'I say that it is able to do what it does with no conceivable predetermination to act, so that the initial determination, both in the order of nature and in the order of time, occurs in the very placing of its act' ( Questions on Metaphysics , IX, q. 15, n. 66, 000, Will and Morality , 148). Or more brie fl y: 'there is  no  other  cause  [of  the  will's  willing  something  rather  than  something else] to be found except that the will is will' (ibid., n. 29, Will and Morality , 140). Free will is incompatible with causal determinism.\n\nThe existence of such a power of self-determination, and thus of a will, is an intuitive truth, something anyone can experience. $^{1}$^{4} Hence creatures like human beings enjoy free will. But the idea that the will 'could have\n\n$^{1}$^{0} Questions on Metaphysics , IX, q. 15, n. 20-41 ( Opera philosophica vol. III and IV) (New York: 1997), IV, 680-86. There is a clear and useful account of the issues discussed in this paragraph in M.B. Ingham and M. Dreyer, The Philosophical Vision of John Duns Scotus: An Introduction (Washington: 2004) and T. Ho fmann, 'The Distinction between Nature and f Will in Duns Scotus,' Archives d'Histoire Doctrinale et Littéraire 66 (1999): 189-224.\n\n$^{1}$^{2} See Scotus's discussion in Questions on Metaphysics , IX, q. 14, OP IV, 626-73.\n\n$^{1}$^{1} There is disagreement in Scotus scholarship on the respective role of will and intellect in the formation of a volition. Some texts say that intellect and will function as partial co-causes  of  the  volition  (see Lectura II,  d.  25,  q.  un.,  n.  73,  Vat.  XIX,  254),  while  other passages  ascribe  to  the  cognitive  representation  only  the  role  of  a causa  sine  qua  non , leaving  the  will  as  the  total  cause  of  the  volition  ( Rep .  II,  d.  25,  n.  22,  ed.  L.  Wadding [Lyon: 1639], VI, 888). Interpreters disagree over whether these textual di ferences express f a  change  of  opinion  (toward  a  more  radical  voluntarism)  or  not,  and  if  the  answer  to the fi rst  question  is  a ffi rmative,  whether  the  second  position  represents  a  later  stage  of Scotus's thought. For a recent, clear statement of the issue, see Ingham and Dreyer, The Philosophical Vision of John Duns Scotus , 162-72.\n\n$^{1}$^{3} Questions  on  Metaphysics ,  IX,  q.  15,  n.  31,  OP  II,  611, Will  and  Morality ,  140:  'est  et alia superabundantis su ffi cientiae, quae est ex illimitatione actualitatis, vel simpliciter vel quodammodo.'\n\n$^{1}$^{4} Questions on Metaphysics , IX, q. 15, n. 30, OP II, 610.\n\nacted  otherwise'  needs  some  clari fi cation.  Scotus  distinguishes  various senses under which one can be said to be able to will the opposite. First, one may be such that she can have contrary volitions related to the same object,  like  loving  something,  and  later  hating  it.  But  the  will  can  also will di ferent objects: someone who wants to drink may also want to eat. f The fi rst  is  a  power  for  contrary acts, the second is a freedom for di ferf ent objects. Only the latter is essential for freedom, and is found both in God and in creatures, because the former supposes some form of mutability,  which cannot be found in God. $^{1}$^{5} Scotus sets the same distinction in terms of the di ference between not willing ( f non velle ) and willing that not ( nolle ). Thus if I hate something, in some way I refuse it, which Scotus describes as an act of nolition ( nolle ).  But if I freely want to A ,  all  I  need in order to be free, is to be able not to will A .\n\nThere is another crucial distinction concerning the power to act otherwise.  It  can  signify  either  a  manifest  power  to  will  di ferent  acts  and/ f or objects successively, or what Scotus calls a 'not so evident power': the power not to will something at the very instant that one wills something, and vice versa. $^{1}$^{6} The fi rst power is evident: if I swim at some time, I am able to swim even if I am in now in the middle of the desert, provided one indexes the object of the power (i.e. swimming) to a later time than now. But in  order  to  be  free  to  swim,  I  should  have  the  power  to  swim  now, which  I  clearly  lack. $^{1}$^{7} Similarly,  for  my  will  to  be  free,  I  must  have  the power now to refrain from willing what I will. This is a clear consequence of  Scotus's  claim  that  free  will  is  incompatible  with  natural  necessity. $^{1}$^{8} Natural powers are such that given if their causal requisites are present, there is no power at time T for the opposite e fect. By contrast, the will as f a rational power has simultaneously the power to will the opposite or not to will anything at all. However, Scotus does not defend his position via this line of argumentation but instead uses the thought experiment of an angel existing for a single instant of time. This thought experiment allows\n\n$^{1}$^{5} Ord . I, d. 38, p. 2-d.39, q. 1-5 (= I, d.39), n. 15, Vat. VI, 417; n. 21, Vat. VI, 425-26.\n\n$^{1}$^{7} The double time indexing of powers to φ is essential to see how D. Langston is misled when he thinks that powers for Scotus are just abilities, not necessarily including opportunities. Having the power at T to φ at some time or another is enough for a mere ability. But when Scotus claims that freedom of action and/or will requires the power at T to φ at T , this entails that one has the power to φ given the circumstances, which requires that one has the opportunity to exercise the power.\n\n$^{1}$^{6} Ord .

II, 60 : 'Necessitas naturalis non stat cum libertate.'\n\nScotus to disprove any theory that grounds the contingency of an act at T on what happens at any earlier time. Suppose an angel elicits a sinful act. Since sinning requires freedom of the will, this entails that at this very instant, the angel must be able to avoid sinning at this very moment.\n\nII\n\nThe idea of a simultaneous power to will otherwise is only one aspect of a new modal framework which marks a clear departure from older modal paradigms, as Scotus scholars have largely insisted upon. The central feature  of  Scotus's  new  model  is  the  theory  of  synchronic  contingency.  He developed his thought largely in reaction to a form of determinism held by  those  whom  he  names  the  'Philosophers,'  who  promoted  a  broadly Aristotelian  account  of  modality. $^{1}$^{9} A  common  feature  of  these  thinkers was  their  adherence  to  a  version  of  the  Principle  of  Plenitude  (i.e.  no genuine  possibility  remains  unactualized),  which  entails  that  whatever is  eternal  and/or  immutable  is  (absolutely)  necessary.  One  line  of  argument which could lead to this was their strict notion that actualization of  any  potentiality  implies  a  process  of  change.  The  theory  entails  the necessity of the present, expressed by the Aristotelian dictum omne quod est,  necesse  est  esse  quando  est (everything  necessarily  is,  when  it  is, De interpretatione 19a23-27) which is then understood, not as an innocuous conditional  necessity,  but  as  a necessitas  consequentis :  'If A occurs  at T , then it is necessary (from T on) that A occurs at T .'\n\nSince  any  genuine  possible  state  of  a fairs  requires  that  some  actual f potency be able to bring it about, it follows that if some potency is immutable, then whatever results from it, necessarily does so. Therefore, if God is  eternal  and  immutable, then whatever he produces is necessary. As a consequence, contingency is only the result of the impedibility of causal chains relating the fi nite beings, which comes from the essential imperfection of secondary causes.\n\n$^{1}$^{9} Ord .  I,  d.  8,  p.  2,  q.  un,  n.  251-55,  Vat.  IV,  294-97.  On  Scotus's  new  theory  of  synchronic contingency and its impact on the whole modal theory, see S.

Normore,  'Duns  Scotus's  Modal  Theory,' in The Cambridge Companion to Scotus , ed. Th. Williams (Cambridge, Eng.: 2003), 129-60.\n\nAccording to Scotus, the latter position is incoherent, for either there is contingency within fi nites things, and so their fi rst cause has to be contingent,  or  God's  productive  action  is  necessary,  and  so  are  its  e fects. f $^{2}$^{0} The background principle of Scotus's fi rst argument is that necessity is a hereditary property: if E is  a  necessary e fect and f E is  a  cause  of E' ,  then E' is  necessary  too. $^{2}$^{1} The  contingency  of  God's  causation  (which  proves according to Scotus that he has will) is a necessary condition of the existence of contingent e fects within the world. Scotus adds two arguments f to  this  one.  The fi rst  is  based  on  the  superiority  of  the fi rst  cause  with respect to any caused event, and the other on the principle that the fi rst cause is able to produce alone any e fect produced by secondary causes. f $^{2}$^{2} Any  state  of  a fairs  that  is  contingent  with  respect  to  secondary  causes f does not cease to be so if it is directly brought about by the fi rst cause.\n\nSince the contingency of our world is a matter of fact, and this cannot consistently  be  denied,  it  follows  that  determinism  is  false. $^{2}$^{3} Moreover, since God acts through his will, and every will is essentially free, it follows that every created e fect is contingent and there is no absolute, but only f relative necessity in the realm of existing things other than God himself. $^{2}$^{4} Contingency is therefore absolutely universal on the one hand and, on the other, it has its root within God's will: 'the divine will is the fi rst ground ( prima ratio )  of  contingency' ( Rep .  I  A,  d.  39-40,  q.  1-3,  n.  35,  ed.  Söder, 248). This does not preclude that there might be other sources of contingency, namely the created wills. $^{2}$^{5}\n\n$^{2}$^{0} Ord .

See Reportatio IA, d. 39-40, n. 30, ed. in J. Söder, Kontingenz, and Wissen (BGPTM, NF) 49 (Munster: 1999), 247.\n\n$^{2}$^{5} Scotus's argumentation at Ord. I,  d.  39,  n.  14,  Vat.  VI,  416  relies  on the possibility of understanding the divine will as a source of contingency on the basis of an understanding of our own created will. This presupposes that the latter are also (limited) sources of contingency. Scotus is even more explicit in Rep. I A, d. 39-40, q. 1-3, n. 36, ed. Söder, 249: 'actus  voluntatis  meae  habet  duplicem causam contingentiae, unam ex parte voluntatis divinae sicut causae primae et aliam ex voluntate mea ut ex secunda causa.'\n\n$^{2}$^{4} Ord .

I A, d. 39-40, q. 1-3, n. 38, Söder, 249.\n\nBut  this  contingency  can  be  reconciled  with  God's  immutability  only if  one abandons the model of modality that goes along with the cosmology  criticized  by  Scotus.  In  particular,  he  gives  up  the  necessity  of  the Present. $^{2}$^{6} This  is  clearly  expressed  in  the  following de fi nition of contingency: 'I do not call contingent any non-necessary or non-permanent state of a fairs, but a state of a fairs whose opposite could occur while it occurs' f f ( Ord . I, d. 2, p. 1, q. 1-2 n. 86, Vat. II, 179). The theory of synchronic contingency cannot be separated from the rede fi nition of possibility in terms of logical possibility ( potentia logica ). Some state of a fairs is possible in this f sense if and only if its constitutive elements are nonrepugnant. However, this is never mere logical possibility, since every logical power is actually matched by a real power. And Scotus claims that the will as a real power accompanies the logical possibility of the contrary act. $^{2}$^{7} The  relation  of repugnance is not as strict as logical contradiction, but is closer to semantic incompatibility. For instance, the predicates 'red all over' and 'green all  over'  express  repugnant  properties,  though  their  combination  would not violate any law of logic. $^{2}$^{8}\n\nBy  de fi ning  the  will's  real  power  on  the  basis  of  the  logical  possibility of the two preceding states of a fairs, it might be thought that Scotus f dramatically weakens the 'could have willed otherwise' condition for free will,  in  a  way  that  is  compatible  with  a  compatibilist  conception.  Once again, my swimming now is in itself nonrepugnant, and thus constitutes a possible state of a fairs. All this can be interpreted as a matter of whether f one considers more or less fi ne-grained states of a fairs. If the time index f of the action envisaged and the causal requisites are speci fi ed, then there is indeed some repugnance. For instance, the state of a fairs expressed by f the sentence 'I am at T at a place where none of the conditions required to swim are present and I swim at T ' would be repugnant, and this entails that it is impossible that I swim on this occasion and that I am not free to do it. $^{2}$^{9}\n\n$^{2}$^{6} Restricting  the  latter  to  mere  conditional  necessity,  reinterpreting  the  Aristotelian principle in the following way: 'Necessarily (if A occurs at T , then A occurs at T ).'\n\n$^{2}$^{8} Lectura I, d. 2, p. 2, q. 1-4, n. 246.\n\n$^{2}$^{7} Ord .  I,  d.  39,  n.  16,  Vat.  VI,  418:  'hanc  etiam  potentiam  realem  activam . . . concomitatur potentia logica, quae est non-repugnantia terminorum. Voluntati enim ut actus primus,  non  repugnat  oppositum  velle.'  See Questions on Metaphysics ,  IX,  q.  1-2,  n.  18,  OP IV, 514.\n\n$^{2}$^{9} And so,  when  Scotus  claims  that  a  real  power  is  matched  by  a  logical  possibility, is  not  to  be  read  the  other way round as if the mere per se nonrepugnancy of a state of a fairs  entailed  that  the  agent  has  a  real  power.  To  get  a  real  power,  one  needs  to  add f an extrinsic nonrepugnancy with facts (already existing states of a fairs) to the intrinsic f\n\nThe theory of synchronic contingency must face the charge of violating the law of contradiction. If we suppose that p is true at t and that it is possible at t that p is false at t ,  then, by supposing the possible actualization of notp ,  that would entail that it is possibly true that p is  true at t and p is false at t which is contradictory. In order to avoid such a contradiction, Scotus uses the distinction between the composed and the divides sense. The sentence 'it is possible that S ,  not willing A at T ,  wills A at T ' is true in sensu divisionis but false in sensu composito .  The latter amounts to the contradiction: 'it is possible that ( S wills A at T and that S does not will A at T ).' But in the sense of division, it means that ' S does not will A at T and it is possible at T that S wills A at T ' which is not contradictory, provided one gives up belief in the necessity of the present, and true, since ' S wills that A at T ' is nonrepugnant. $^{3}$^{0} But Scotus goes further and distinguishes an order within the momentary existence of the angel during which he commits a sin. Being free, the sinning angel is able to refrain from sinning at T . However, his act occurs and thus becomes a matter of fact. From the point of view of the agent, the volition is contingent, because he has both the power to sin and the power not to sin. $^{3}$^{1} From the point of view of the volition, it either occurs or not. These two aspects are ordered according to  an  order  of  conceptual priority ( natura prius )  within  a  single  instant. The will, insofar as it is considered as a power for opposites, is naturally prior to its exercising this power one way or the other (Vat. VI, 418). The true proposition corresponding to the divided sense of the sentence thus refers to two distinct instants of nature. As C. Normore summarizes: 'the prior is that in which the angel has both the power to love God and the power to hate God, and the posterior is that in which the angel has actualized  the  power  to  love  God.' $^{3}$^{2} In  a  similar  way,  though  God's  will  is absolutely immutable, he wills contingently his objects, so that while he decides to create A he could at the same time decide to create something else. $^{3}$^{3}\n\nnonrepugnancy.  Scotus  sometimes  calls  the  corresponding  kind  of  necessity necessitas inevitabilitatis . See Rep. I A, d. 39-40, q. 1-3, n. 27, ed. Söder, 246.\n\n$^{3}$^{1} Rational powers are thus endowed with many powers for one e fect. The angel does f not have the contradictory power of sinning and not sinning at the same time, but two powers.\n\n$^{3}$^{0} See Ord . I, d. 39, n. 17, Vat. VI, 419-20.\n\n$^{3}$^{2} C.  Normore 'Duns Scotus's Modal Theory,' 135. See also J.  Schmutz,  'Du  péché  de l'ange à la liberté d'indi férence: Les sources angélologiques de l'anthropologie moderne,' f Les Etudes Philosophiques (2002): 169-98 for uses of the same thought experiment during the early modern period.\n\n$^{3}$^{3} Ord . I, d. 39, n. 22, Vat. VI, 427.\n\nAbandoning  the  necessity  of  the  present  has  important  consequences concerning  the  relationship  between  time  and  modality.  Though  the present is ontologically determinate, it is nevertheless contingent, so that logical determination does not entail necessity. $^{3}$^{4} This undercuts the fatalist inference in De interpretatione ,  Chapter 9, which derives the necessity of  future states of a fairs from the present truth of the propositions corf responding  to  them.  Nevertheless,  Scotus  does  not  completely  separate time and modality. This appears in his reply to the objection that what is past is necessary and unavoidable, so that God's predestination entails that someone who is predestined is unable to sin. Scotus answers by fi rst conceding the necessity of past states of a fairs. f $^{3}$^{5} The underlying intuition is the commonsense assumption that there are no backward-looking powers. However, since God exists in an eternal present, none of his acts passes away. Therefore, God's acts are eternally contingent, so that God can bring it  about  that  if  someone  sins  now  it  will  never  have  been  true  that  he was predestined. But this opens up a possible discrepancy between God's present and ours, or in other words between what is possible for God, and what is possible for us. $^{3}$^{6} If I was in Rome yesterday, there is nothing I can do now to prevent this from having happened. In contrast, God's eternal present coexists with our past, so that from God's perspective what is possible  never becomes impossible. This, in turn, entails a tension over the nature of pastness.\n\nIV\n\nThus far,  we  have  examined  the  nature  of  free  will  and  of  contingency, its root in both divine and created will, and how it fi ts within the modal\n\n$^{3}$^{4} Ord . I, d. 39, n. 26, Vat. VI, 432.\n\n$^{3}$^{6} See C. Normore, 'Duns Scotus's Modal Theory.'\n\n$^{3}$^{5} Lectura I, d. 40, q. un., n. 9, Vat. XVII, 512-13: 'Ad primum argumentum quando arguitur quod illud quod transiit in praeteritum est necessarium-concedatur. Et quando arguitur  quod 'istum praedestinari' transiit in praeteritum, dicendum quod hoc falsum est: si enim voluntas nostra semper haberet eandem volitionem in eodem instanti immobili, non esset sua volitio praeterita sed semper in actu. Et sic est de volitione divina, quae semper eadem est: unde sicut dictum est, eadem volitione qua vult aliquem praedestinare, potest velle  eundem damnari pro eodem instanti aeternitatis. Unde quod dicitur in praeterito, quod Deus praedestinavit, ibi, 'praedestinavit' copulat nunc aeternitatis ut coexistit 'nunc' praeterito.'\n\nframework. Now, we are in a position to turn to Scotus's account of God's knowledge. There is a preliminary problem concerning the scope of Scotus's inquiry. Traditionally, it is thought that Scotus answers two questions: (1) How does God know future contingents? And (2) is God's knowledge of future events compatible with their contingency? Following E. Dekker, we may call the fi rst the Source question, and the second the Reconciliation question. $^{3}$^{7} Some recent interpreters deny that Scotus answers the Source question, and claim that he tried only to solve the Reconciliation question. There is some textual support for this view, $^{3}$^{8} and it has important consequences on the interpretation of Scotus's position as we will see. However, it is di ffi cult not to read some passages as (perhaps incomplete) explanations of how God can be said to have knowledge of what is contingent. $^{3}$^{9} And,  as  will  appear  later,  Molina  understood  Scotus  as  providing  an account  of  the  Source  question.  This  is  why  I  present  Scotus's  account along the traditional interpretation.\n\nScotus  develops  his  own  account  of  foreknowledge  as  an  alternative to  Aquinas's.  The  latter  tried  to  explain  the  compatibility  between  the certitude  of  divine  foreknowledge  and  the  contingency  of  its  objects  by claiming that, though future events, in relation to the 'now of time' ( nunc temporis ), are not yet actual and thereby contingent, they are nevertheless present to the now of eternity ( nunc aeternitatis ),  and from this point of view their occurrence is determinate and necessary and can be the object of  a  certain  knowledge. $^{4}$^{0} The  idea  of  temporal  things  coexisting  within God's eternity is the core of the theory. Eternity is agreed to be some kind of nonsuccessive duration. $^{4}$^{1} What is contentious is the notion of eternal presence. According to Scotus's realist interpretation, God, being eternal, is present to all the moments of time, and hence, to all events, past, present, and future. $^{4}$^{2} This presence implies a form of simultaneity. Therefore\n\n$^{3}$^{7} See E. Dekker, 'Does Scotus Need Molina?'\n\n$^{3}$^{9} See Rep . I A, d. 38, q. 1-2, n. 11, ed.

XVII,  500; Ord .  I, d. 39, n. 22, Vat. VI, 427: 'restat videre secundum principale, qualiter cum hoc stat certitudo scientiae' (cf. n. 12, Vat. VI, 413).\n\n$^{4}$^{0} Thomas Aquinas, Summa contra Gentiles ,  I,  c.  66-67 and Summa Theologiae I, q. 14, a. 13, in corp.\n\n$^{4}$^{2} Lectura I, d. 39, n. 23, Vat. XVII, 486.\n\n$^{4}$^{1} Traditionally, Boethius's de fi nition of eternity is given: 'aeternitas est interminabilis vitae tota simul et perfecta possessio' ( Consolatio philosophiae , ed. L. Bieler [Corpus Christianorum Series Latina] 94/1 [Turnhout: 1957], V, pr. 6, l.9-11). See Thomas Aquinas, SCG I, c. 66, n. 7; ST I, q. 10, a. 4, in corp.\n\n336\n\nthings are present in themselves ( in seipsis ) to God, which entails that all moments of time somehow exist tenselessly in the now of eternity, as the points on the circumference of a circle are equidistant to its center, which can be represented as God's eternal now.\n\nWe may now turn to Scotus's positive account. According to him, God's knowledge contains three moments, or instants of nature. The fi rst stage is God's natural knowledge of all necessary propositions. At this stage, every logical possibility is an object of God's knowledge, which depends only on\n\nScotus's objections are based on a dynamical conception of time, according to which the f luxus temporis is an objective feature of existence. $^{4}$^{3} Suppose one starts with the assumption that God coexists with some event E .  This means that God is somehow simultaneous with E occurring at T . Now, if God is present to another event E' ,  occurring at T' future relative to T , then God is simultaneous with E' , and, by the transitivity of simultaneity, E and E' would be simultaneous too, which destroys their temporal order. Furthermore, E' would be real at T , and then it would be impossible for God to create it at T' .  And one could not reply that E '  is  not  yet  real, though  simultaneous  with  God's  eternity,  for  simultaneity  being  a  real relation  requires  that  its  terms  really  exist. $^{4}$^{4} Pace the  parallel  with  the case of immensity, Scotus considers that God's immensity entails that he is present to all existing places, not to possible but nonactual places. Likewise, God's eternity does not entail that nonactual times, like the future, are present to him, only that they will be, when they will be actualized. $^{4}$^{5} Another  objection  is  that  if  God  knew  contingent  events  only  because he perceives them somehow when they are present, then his knowledge would  be  imperfect,  and  could  not  ground  his  providence. $^{4}$^{6} Finally,  if mere coexistence were su ffi cient  to  ground  foreknowledge of the future contingent  states  of  a fairs,  the  angels  would  naturally  foreknow  them, f which is denied by Aquinas himself. $^{4}$^{7}\n\n$^{4}$^{3} See Rep . IA, d. 38, n. 28, ed. Söder, 231: 'tempus sic fl uat quod non habet existentiam post fl uxum. Si nihil  remaneret  nisi  punctus,  ergo  nihil  circumferentiae  coexistit  centro nisi punctus.'\n\n$^{4}$^{5} Is  the  present  the  only  real  time,  as  the  circle  metaphor  suggests  (cf.  Lectura  I, d. 39, n. 85, Vat. XVII, 507; Ord . I, d. 39, n. 35, Vat. VI, 441), or does Scotus grant reality to the past as well? His remarks on the determination and necessity of the past (cf. Ord . I, d. 39, n. 26, Vat. VI, 432) tend to show that past events and states of a fairs are somehow real. See f N.  Lewis,  'Space  and  Time,'  in The  Cambridge  Companion  to  Scotus ,  ed.  Th.  Williams, 84-85.\n\n$^{4}$^{4} Ord . I, d. 39, n. 9, Vat. VI, 409.\n\n$^{4}$^{6} Ord . I, d. 39, n. 10, Vat. VI, 411; Rep . IA, d. 38, q. 1-2, n. 24, ed. Söder, 230.\n\n$^{4}$^{7} Ord.

Consider the terms of the relations  of  repugnance  and  compossibility.  These  are  logically  simples and are sometimes called by Scotus notae . Such notae are related to others according to repugnance or compossibility, independently of any power to bring them about. $^{4}$^{8} However, they are not self-subsistent entities, but are  the  products  of  God's  intellectual  activity,  which  thus  endows  them with an ontological status, as intelligible beings. But the logical and modal properties of these entities are not constituted by God's intellectual activity.  Scotus  summarizes  this  by  claiming  that  the possibilia are  formally such from themselves ( formaliter ex se ), but 'principially' from God ( principiative  ab  eo ). $^{4}$^{9} All  logical,  mathematical,  and  metaphysical  truths,  in general all necessary truths, are known at precisely the instant when God produces, thinks things, and produces them in an esse intelligibile .  Moreover,  since  the  relations  of  compossibility  and  repugnance  are  independent  from  God's  intellectual  activity,  any  modal  truth  is  necessarily  so. This  entails  that  anything  possible  is  necessarily  possible.  According  to Scotus, all combinations of compatible notae are objects of God's knowledge,  which  he  calls  also  ideas. $^{5}$^{0} Scotus  is  less  explicit  on  the  content of  ideas  than  on  their  ontological  status,  but  it  is  likely  that  an  idea  is an  intellectual  representation  of  any  object,  either  of  an  individual  like 'Socrates' or of a common nature like 'man' and that it contains everything  that  can  be  grasped  by  God  through  his  intellect  alone.  An  idea would be something like the deductive closure of all necessary truths concerning a given object. For instance, God's intellect produces the notae of animality and rationality and these, being intrinsically nonrepugnant, can be combined in a single subject, man. And man can be combined with an individual di ferentia to produce a possible individual, say 'Socrates.' The f idea  of  Socrates  contains  all  the  properties  grounding  necessary  truths concerning him: that he is a man, that he is a rational animal, and that it\n\n$^{4}$^{8} Ord . I, d. 36, q. un., n. 60-61, Vat. VI, 296. On what follows, see C. Normore, 'Scotus, Modalities, Instants of Nature and the Contingency of the Present,' in John Duns Scotus. Metaphysics and Ethics , ed. L. Honnefelder, R. Wood, and M. Dreyer (STGM) 53 (Cologne: 1996), 161-74.\n\n$^{5}$^{0} Ord . I, d. 35, n. 42, Vat. VI, 263: 'ipsum obiectum cognitum est idea.' Scotus borrows the traditional Platonic terminology, but gives it a very di ferent meaning. Against Henry f of Ghent, he claims that ideas are not ontologically independent entities, enjoying an esse essentiae ( Ord .  I,  d.  36,  n.  34,  Vat.  VI, 284). And against Aquinas, Scotus claims that ideas are not exemplar forms, guiding God's practical knowledge of his creation. See Rep .  I  A, d. 36, q. 3, passim in T. Noone, 'Scotus on Divine Ideas: Rep. Paris. I-A, d.36,' Medioevo 24 (1998): 359-453.\n\n$^{4}$^{9} See Ord . I, d. 43, n. 18, Vat. VI, 369.\n\n338\n\nis possible that he is sitting at T ,  and so on. However, it does not include the property of sitting at T , because it is a contingent truth.\n\nAt this stage of the process, contingent propositions form pairs of contradictories which are disjunctively necessary, therefore true, but none of which  is  true  nor  false.  Each  member  of  such  disjunctions  is  a  neutral proposition that lacks a truth-value. $^{5}$^{5} This, however, does not amount to a  restriction of the Principle of Bivalence (PB), because this stage corresponds to an instant of nature, and there is no time at which contingent propositions lack truth-values. $^{5}$^{6} At this stage there are possible states of a fairs  and  true  propositions f de  possibili ,  but  there  are  literally  no  contingent  states  of  a fairs  nor  true  contingent  propositions  corresponding f\n\nThis  leads  Scotus  to  reject  theories  that  ground  God's  knowledge  of future  contingents  on  his  ideas. $^{5}$^{1} First,  they  can  ground  only  analytical, thus necessary truths. $^{5}$^{2} Moreover, ideas are intellectual representations, excluding any volitional element. They are therefore purely natural occurrences  in  God's  mind.  Since  God's  will  is  the  only  root  of  contingency, it  follows that ideas necessarily have their content and cannot ground a representation of contingent states of a fairs. f $^{5}$^{3} Conversely, suppose that God's knowledge of future contingents were based on ideas, then he would not be omniscient, for he would know that Socrates could be either sitting or standing up at T ,  not that he is sitting at T .  Finally, there would be no more di ference between God's knowledge of what is actual and of what f is simply possible. The thrust of Scotus's criticism is his claim that being a  purely  intellectual,  prevolitional,  representation  and  being  the  representation  of  something  contingent  are  incompatible  properties.  Since  it is  a  natural  power,  God's  intellect  can  ground  neither  the  truth  nor  the knowledge of anything contingent. $^{5}$^{4}\n\n$^{5}$^{1} It can be attributed to Bonaventure, In Sent .

At  136 f., f he  discusses  a  similar  objection  from  Gregory  of  Rimini, Lectura I,  d.  38,  q.  2,  a.  2,  ed. D. Trapp - V.

I A, d. 38, q. 1-2, n. 37, ed. Söder, 233.\n\nto  them. This alethic (and a fortiori ontological) indetermination entails an epistemic indetermination: in the fi rst  instant  of  nature,  God  has  no determinate knowledge of what is contingent. $^{5}$^{7}\n\nIt may be remarked that Scotus is not very explicit on the combinations of  simple  states  of  a fairs.  Compossibility  is  the  fundamental  relation. f Since it is de fi ned in terms of non repugnantia alone, it is not a transitive relation (i.e. it is possible that A is compossible with B and B compossible with C and yet A is not compossible with C ). Compossibility alone is therefore not rich enough a relation to partition all possible states of a fairs into f maximal collections of states of a fairs,  or  possible  worlds.  At  this  level, f there seem thus to be possible situations, but not what we would call possible worlds. There is however a privileged class of states of a fairs, those f that get actualized through God's choice. This can be described as a complete possible situation and Scotus sometimes uses the phrase ordo rerum to characterize it. Therefore at least the actual world is similar to a possible world. Moreover, Scotus sometimes speaks of various ordines rerum each corresponding to some hypothetical exercise of God's ordained power. $^{5}$^{8} Though this might look a bit speculative, one could interpret that as the tacit  recognition  that  just  as  the  states  of  a fairs  constituting  the  actual f ordo rerum are selected through God's will, the other ordines are de fi ned by which states of a fairs God could decide to co-create. In this respect, it f is not inappropriate to see Scotus's modal framework as an anticipation of modern possible world modal semantics and metaphysics. $^{5}$^{9} Just as God's intellect  constitutes  the  ontological  ground  to  his  knowledge  of  necessary truths, his will is the root of his knowledge of contingent truths. This means that God produces some states of a fairs in a 'willed being' ( f esse volitum ) which only actual states of a fairs enjoy, and that he determines f through  his  will  which  contingent  propositions  are  true,  and  which  are false. He decides to actualize one of the states of a fairs corresponding to f any pair of contradictory neutral propositions. By actualizing such a state\n\n$^{5}$^{7} Rep. I A, d. 38, q. 1-2, n. 37, ed. Söder, 233.\n\n$^{5}$^{9} See D.C. Langston, God's Willing Knowledge and S. Knuuttila, Modalities in Medieval Philosophy .  I  would share C. Normore's verdict: 'although one can fi nd the ingredients in Scotus's picture for talking about possible worlds, the notion would do little or no work within that picture itself' ('Duns Scotus's Modal Theory,' 155). See below, section 12, for additional reservations.\n\n$^{5}$^{8} Talking about the nature of God's ordained power, Scotus claims for instance in Ord I, d. 44, q. un., n. 8, Vat. VI, 366: ' fi eret ordinate secundum alium ordinem, quem ordinem ita posset voluntas divina statuere sicut potest agree.' This alius ordo is clearly a maximal collection of compossible states of a fairs. f\n\nof  a fairs,  God's  will  makes  the  corresponding  proposition  true,  and  its f contradictory false. God's will is thus somehow the truth-maker of every true contingent proposition. $^{6}$^{0} It is an appropriate truth-maker, since it is a rational power: while he wills that some proposition p is true, he could at the same time will that p is  false. Let us summarize through an example: eternal happiness and its negation are both compossible with Peter's essence, and so in a fi rst instant of nature, God knows that it is possible that Peter is happy, and that it is possible that Peter is miserable. Then, in  a  second instant of nature, God decrees that Peter should be granted eternal happiness, thereby making true 'Peter will be happy.' Finally, in a third instant of nature, God knows through his intellect that Peter will be happy. $^{6}$^{1} In the three versions of his commentary on Sentences I, d. 39, Scotus adds a modi fi ed version in order to avoid the charge of introducing discursivity  within  God's  intellect,  which  would  compromise  the  latter's simplicity.  In  the  second  version,  God  does  not  infer  knowledge  of  contingent propositions on the basis of the knowledge of his own decrees. $^{6}$^{2} Rather, while he decrees that p rather  than not-p is  true  (for  contingent p ), his essence represents ipso facto the truth of p and is the whole ratio cognoscendi of any such truth. $^{6}$^{3}\n\nV\n\nThe solution proposed by Scotus to the Source question seems straightforward, but when we turn to the Reconciliation problem, matters become\n\n$^{6}$^{0} The  phrase esse  volitum appears  in Ord .

Suppose that God has decreed that p (e.g. 'Agent S wills A at T '),  and thereby foreknows it. If the agent is free, this seems to entail that he could exercise his power of not willing A at T .  But then, either he would do something contrary to God's knowledge which would threaten  his  infallibility, $^{6}$^{4} or  God's  decree  that p would  not  be  a  su ffi -cient condition for his knowing that p .  William Ockham argued that the theory  leads  to  a  dilemma:  either  God's  decree  is  a  su ffi cient  condition for God's knowledge, but then no one's act is necessitated by it, and it is not possible to act contrary to what one actually does; or one is free and then God's knowledge is not secured by the determination of his will. $^{6}$^{5} The synchronic theory of contingency guarantees that p is  contingent in itself, insofar as it proceeds from an ever-present decree of God. However, this  contingency is just an e fect of God's contingent willing, who, or so f it  seems,  is  the  only  being  endowed  with  actual  free  will.  Thus  Scotus's theory, though it leaves room for some form of contingency, $^{6}$^{6} would rule out the existence of created free will satisfying the conditions set out by Scotus.  This  has  led  some  Scotus  scholars  to  suspect  that  his  theory  is inconsistent. $^{6}$^{7} According to others, the theory is consistent, because Scotus is in e fect a proponent of (theological) determinism. Appearances notf withstanding, Scotus would not develop a libertarian notion of free will, and the notion of a power for contraries must be understood as requiring nothing  more  than  a  mere  ability  (or  even  the  mere  logical  possibility) to  act  in  a  contrary  way. $^{6}$^{8} Finally,  some others embrace a diametrically opposed interpretation and maintain that Scotus is a full-blown libertarian  with  respect  to  human  free  will.  But  then,  one  is  obliged  to  answer Ockham's challenge on Scotus's behalf. $^{6}$^{9}\n\n$^{6}$^{4} See Ord .  I,  d.  39,  n.  24,  Vat.  VI,  429-30; Rep .

Langston has defended such a view in God's willing Knowledge . Langston believes that Scotus's notion of freedom involves two claims: (i) the agent has the ability to perform A and the ability to refrain from A ;  and (ii) the agent wills the performance (or the refraining) in accordance with his nature.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn order to grasp Scotus's solution to this dilemma, one needs to turn to the problem of God's foreknowledge of evil actions or sins. This problem is  extensively discussed in other passages, especially in the commentary on Sent .  II,  d. 37. $^{7}$^{0} Scotus discusses a strongly libertarian and incompatibilist position, which the Vatican editors ascribe to Peter John Olivi. $^{7}$^{1} The core thesis is the a ffi rmation that the will can be free only if it is absolutely undetermined,  in  other  words,  only  if  it  is  a causa  totalis  et  immediate respectu suae volitionis .  The  position  discussed  by  Scotus  holds  thus  the following claim:\n\nIf agent S has it within his power to will A , then there cannot be a causal requisite R of S' willing such that (i) A cannot occur without R's causing and (ii) R is not within S' power.\n\nArmed with this principle, Olivi argues that if God's willing were a condition satisfying (i) it would also satisfy (ii), and therefore exclude S' freely willing.  The  reason  is  that  God's  will  exists  eternally  so  that  our  temporally limited willing could not control it. Scotus concedes that Olivi's position  provides  an  easy  answer  for  excusing  God  from  the  responsibility of  evil. $^{7}$^{2} But  it  cannot  be  reconciled  with  the  exclusive  role  of  God  in predestination, and more generally, with the idea of hierarchy of causes. Moreover,  it  would  undermine  the  infallibility  of  God's  knowledge  of future contingents, if it is based on God's knowledge of his own decrees. This  leads  Scotus  to  provide  an  alternative  account.  In  order  to  achieve that, he uses the device of partial causes cooperating to produce a single e fect. f $^{7}$^{3} There is nothing new to the idea that God's action is necessary to sustain the created world's existence and causal activity within it. What is distinctive of Scotus's position is the way he integrates his account within a  general  theory  of  partial,  cooperating  causes. $^{7}$^{4} In  general,  he  distin-\n\ninterpreters,  see  A.

II, d. 34-37, q. 5, n. 117 and n. 142-43.\n\nguishes three ways distinct causes might be ordained in the production of a single e fect. Accidentally ordained causes are such that a single cause f could independently produce the whole e fect if its power were intensif fi ed,  as  when  two  horses  are  needed  to  pull  a  cart,  one  of  them  could nevertheless su ffi ce, provided he were strong enough. The next two cases concern essentially ordered causes. Sometimes, the causal activity of the subordinated cause is wholly consequent upon the fi rst  cause's  activity. This  happens  when,  for  instance,  the  hand  moves  a  sta f:  the  sta f  has f f no motion of its own, but only as it is acted upon by the hand. $^{7}$^{5} Finally, the  two  causes  sometimes  play  an  essentially  distinct  and  complementary causal role, though one is ontologically superior to the other. As an example, Scotus mentions the generation of a child, which requires the actions of both the father and the mother as its immediate causes, though the male is considered as intrinsically superior to the female.\n\nIn  the  present  case,  God  and  the  created  will  can  be  considered  as two  partial  cooperating  causes  of  the  third  kind.  Contrary  to  Aquinas's account, God's will does not act directly on the created will, but cooperates with the latter in order to produce a single volition. From this point of view, the actualization of a causal power does not need the in fl uence of the fi rst cause, except for its sustaining in existence. This remains vague, however, for God's primacy could still imply some way of determining the created  will's  causation.  But  God  would  be  guilty  of  sin  if  his  causation were the root of the de fi ciency constitutive of the sinful action. With the help of this idea, Scotus develops his own solution to the problem of God's concurrence to sin. It is worth quoting at length:\n\nThus, if the created will and the divine will concur to the created will's willing, there can be a defect in the willing itself due to the defect of one of the two causes. And from this 000, because this cause could give rectitude to its act, and is bound to give, but nevertheless does not, while the other cause, though it is not bound to give it, nevertheless 'so far as it is in itself ' ( quantum est ex se ),  would give it, if the created will were to cooperate. Indeed,\n\ncognition and then again. In Lectura II,  d.  25,  n.  71-73,  Vat.  XVII,  253-54, Scotus pictures the  intellect  and  will  in  the  production  of  a  volition  as  two  partial,  cooperating  causes. See above n. 000.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\neverything God gave antecedently, He would give consequently (so far as it is in Himself), unless there should be an impediment. By giving to the free will,  He  gave  antecedently  the  right  works  ( opera recta )  which  are  within the  will's  power.  And  thus,  as  for  His  part,  He  gave  rectitude  to  every  act of will-and He would give consequently to the will, if the will itself were to cause rightly any elicited act as for its part ( ex parte sui ). . . . The superior cause quantum est ex se would cause, if the inferior would cause according to its own causality ( Ord . II, d. 34-37, q. 5, n. 143-44, Vat. VIII, 428-29).\n\nAccording  to  this  passage,  neither  evil  acts  would  occur  without  a  created  will's  causality,  nor  would  righteous  action  without  God's  concurrence. To understand the whole process, one needs to start from the will's power for opposites. (i) If S actualizes her power for A , and A is right, God would concur with S by producing the needed rectitude in A . But (ii) if S actualizes her power for notA ,  then God would not concur with S .  As  a consequence, S' action would not be right nor meritorious, and S would sin,  because he could have chosen to actualize A instead.  The combination  of  (i)  and  (ii)  entails  a  kind  of  counterfactual  dependency  of  God's will (which is presupposed by his concurrence and foreknowledge) upon the created will's choice. In case (i), God wills that A , whereas in case (ii), God is said only to permit A .  This  dependency  is  asymmetrical,  for  it  is not required in the case of the meritorious actions of the predestined, but only to explain how one can excuse God from any responsibility for sin. One might wonder if the discussion of this issue does not rest on a di ferf ent account of foreknowledge from the one explicitly developed earlier. Indeed, according to Scotus:\n\n- (1) f I S is free and wills A , then (i) God eternally foreknows that S wills A and (ii) if S had not willed A , God would have foreknown that S does not will A .\n\nIf  one  maintains that foreknowledge is based on a divine decision, then (ii) amounts to:\n\n- (1') ii')  If ( S had not willed A ,  then God would have decreed that S does not will A .\n\nBut then there seems to be a covariance of God's decrees with the creatures'.  If  one  reminds  that  God's  decrees,  being  eternal,  never  fade  into past, and remain forever contingent, one might conclude that the power not to will A remains within S' power even if it is foreknown that S shall\n\nwill A . Scotus's position as it is exposed in this passage is consonant with a  form  of  libertarianism,  though  not  of  the  extreme  incompatibilism defended  by  Olivi.  He  would  modify  the  latter's  condition  for  freedom, by revising the power condition: some requisite might be such that they are  neither  within  the  will's  power  nor  independently  given.  This  new account  has  the  advantage  of  rendering  God's  foreknowledge  and  the will's  freedom  compatible,  and  enabling  to  answer  Ockham's  challenge. The trouble is that, though not inconsistent with the 'o ffi cial'  view,  this account departs from the latter's greater intelligibility as a theory of how God knows future contingents. For such an infallible covariance without any dependence of God's will upon knowledge of the creature's decisions runs the risk of looking either as something like a cosmic coincidence or a pure mystery of faith. $^{7}$^{6}\n\n## VII\n\nWe are now in a position to grasp Molina's relation to Scotus's thought. To begin with, I shall examine Molina's conception of free will and divine concurrence, where Scotus's in fl uence is most explicit. Then I will examine  the  criticisms  raised  by  the  Jesuit  against  the  Subtle  Doctor  against the latter's account of foreknowledge. Finally, after a brief examination of Molina's theory of foreknowledge, I will try to assess, beyond the apparent points of agreement and criticisms, the deep-level relations between these two thinkers.\n\nMolina's  de fi nition  of  free  will  ( liberum  arbitrium )  clearly  has  Scotist roots. Both consider the will as both the locus and the source of freedom, against the preeminence of the intellect, which characterizes the Thomistic\n\n$^{7}$^{6} Whatever its obscurities, many theologians of the Renaissance, under the in fl uence of Scotus, articulated such a theory of concomitant decrees. Among others, the Franciscans Antonio de Cordoba and Andrés de Vega proposed such views. Cf. Antonio de Cordoba, Quaestionarium theologicum , I, q. 55, dub. 11-12, 000; Andrés de Vega, Tridentini decreti de Iusti fi catione expositio et defensio ,  000 (Alcala: 1564), 000; Andrés de Vega in Anfray 2004, 202, n. 57. According to the latter, if the will is free, then if S wills A , then God has decreed that S would  will A ,  but S has  the  power  not  to  will A ,  and  if  he  actualized  this  power, then God would have eternally decreed that S would not have willed A . Among the Jesuits, Gabriel Vázquez seems to have developed an answer to the foreknowledge dilemma based on such concomitant decrees (000).\n\n346\n\n## jean pascal anfray -\n\ntradition. $^{7}$^{7} Will is a free cause according to Molina. $^{7}$^{8} It enjoys a freedom from necessity which is de fi ned in the following way:\n\nThat  agent  is  free,  which,  when  all  requisites  for  acting  are  present,  can act  and  not  act,  or  act  in  such  a  way  that  it  can  equally  act  in  a  contrary way.  And  it  is  because  of  such  a  freedom  that  the  faculty  through  which such an agent can act this way is said to be free. . . . And free will ( liberum arbitrium ) . . . is  nothing  else  but  the  will,  which  is  formally  free  according to our de fi nition, when it is preceded by a judgment of reason ( Concordia , disp. 2, n. 3, ed. Antwerpen, 8a).\n\nAlthough Molina does not give up the requirement of rationality in order that a being be free, his de fi nition shows that the essential property of a free agent is that her actions do not occur deterministically. That is to say, if agent S is  free, then there is no set of requisites R prior to S' s choosing some  course  of  action A such  that R entails  that S wills  that A .  This  is Molina's way of understanding freedom as a potestas ad opposita , a power for  opposites. $^{7}$^{9} Molina's  insistence  on  the  fact  that  such  a  power  is  to be understood in sensu composito shows that free will does not involve a simple ability fl owing from the nature of the agent, but also the presence of a real opportunity. For instance, someone who is constantly chained to a  seat  during an interval of time T ,  thereby loses her power to stand up and is therefore not free during T . $^{8}$^{0} On the contrary, if she desires to sit\n\n$^{7}$^{7} Concordia ,  disp.  2,  n.  9.  I  will  quote  from A.J. Freddoso's translation when possible. In other cases, I will refer to the second edition of the work in the Antwerpen edition of 1595.\n\n$^{7}$^{9} Concordia , disp. 2, n. 3; cf. disp. 53, memb. 2, n. 17.\n\n$^{7}$^{8} Concordia , disp. 24, n. 8.\n\n$^{8}$^{0} D. Langston acknowledges this, and considers that Molina departs from Scotus on this  score  (see God's willing  Knowledge ,  67).  But  one  must  be  cautious  here,  for  if  some situation H is  such  that  one  would  certainly  choose  some  de fi nite  course  of  action,  one does not lose one's freedom, if some distinct agent actualizes and maintains situation H . If I were presented a box of chocolate, I would take one, but I do not lose my free will just because I am repeatedly o fered some, and do not decline any. Molinist free will entails f the power to will the opposite of what one actually wills in certain circumstances, not the power to control the circumstances where one fi nds himself into.  The theory of middle knowledge ( infra ) rests on this idea: an agent, having both the ability and the opportunity to will the opposite in a situation H , is such that if placed in H , he would (freely) do A and some agent, say God, knows this and has the power to ensure that S is placed in H . Moreover, one could exploit this idea to reinterpret some passages where Scotus claims that the blessed in heaven are free to love God, though he prevents them from sinning ( Ord . IV, d. 49, q. 6, n. 11, Wadding X, 455). According to Langston the situation is analogous to the case where someone is chained to a seat and, while having an ability to stand up, is deprived of the opportunity to do so ( God's willing Knowledge , 40-41, 50, and 122-23). Scotus's own example of the eye retaining the power to see the sky, in spite of the presence of a perpetually intervening obstacle, apparently comforts Langston's interpretation. But it is possible\n\nand sees that there is nothing wrong to this, then she is free only if these psychological (and other causal) requirements do not entail that she will sit, but leave it open for her to stand up. This feature explains why Molinist  freedom is also called freedom of indi ference, which means that the f motives presented by the intellect do not determine the will to its choice. $^{8}$^{1} Molina argues as Scotus did, that the existence of free will is a matter of psychological experience and cannot be rationally denied. $^{8}$^{2}\n\nFinally,  Molina  subscribes  to  Scotus's  idea  of  a  non-evident  power  of the will to simultaneously will A and not will A . This is the central thrust of  disputation  24  of  the Concordia , where  Molina  overturns  Ockham's arguments against the idea of a synchronic power for opposites. Ockham had objected to Scotus's non-evident power for opposites, that it entails a denial of the law of contradiction and refused to countenance instants of nature. According to Ockham, one is free to will either of two contradictory courses of action before the time T when the volition is elicited. But at T , if one wills A , this makes refraining from A impossible. In other words, dual possibility is essentially forward-looking. $^{8}$^{3} According to Molina, this entails  that  one  is  free  just  before  one  acts,  but  not  at  the  time  when an  act  is  elicited.  Since  he  assumes  that  one  is  responsible  for  an  act A occurring at T ,  only  if  one  is  free  at T ,  he  infers  that  Ockham's denial of the Scotist simultaneous power for opposites leads to a denial of responsibility. Moreover, Molina rehearses Scotus's case of the angel existing for a  single  instant  of  time,  or  of  the  actual  angels  at  the  moment  of  their creation. $^{8}$^{4} According  to  Molina,  such  an  angel  is  free  at  this  moment, otherwise he could not be responsible for what he does. He avoids falling into contradiction by using the Scotist device of the distinction of many instantia naturae within a single temporal instant. $^{8}$^{5} While he wills A at T , such an angel must also have at T the power to refrain from A . This power\n\nto understand Scotus di ferently (by extrapolating a bit from Scotus's f fi nal answer ibid. n. 15, Wadding X, 457), if one considers it as a situation where God constantly maintains the situation under which he knows that the blessed will freely avoid sinning. The distinction here is very like the one proposed by Freddoso, 26-28.\n\n$^{8}$^{2} Concordia , disp. 23, memb. 1, Antwerpen, 89b-90a.\n\n$^{8}$^{1} See Concordia , disp. 2, n. 6, Antwerpen, 8b and n. 9, Antwerpen, 9a.\n\n$^{8}$^{3} Ockham, Ordinatio , I, d. 38, q. un., OTh IV, 581.\n\n$^{8}$^{5} Concordia disp. 24, n. 8. Such instants are o ffi cially distinct by a distinction of reason, for Molina clearly says elsewhere that it is: 'priority in our way of conceiving it, but with a basis in reality' Concordia , disp. 53, pt. 1, n. 20, trans. Freddoso, 211. However, when he uses the device of instants of nature in the case of volition, he seems to abandon this view.\n\n$^{8}$^{4} Concordia , disp. 24, n. 6; see Schmutz, 'Du péché de l'ange à la liberté d'indi férence,' f for a much more detailed historical analysis of this point.\n\n## 348\n\nis  related  to  an  earlier  instant  of  nature N1 ,  while  the  elicited  volition  is related to a later part of T, N2.\n\nHowever,  the  two  thinkers'  positions  are  only  super fi cially  identical on  this  score.  The  latter,  considering  the  temporal  instant  as  a  whole, maintains that the present is contingent and sees the order of instants of nature as a logical order that does not constitute a parallel quasi-temporal order. On the other hand, according to Molina, the order of natural priority seems to be a discontinuous and irreversible order. He grants that the will is free at N1 to will A and not to will A .  But once its choice, say A ,  is considered as elicited from the point of view of N2 ,  the  power to refrain from A is  destroyed,  and  it  becomes  necessary  that S wills A . $^{8}$^{6} It  could thus be seen as a more fundamental quasi-time order. Therefore, Molina is better seen as downplaying the Aristotelian thesis of the necessity of the present, rather than rejecting it outright, as Scotus does.\n\n## VIII\n\nThe idea of God's general concurrence with created secondary causes is another aspect of Scotus's in fl uence on Molina's thought. $^{8}$^{7} Scotus's conception is an alternative to that of Thomas Aquinas, according to whom creatures act as secondary causes only by participation to God's causation. On the contrary, as we have seen earlier, Scotus conceives their respective contribution on the model of concurring partial causes producing a total e fect. The central tenet of this new paradigm is that God does not act f on the  secondary cause to produce the e fect, but God cooperates f with the created  cause  in  order  to  produce  a  single,  uni fi ed  e fect.  Molina  sides f with Scotus against the Thomistic account. He objects to the latter that it is based on the mistaken idea that creatures' causal powers are essentially incomplete and thus need a kind of motio from their fi rst cause. However, this  would  ruin  the  very  possibility  of  distinguishing  a  causal  power,  be it  natural  or  free,  from  a  mere  requisite.  What  distinguishes  the  former is  that  they  are  complete.  Therefore,  God  is  a  partial,  concurring  cause, along with the created cause. He is absolutely necessary in the sense that\n\n$^{8}$^{6} Concordia disp. 24, n. 5, 9, and 11.\n\n$^{8}$^{7} Concordia disp.  25-28 and the 1572 Quaestio de concursu generali in Geschichte des Molinismus. Bd. I. Neue Molinaschriften , ed. F. Stegmüller (Munster: 1935). More on this in J. Schmutz, 'La doctrine médiévale des causes et la théologie de la nature pure (XIII -XVI e e siècles),' Revue  thomiste 1-2  (2001):  217-64.  In  the Concordia disp.  35,  Antwerpen,  1595, 146b, Molina explicitly refers to Scotus, Ordinatio IV, d. 1, q. 1 000.\n\nno e fect could occur without his causal contribution. However, he does f not determine by himself the nature of the e fect. Rather, God's causation f is  more  like  a  general  power,  which  is  determined  when  it  is  conjoined with a secondary cause's causation. $^{8}$^{8} This is the reason why God's concurrence is characterized as 'indi ferent.' f $^{8}$^{9} Thus not only does Molina give up  the  Thomistic  model  of  the  structure  of  action,  he  also  presents  an altogether di ferent account of its modality. This is particularly important f in the case of created free causes: given God's concurrence with agent S , it  is  both  possible  for S to  will A and  to  refrain  from  willing A .  In  other words, Molina includes God's concurrence among the requisites relative to which the will is indi ferent. f\n\nWhat  is  remarkable  is  that,  while  the  theory  has  clear  antecedents within Scotus, Molina uses it in order to argue against another central Scotist  thesis,  namely that God's will is the root of contingency. He devotes the whole of disputation 35 and part of disputation 47 to refute this last claim. He rehearses Scotus's threefold argumentation, from the transitivity of causal necessity; from the primacy of the fi rst cause with respect to the  created  e fect;  and  from  on  the  causal  su f ffi ciency  of  the fi rst  cause. Molina  claims  that  all  these  arguments  are  unconvincing.  The  last  two entail that God is the only contingent cause, and therefore lead to theological  determinism. The fi rst  argument is incompatible with the theory of concursus  indi ferens f ,  which  has  two  consequences.  First,  under  the impossible assumption that God were acting as a necessary (i.e. natural) agent, there would nevertheless remain contingency within the world. $^{9}$^{0} The reason is simple according to Molina: since the e fect cannot occur f if  one  of  its  partial  causes  does  not  produce  part  of  its  work,  then,  even if  one  cause  acts  necessarily,  the  e fect  would  not  occur if  the  other  did f not  act.  The  theory  of  general  concurrence  neutralizes  so  to  speak  the modality of God's action. Conversely, if God were acting as a free agent, but there were no other, created free agents, then, under the supposition\n\n$^{8}$^{8} See A.J. Freddoso 'Introduction,' in Luis de Molina, On Divine Foreknowledge: Part IV of the Concordia (Ithaca: 1988), 17.\n\n$^{9}$^{0} Concordia , disp. 35, Antwerpen, 1595, 147a: 'esto necesario moveatur, non tamen necessario movere, quando motus quem recipit, neque est tota, neque su ffi ciens causa eius motus, qui ab ipsa emanare debet, sed adhuc ad eum necessaria est, tanquam pars causae libera  cooperation  et  in fl uxus causae ita  motae.  quare  esto  per  impossibile  Deus  necessitate  naturae  in fl ueret  eadem auxilia  gratiae,  quae  reipsa  confert,  maneret  nihilominus libertas in voluntate nostra.'\n\n$^{8}$^{9} Molina, Quaestio de concursu generali , ed. Stegmüller, 199: 'concursus Dei universalis nihil aliud est, quam in fl uxus Dei immediatus in omnes e fectus.' f\n\nthat  God  does  not  act  miraculously,  all  e fects  that  do  not  immediately f depend on God's causal activity (i.e. events like the creation of the world, the  Incarnation,  etc.) $^{9}$^{1} would  happen with a fatal necessity, because all secondary free causes would have been removed. $^{9}$^{2} This kind of necessity is de fi ned by Molina as a causal modality, one that results when the occurring of one event is deterministically entailed by the existence of a chain of earlier events. $^{9}$^{3} Thus according to Molina, causal modalities, contrary to logical modalities, are not absolute nor are they relative to God's causal contribution, but they are relative to the order or secondary causes: E is naturally contingent if E is the e fect of a contingent, secondary cause (i.e. f a free cause). $^{9}$^{4} Therefore, God cannot be the root of contingency within the world, though it may be conceded that he is its remote source insofar as he freely decided to create the world. The theory of general concurrence leads Molina to a position that is super fi cially similar to the position criticized by Scotus, namely that there can be contingency within things even if  the fi rst  cause is necessary. The similarity is super fi cial,  because those criticized by Scotus were mostly determinists, or at least they considered that contingency was a kind of imperfection, deriving from the imperfection of secondary causes. As we have seen, Scotus treats contingency as a mode of being, on a par with necessity, and Molina shares the same point of view. $^{9}$^{5} What separates the two thinkers is their understanding of the role of divine will. For Scotus, it is the ultimate root of any contingency, while  Molina  grants  that  there  are  as  many  quasi-independent  roots  of contingency as there are free causes. He is led to this position by splitting two closely connected Scotist theses, namely, that God's will is the root of contingency, and that God and creature act as essentially ordered cocauses to produce a single e fect. While he develops the latter as one of the f cornerstones of his thought, he thinks that the fi rst is clearly incompatible with it. He is thus led to claim that Scotus is essentially incoherent.\n\n$^{9}$^{1} Concordia , disp. 47, n. 4, see Freddoso 'Introduction,' 20-21.\n\n$^{9}$^{3} Concordia , disp. 47, n. 2; notice that, as remarked by Freddoso at note 19 on p. 94 of his translation, the causal necessity of the occurring of any event presupposes as a condition  that  God  does  not  miraculously suspend his general concurrence; see also disp. 47, n. 12.\n\n$^{9}$^{2} Concordia , disp. 47, n. 9.\n\n$^{9}$^{4} Concordia , disp. 47, n. 10.\n\n$^{9}$^{5} Scotus, Ord . I, d. 39, n.35, Vat. VI, 444: 'contingentia est modus positivus entis (sicut necessitas  est  alius  modus) . . . immo  contingentia  per  prius  est  a  causa  prima  quam secunda.' Cf. Ibid., n. 13, Vat. VI, 414-15.\n\nThe treatment of Aquinas's theory of God's foreknowledge of future contingents as based on their presence to God in eternity is indeed another instance of Molina's complex relationship to Scotus. On the one hand, he defends the coherence of the idea of successive events coexisting in eternity and so he seems to counter Scotus's own arguments against Aquinas, which are rehearsed at the beginning of disputation 48. Signi fi cantly, he accuses Scotus of overlooking the fact that the present tense locution ' E coexists  with  Eternity'  may  connote  either  the  now  of  time  or  the  now of  eternity. $^{9}$^{6} Thus  when  Scotus  claims  that  coexistence  cannot  relate events occurring at successive moments of time T and T' ,  he  thinks that ' E coexists at T with E *'  expresses  Aquinas's  thesis.  But  this  sentence  is plainly false, and ' E coexist in eternity with E *' is the correct expression of  Aquinas's  thesis.  Thus  it  might  seem  that  Molina  opposes  Scotus  on this score.\n\nAnother argument is directly inherited from Scotus: if the presence of things  in  divine  eternity  were  su ffi cient  to  ground  foreknowledge,  then the angels too should be conceded foreknowledge. Molina considers the traditional answer given by the Thomists, namely that, though the aevum is  an  indivisible  duration  measuring  the  existence  of  the  angelic  substances,  their  operations,  in  particular,  the  acts  of  cognition,  are  not  so indivisible,  but  rather  successive.  But  as  a  rejoinder,  Molina  claims  that it  is  possible  that  God conserves a single act of angelic cognition, which would be indivisible and would embrace all events.\n\nHowever, Molina is much closer to the Subtle Doctor's conception of time  and  eternity  than  it  might  seem.  First  of  all,  he  rejects  Aquinas's theory as a su ffi cient explanation of God's foreknowledge. His objections re fl ect the same conceptions as those underpinning Scotus's own objections. A fi rst argument establishes that the presence of things in eternity cannot  account  for  God's  knowledge  before  his  decision  to  create  the world, for either such knowledge is based on God's knowledge of his own intentions, or things would exist in eternity independently of God's decisions which would preclude the exercise of any providence. $^{9}$^{7}\n\nNonetheless,  the  most  interesting  argument  starts  from  the  idea  that future  events  are  still  contingent,  and  so  are  really  able  not  to  occur.\n\n$^{9}$^{6} Concordia , disp. 48, n. 8-9.\n\n$^{9}$^{7} Concordia , disp. 49, n. 15; De scientia Dei , ed. Stegmüller, 227-28.\n\n352\n\nSuppose  that  some  such  event  does  not  occur,  this  implies  that  it  is able  not  to  exist  in  eternity.  It  acquires  a  de fi nite  existence  only  from the  moment  of  its  occurrence.  But  then  it  would  be  wrong  to  say  that God has had an infallible knowledge of this event at any time before this moment. Using the parallel with God's immensity, Molina claims that just as God's immensity does not coexist with nonexistent places, neither does his  eternity  coexist  with  not  yet  existing  moments.  In  Molina's  technical  vocabulary,  adequate eternity corresponds to the whole of time, but this correspondence is not completed until the whole of time has elapsed. When eternity  is  considered  as  corresponding  to  a  stretch  of  time,  it  is taken inadequately and as such, it does not coexist with what follows. $^{9}$^{8} To  illustrate  this,  he  uses  Scotus's  example  of  a  circle  in  the  process  of being drawn. The center corresponds only to the points of the circumference  that  have  been  actually  traced,  but  not  the  ones  that  are  not  yet drawn. This entails a dynamical conception of time, and a notion of eternity  closer  everlastingness  than  to  strict  atemporal  duration. $^{9}$^{9} On  the whole, it appears that Molina's and Scotus's views on the nature of time and eternity di fer only verbally. f\n\nX\n\nThe debate actually bears on a di ferent issue, namely the relation between f time and modality. As was shown above, Scotus does not subscribe to the Aristotelian  notion  of  the  necessity  of  the  present.  Nevertheless,  he  still holds that there is no power over the past. This leads him to a position on foreknowledge that bears striking similarities with the account known as Ockhamism in the foreknowledge debate. Very brie fl y,  according to this view, the fact that God foreknows that S will do A is  compatible with S 's power not to do A . If S actualizes this power and refrains from doing A at T , then he brings it about that God will have foreknown from all eternity that S does  not  do A at T .  On  the  traditional  Ockhamist  account,  God's foreknowledge is indeed a fected with pastness, but escapes its accidental f necessity by not being a fact really about the past (what recent commentators have labeled a 'hard fact'), since its content depends on what is yet\n\n$^{9}$^{8} De  scientia  Dei ,  ed.  Stegmüller,  228-29  especially  'nondum  adsit  tempus  futurum quod illi correspondeat.'\n\n$^{9}$^{9} See  ibid.  Craig  ( The  Problem  of  Divine  Foreknowledge , 172)  holds  to  the  same conclusion.\n\nfuture  and  thus  contingent. $^{1}$^{0}$^{0} The  Ockhamist  thus  holds  the  following claim:\n\n- (2) God has always known that S will do A at T and, until T ( T excluded), S can bring it about that God will always have known that S will not do A . $^{1}$^{0}$^{1}\n\nIf this thesis is combined with an account of knowledge based on divine decrees  and  the  thesis  of  the  necessity  of  the  present,  the  former  claim becomes equivalent to this:\n\n- (2') God decrees that S will do A at T , and, until T  T ( included), S can bring it about that God will always have decreed that S will not do A .\n\nThis latter claim corresponds exactly to Molina's exposition of the theory of concomitant decrees:\n\nfor they maintain that if, for instance, Peter, who let us assume, is going to sin at some moment of time, did not sin at that time (which he is capable of because of his freedom) then God would bring it about that He had never known that Peter was going to sin, but that instead He had always known from eternity that Peter was not going to sin ( Concordia , disp. 51, n. 1).\n\nMolina  objects  to  this  theory  on  the  ground  that  it  compromises  God's providence  and  predestination  and  entails  the  impossibility  of  genuine prophecies. $^{1}$^{0}$^{2} But  his  main  charge  is  that  any  version  of  the  theory  of concomitant  decrees  leads  to  a  denial  of  the  necessity  of  the  past,  and forces one to acknowledge some power over the past in God. $^{1}$^{0}$^{3} The latter\n\n$^{1}$^{0}$^{0} Ockham, Ord . I,  d.  38,  q.  un.,  OT  IV,  588:  'quando  talis  propositio  de  praesenti aequivalet  propositioni  de  futuro  vel  dependet  a  veritate  alicuius  futuri,  non  oportet quod propositioni verae de praesenti correspondeat necessaria de praeterito. Et ita est in prop  osito.'\n\n$^{1}$^{0}$^{2} Concordia , disp. 51, n. 19-20.\n\n$^{1}$^{0}$^{1} Ibid., OT IV, 586. Molina expresses the same view in De scientia Dei , ed. Stegmüller, 242: 'si ego pro mea libertate fecero hoc, Deus faciet se numquam scivisse nisi hoc, et si fecero oppositum, ut de facto possum, Deus faciet se numquam scivisse nisi oppositum.' Molina attributes the view to most scholastics and to many important Tridentine theologians, especially to Antonio de Cordoba and Andrés de Vega (see above, n. 000).\n\n$^{1}$^{0}$^{3} The inference from the (restricted) contingency of God's foreknowledge to a generalized  power  over  the  past  was  highlighted  in  the  14th  century  by  thinkers  like  Peter of  Ailly  and  earlier  by  Thomas  Bradwardine;  see  R.M.  Gaskin,  'Peter  of  Ailly  and  Other Fourteenth  Century  Thinkers  on  Divine  Power  and  the  Necessity  of  the  Past,' Archiv für die Geschichte der Philosophie 79 (1997): 273-91.\n\nis strictly impossible and we see that Molina grants a strong necessity to past states of a fairs. Its medieval label is necessity f per accidens :  once an event has occurred, it becomes contradictory to assume that it has not. $^{1}$^{0}$^{4} According to Molina, any theory along the lines of 2 or 2' entails the contingency of what is past. Suppose for instance that God decrees today that the world never existed: this would have the consequence that some past events did not occur, which is absurd. $^{1}$^{0}$^{5} This criticism of Ockhamism can be extended to the Scotist, eternalist, version of the theory of concomitant decrees. Even if one grants that God's present volitions never fade into the past,  and  therefore  remain  contingent,  they  nonetheless  have  real,  temporally  past  e fects. f $^{1}$^{0}$^{6} As  a  consequence,  while  on  the  one  hand  divine decrees  are  contingent  if  they  are  related  to  eternity  taken  as  a  whole, on the other hand they are accidentally necessary if they are referred to some portion of time. Once God's decision to create the world is actual, it becomes necessary at all later times that God has decided to create the world. $^{1}$^{0}$^{7} What emerges from this is that Molina is close to the Aristotelian picture of the relations of time and modality and distances himself from the consequences of the Scotist conception.\n\nThis becomes a highly disputed issue when one turns to the Molinist treatment  of  the  logical  problem  of  future  contingents.  Interpreters  are opposed on the question of whether Molina endorses or denies the Principle of Bivalence (PB) in the case of future contingent propositions. The fatalist  inference  discussed  by  Aristotle  in De  interpretatione ,  Chapter  9 (18a34-b25) starts from the premise that PB applies to all future contingent  propositions,  and  concludes  to  the  necessity  of  what  will  happen. One way of interpreting the argument is to see it as resting on the idea that if  some proposition is true, then there is a fact that corresponds to it, and facts are such that they are unpreventable. In the case of the past, we think  that  is  stocked  with  truths  and  this  is  the  reason  we  come  to believe that it is unpreventable or necessary. On the traditional interpretation, Aristotle would not deny the principle on which the fatalist inference  is  based,  but  instead  restrict  the  scope  of  PB.  The  fatalist  and  the Aristotelian share the idea that there is a strict match between truth (or\n\n$^{1}$^{0}$^{4} Concordia , disp. 51, n. 12 and Commentaria in primam D. Thomae partem , q. 25, a. 4, 354a-355b. See Craig, The Problem of Divine Foreknowledge , 186-87.\n\n$^{1}$^{0}$^{6} Molina's criticism anticipates C. Normore's remark that 'if what is genuinely past is what is past for us, this raises the very delicate issue of wether what is in our past is really necessary or not' ('Duns Scotus's Modal Theory,' 136).\n\n$^{1}$^{0}$^{5} Concordia , disp. 51, n. 14.\n\n$^{1}$^{0}$^{7} Concordia , disp. 51, n. 25; disp. 48, n. 21; De scientia Dei , ed. Stegmüller, 244-45.\n\nontological determinateness) and necessity. And Molina seems to accept the  same  conclusion. $^{1}$^{0}$^{8} But  Scotus's  conception  of  synchronic  contingency and God's will as a truth-maker for contingent propositions, at least as far as propositions on the present are considered, entails a possible gap between the two. $^{1}$^{0}$^{9} Conversely, Molina's criticisms of the theory of concomitant decrees seem to rest on a fundamentally Aristotelian intuition.\n\nWe have seen above that Molina ascribes deterministic consequences to Scotus's theory of the source of contingency. He comes to same conclusion as far as the latter's account of divine foreknowledge is considered. Scotus's position is summarized in the following way:\n\nhe claims that it is solely in the determination of His will that God knows which part of each contradiction is going to turn out to be contingently true in the future, and thus that it is solely in the free determination of His will that  He  knows  future  contingents  with  certainty  ( Concordia disp.  50,  n.  7, trans. Freddoso, 132).\n\nSuch a theory is  incompatible  with  libertarian  free  will. $^{1}$^{1}$^{0} Suppose  that S is  free  to  will A .  Then  it  must  be  able  to  refrain  from  willing A .  God decides to make ' S wills A ' true by bringing about the corresponding state of  a fairs.  But  this  seems  to  entail  that  either f S is  no  longer  able  not  to will A ,  or God's will would not su ffi ce to ground an infallible knowledge.\n\n$^{1}$^{0}$^{8} Concordia , disp. 52, n. 6, n. 15 and n. 37; Quaestio de futuris contingentibus, ed. Stegmüller, 9: 'si enuntiationes de futuro essent determinate verae, omnia evenirent necessario non solum necessitate consequentiae sed etiam consequentis.' In this passage, Molina does not reconstruct Aristotle's position but seems to give his responsio propria. Matters are complicated by the exact interpretation of the term 'determinate.' According to Craig ( The Problem of Divine Foreknowledge ) and Freddoso ('Introduction'), it means 'necessarily' and on their reading Molina does not restrict PB, but just tries to detect a fallacy in the fatalist  inference.  However,  it  is  more  likely  that  Molina  understands  'determinately'  as expressing the distribution of truth-values within a disjunction of contradictory sentences; see R.M. Gaskin, 'Molina on Divine Foreknowledge and the Principle of Bivalence,' Journal of the History of Philosophy 32 (1994): 551-71. A given sentence is determinately true if it is true and its contradictory is false. And it is indeterminately true i f it is indeterminately f false.  Such  a  reading  of  the  adverb  'determinate'  was  not  uncommon,  for  someone  like Peter Aureol in the 14th century, who explicitly denies that PB applies to future contingent propositions, simply equates determinate verum and verum . Cf. Scriptum super sententias I dist. 38, art. 3, ed. Schabel, Cahiers de l'institut du Moyen Âge Grec et Latin 65 (1995): 126.\n\n$^{1}$^{1}$^{0} De Scientia Dei , ed. Stegmüller, 238; Concordia , disp. 50, n. 7, n. 14.\n\n$^{1}$^{0}$^{9} For Scotus's hesitant claims about the determinacy of the future, see Lectura I, d. 39, n. 69, Vat. XVII, 502-03: 'sed in futuris non est determinatio talis: licet Deus determinate sciat a fore pro aliquo instanti, pro illo tamen potest scire a non fore'; Ord .  I,  d. 39, n. 26, Vat. VI, 432: 'talis autem non est determinatio ex parte futuri, quia licet alicui intellectui sit una pars vera determinate . . . non tamen ita quin in potestate causae est pro illo instanti ponere oppositum.'\n\nNow,  Molina  makes  up  a  possible,  compatibilist  answer  a  Scotist  could give: although 'God wills that S wills A and S does not will A '  expresses an impossible proposition ( in sensu composito ), yet it is possible in sensu diviso that S does not will A .  Molina is reluctant to countenance the pertinence of the distinction in such a case, because there are two types of conditional necessity of the form 'necessarily (if P ,  then Q ).'  If  the  antecedent P is such that if someone S has the power to bring it about that Q is not true, then S has the power to bring it about that P is not true either, we can consistently maintain both 'it is impossible that P and notQ ' and ' S has the power to make notQ true.' If, however, the truth of the antecedent is beyond the scope of S ,  then it should be denied that S has the power to make notQ true. $^{1}$^{1}$^{1}\n\nIn the Concordia , Molina introduces the theory of a thorough Thomist like Domingo Bañez (1528-1604) as a mere verbal variant of Scotus's own theory. $^{1}$^{1}$^{2} This  gives  him an occasion to discuss a problem which Scotus struggled with, as we saw above, namely, how an account of divine foreknowledge based on divine decrees avoids the pitfall of either making God the author of sin or rendering him uncertain about bad events. $^{1}$^{1}$^{3} Bañez's own answer introduces a clear asymmetry: God knows that S sins  when he refrains from willing that S acts righteously. But as we saw above, Scotus considered that this cannot provide a secure basis for God's infallible knowledge,  unless  one  claims  that  any  free  creature,  if  left  to  her  own resources, will inevitably sin. But this last concession entails the denial of free will and responsibility. The Thomist opponent of Molina is treated as an extreme version of Scotus's account of foreknowledge, which con fi rms that he interpreted the latter as a deterministic theory.\n\n$^{1}$^{1}$^{1} De scientia Dei ,  ed.  Stegmüller, 238; Concordia ,  disp.  50,  n.  9;  Molina's distinction is similar to the Anselmian distinction between necessitas antecedens and necessitas sequens . Cf.

As  this  aspect  of  his  thought  is  treated  elsewhere  in  the  volume,  I will  give  only  a  rough  sketch. $^{1}$^{1}$^{4} Molina's  central  innovation  consists  in the  introduction  of  middle  knowledge  ( scientia  media ) as  an  intermediary  stage  in  the  divisions  proposed  by  Scotus  and  Aquinas.  The  former distinguished God's natural knowledge of what is necessary and his free knowledge of contingent states of a fairs. Middle knowledge falls between f the natural and the free knowledge. Like Scotus, Molina describes God's natural knowledge as the knowledge, based on the contemplation of his own essence, of what is possible. $^{1}$^{1}$^{5} Natural knowledge and free knowledge are characterized exactly as Scotus did: the content of the former includes all  necessary  states  of  a fairs  and  lies  beyond  the  scope  of  God's  power. f God has free knowledge of what he decrees to create. It is free because (i)  it  could  have  a  di ferent  content  and  (ii)  such  a  change  depends  on f God's  will  ( Concordia ,  disp.  52,  n.  9).  Middle  knowledge  is  then  added to  this  dichotomy  in  order  to  save  creaturely  freedom  as  well  as  God's providence and predestination. According to Molina, God knows before any decision, not only what is possible under any hypothesis considered, but  also  what  creatures  would  do  in  any  situations,  in  particular,  what humans would freely do under such or such a hypothesis. $^{1}$^{1}$^{6} Through his middle  knowledge,  then,  God  knows  not  actual  future  contingents,  but what Molina calls conditional future contingents (FCCs):\n\nAll  contingent  states  of  a fairs  are,  I  repeat,  represented  to  God  naturally, f before any act or free determination of the divine will; and they are represented not only as being possible but also as being future-not absolutely future,  but  future  under  the  condition  and  on  the  hypothesis  that  God\n\n$^{1}$^{1}$^{4} Freddoso ('Introduction,'  46-62)  and  Craig  ( The Problem of Divine Foreknowledge , Chapter 7) provide valuable entries in Molina's version of the doctrine. For later developments within Jesuit theology, see S.K. Knebel, 'Scientia Media. Ein Diskursarchäologischer Leitfaden  durch  das  17.  Jahrhundert,' Archiv  für  Begri fsgeschichte f 34  (1991):  262-94.  For an introduction to middle knowledge discussions within contemporary philosophy of religion, see E. Dekker, Middle Knowledge (Leuwen: 2000).\n\n$^{1}$^{1}$^{6} Evidence for the reality of such a knowledge is given by the biblical story of David and Saul at Keilah (1 Sam. 23:10-12), and Jesus's lamentation at Chorazin and Bethsaida (Matt. 11:21).\n\n$^{1}$^{1}$^{5} De scientia Dei , ed. Stegmüller, 239; God's essence is the primary object of his knowledge; see Concordia , disp. 50, n. 16.\n\nshould decide to create this or that order of things and causes, with these or those circumstances ( Concordia , disp. 50, n. 15, trans. Freddoso, 140).\n\nThat is,  God  knows, under various hypothetical antecedents H ,  whether agent S would  freely  do A or  freely  refrain  from  doing A . Then,  if  he decides to create a world containing H ,  he knows that S will do A . $^{1}$^{1}$^{7} For instance, he knows that, if David stayed in Keilah, Saul would besiege the city,  while  there  is  no  incompatibility  between  David  staying  in  Keilah and Saul not besieging it.\n\nNow,  according  to  Scotus,  natural  and  free  knowledge  are  mutually exclusive  and  jointly  exhaustive,  since  the  root  of  contingency  must  be traced back to God's will. Thus the whole charge against the divine ideas account rested  on  the  claim  that  purely  conceptual  connections  escape the  will's  power  and  are  therefore  necessary. $^{1}$^{2}$^{1} Molina  turns  the  Scotist\n\nThe theory's central tenet is that the truth or falsity of any FCC escapes the control of God's will, and in this respect, middle knowledge is akin to natural knowledge: 'before any free determination of His will, by virtue of the depth of His natural knowledge . . . He discerns what the free choice of any creature would do by its own innate freedom' ( Concordia , disp. 49, n. 11, trans.  Freddoso,  119). $^{1}$^{1}$^{8} However,  FCCs  are  contingently  true,  because their truth depends on what creatures would freely do. $^{1}$^{1}$^{9} The content of middle  knowledge  is  such  that  though  it  escapes  God's  power  it  is  not essentially  so,  and  in  this  respect,  it  shares  common  features  with  free knowledge. $^{1}$^{2}$^{0}\n\n$^{1}$^{1}$^{7} Freddoso  uses  the  device  of  Creation  situations  in  his  presentation  of  Molinism. Intuitively,  the  idea  is  that  God  cannot  create  any  possible  worlds  he  pleases,  but  only those that are part of a Creation situation. As he writes ('Introduction,' 49): 'if God knows prevolitionally in CS w ( ) that Adam will sin if placed in H ,  then He cannot arrange things in such a way that Adam will be in H and yet not sin . . . Over this fact God has no control.'

Prol. q. un., p. 3, n. 169, Vat. I, 112-13).\n\nargument on its back. Since the theory that God's will is the root of contingency  destroys  human  freedom,  the  only  way  to  save  the  latter  is  to claim that knowledge of what free creatures would do in various circumstances is prior to any actual decision on God's part. This, in turn, entails the  denial  of  the  Scotist  claim  that  the  extent  of  God's  will  settles  the limits of what is contingent. $^{1}$^{2}$^{2}\n\nThere are two further points within the theory of scientia  media that need some discussion. First, the theory requires a substantial use of the notion of possible worlds. As we have seen above, although there are elements in Scotus's thought which invite to ascribe him a possible worlds modal framework, nevertheless total states of a fairs or combinations of f unactualized possibilities into uni fi ed worlds do not have a speci fi c role, in part because the notion of compossibility alone does not provide enough resources to  de fi ne a whole possible world. But the main reason is that every contingently uni fi ed ordo rerum is a possible object for God's choice. Thus if it is  possible that the past history of the actual world be exactly as it is now, call it h , and some state of a fairs f s contingently obtains now, then the combination h &amp; not-s is another possible object of God's choice. But then it is indi ferent to say either that God actualizes a collection of f compossible states of a fairs or that he actualizes a complete f ordo rerum . Talk  of  possible  worlds  is  inessential  within  Scotus's  modal  framework. But things change once we say that some FCCs are true independently of God's  choice.  In  Molina,  expressions  like ordo, series  rerum, combinatio , or even mundus are not occasionally mentioned, but systematically used in order to describe complete sets of circumstances that are the object of divine choice. The following passage is especially striking:\n\nGod in  His  eternity  before  the  free  determination  of  His  will  to  create  or produce something, from the intuition of His essence and power, knew by a natural knowledge everything He could do, that He could create this world,\n\n$^{1}$^{2}$^{2} Concordia ,  disp.  50,  n.  15,  trans.  Freddoso,  140:  'and  so  we  disagree  with  Scotus, because  we  hold  that  the  explanation  for  God's  knowing  with  certainty  which  part  of any  contradiction  among  those  contingent  states  of  a fairs . . . is  going  to  obtain  it  not  a f determination of the divine will . . .' Molina's charge in disp. 53 against those who try to account for God's knowledge of FCC through his conditional decrees can be applied to the similar move a Scotist could do. The 17th-century Scotist, Bartolomeo Mastri (also known as Princeps scotistarum), advanced such a view of God's knowing FCCs through his actual decree that if it were that H ,  then S would do A .  Cf. Disputationes theologicae in I librum Sententiarum (Venice: 1684), d. 3, q. 4, a. 4, n. 256; 193b. For Mastri's overall position on the issues discussed here, see J.-P. Anfray, 'Prescience divine, décrets concomitants et liberté humaine d'après Bartholomeo Mastri,' in Saggi sul pensiero fi loso fi co di Bartolomeo Mastri (1602-1673) , ed. M. Forlivesi (Padova: 2006), 555-92.\n\n360\n\n## jean pascal anfray -\n\nand in fi nitely many others that he could create this one in this or that part of  time  or  any  other,  that  He  could  create  in  it  these  angels,  or  in fi nitely many others . . . that He could grant to each single man such or such a complexion, or not this one but another; and so on for the in fi nitely many other orders and combinations of things and circumstances that His omnipotence could do in this universe.\n\nOne should know in addition, that [God] in His eternity and before the determination of His will, by the same natural knowledge stemming from the absolute comprehension and penetration of the things and causes, saw what would be future if He chose to produce this or that order, what any angel, left  to  his  own  free  will,  would  do  by  his  innate  freedom  with  such and such helps and, given these or those occasions and circumstances, what any man . . . would do by his innate freedom, while he could nonetheless do the contrary if he willed so, and under the same set of circumstances, temptations and occasions ( De scientia Dei , Stegmüller, 239).\n\nIn the fi rst paragraph, Molina describes possible worlds as alternatives to God's choice. But the second paragraph shows that even if, for instance, a  world  where  Peter  does  not  deny  Christ  is  a  possible  world,  it  is  not an  object  for  God's  choice,  which  is  restrained  by  what  Peter  would  do under such circumstances. The truth of FCCs (of what some call conditionals of freedom) constitutes a barrier beyond which God's power does not extend. By giving such a prominence to the truth of FCCs over possible worlds, Molina might seem to downplay the idea of a possible world. But this is not so. If some state of a fairs f s depends on what a free creature would do, then God would no longer have a choice between actualizing  world w where h  &amp;  s obtain  and  actualizing  world w' where h  &amp; not-s obtain. Suppose it is true that if it were that h , then it would be that s ,  then  supposing  that  God  wants h to  obtain,  he  must  actualize s .  And since God acts according to an overall providential plan, if he wants some combination of circumstances to obtain, he must actualize all the FCCs that follow from them. This collection describes a unique set of states of a fairs,  and  makes  up  a  single  possible  world.  This  is  especially  imporf tant  to  account  for  the  realization  of  God's  providential  project.  Scotus sees it  as  a  sequential  process,  including  many distinct decrees, ordered according  to instantia  naturae :  thus fi rst  God  wills  the  principal  goal  of creation, namely the Incarnation of his son, and then he predestines some to glory, and fi nally he permits Adam's sin. $^{1}$^{2}$^{3} On the contrary, according to Molina, God knows what would happen in each ordo rerum considered as  a  complete  history  of  the  world  and  makes  a  single  uni fi ed  creation\n\n$^{1}$^{2}$^{3} Scotus, Ordinatio III, d. 7, q. 3, passim, in particular n. 67, Vat. IX, 288-89.\n\ndecree rationally grounded on his scientia media . $^{1}$^{2}$^{4} The end is therefore not  speci fi ed  independently  from  the  means  to  attain  it,  which  entails that, had Adam not sinned, God would not have incarnated himself.\n\nSecond,  from  an  epistemological  point  of  view,  Molina's  account  of middle  knowledge  can  be  seen  as  a  revised  version  of  the  divine  ideas account, as is con fi rmed by his explanation of the medium of God's middle knowledge:\n\nThus with Molina, the notions of asking what would happen in a given world, and thereby of truth in a world, become central. And thus far, the theory  of  middle  knowledge  is  an  important  step  between  the  Scotist notion of a possible logicum and the modern notion of a possible world. $^{1}$^{2}$^{5}\n\nIt  is  absolutely  true  that  the  ideas  (or  the  divine  essence  known  as  the primary object) are the fi rm and certain explanation for the fact that God, who comprehends in the deepest way both Himself and the things that He contains  eminently,  knows  future  contingents  ( Concordia ,  disp.  50,  n.  16, trans. Freddoso, 142).\n\nMolina grants that ideas are not su ffi cient to ground God's foreknowledge of actual future contingents, since a divine decree must be added. Nonetheless, ideas as intellectual representations prior to God's decrees are an appropriate characterization of the object of middle knowledge. $^{1}$^{2}$^{6} Such ideas  are  not  distinct  from  God's  essence,  because  following  orthodoxy, Molina claims that God's knowledge is not taken from things. $^{1}$^{2}$^{7} He  disagrees with those who ascribe to Scotus the idea that God knows things in their objective being understood as a divine production in an esse deminutum .  On  the  contrary,  he  rightly  ascribes  to  Scotus  the  view  that  God's essence  is  the  primary  object  of  his  cognition. $^{1}$^{2}$^{8} However,  he  departs\n\n$^{1}$^{2}$^{4} Commentaria , q. 23, a. 4-5, disp. 1, memb. 7, 313a: 'at ita, propter plenissimam deliberationem,  cognitionemve,  qua  futura  omnia,  ex  hypothesi  praevidebat,  meditandus  est elegisse simul totum ordinem illum.'\n\n$^{1}$^{2}$^{6} Concordia , disp. 50, n. 17-20.\n\n$^{1}$^{2}$^{5} See T.

Thomae partem ,  q.  14,  a.  5  and  6,  disp.  un  (Lyon: 1622), 154a.:  '[intellectus  divinus]  primo  fertur  in  suam  essentiam,  ut  in  obiectum  primarium, in  quo  virtute  continentur  naturae  aliarum  rerum,  et  mediante  essentia  ita  cognita  illo eodem intuitu cognoscit ac intuetur ulterius, ut obiectum secundarium, naturam cuiusque aliarum rerum propriam.'\n\n$^{1}$^{2}$^{8} Commentaria , ibid., 155a.\n\n362\n\nfrom Scotus and aligns with Aquinas, by claiming that ideas as such are not to be identi fi ed with the essences or natures of things, but are identical  with  God's  essence. $^{1}$^{2}$^{9} Molina  justi fi es  this  by  appeal  to  the  further claim  that  the  creatures'  essences  are  not  possible  through  themselves, but owe their possibility to God's power. $^{1}$^{3}$^{0} And this is clearly in opposition to the standard interpretation of Scotus. Moreover, the identi fi cation of  ideas  with  God's  essence  is  closely  connected  to  another  speci fi cally Molinist  claim,  namely  that  God's  knowledge  is  more  perfect  than  its objects,  or  more  precisely,  that,  in  virtue  of  God's  in fi nite  superiority  to the  known  objects,  something  can  be  epistemically  determinate  within God, in other words, God can be certain about it, even if it is metaphysically indeterminate. This property of God's knowledge is what Molina calls supercomprehensio . $^{1}$^{3}$^{1} Without  entering  into  the  intricacies  of  this  doctrine, what is clear is that it is close in spirit to the Neoplatonic thesis that what  is  known  has  the  character  of  the  knower,  so  that  a  most  perfect being can know what is indeterminate in itself. $^{1}$^{3}$^{2} Such an idea somehow comes to the surface in Thomas Aquinas's treatment of God's foreknowledge, when he claims that a thing's mode of being is not necessarily the same as its esse cognitum .  It  entails  that  knowledge with respect to God\n\n$^{1}$^{2}$^{9} Commentaria , q.  15,  a.  1,  disp.  2,  242a:  'comparatione  intellectus  divini  essentia divina propriissime habet rationem ideae creaturarum, et non ipsae naturae rerum. Haec est contra Scotum, Durandum, et reliquos . . .'\n\n$^{1}$^{3}$^{1} The fullest  account  of  the  doctrine  is  to  be  found  in Concordia ,  disp.  52,  n.  11-18. Molina says at n. 11 that 'in order to see which part a free being will turn itself toward . . . what is required is an absolutely profound and absolutely pre-eminent comprehension, such as is  found  only  in  God  with  respect  to  creatures.'  The  chiasm  between  an  object's  intrinsic knowability (its metaphysical determinateness) and the possibility that some in fi nite being be able to know it is clearly a ffi rmed ibid., n. 17: '[that] things that are knowable in the object by their very nature or because of their being, but it is not true of those things that are known in a way exceeding their nature solely because of the eminence and unlimited perfection of the knower.' Cf. Commentaria , q. 16, disp. 1, 246b: 'quia Deus non sumit talem cognitionem suam nec certitudinem illius a rebus ipsis contingenter futuris, quae in utramque partem possunt evenire, sed ex altissima comprehensione rerum ominum in sua essentia, ut in primario obiecto, atque ex in fi nita, omnique ex parte illimitata perfectione sui intellectus eam habet, inde est quo mensura veritatis illius scientiae nulla ratione sit obiectum secundarium, hoc est, essentia divina una cum libera determinatione voluntatis divinae.'  On  this,  see  Freddoso  'Introduction,'  50-53;  Craig, The Problem of Divine Foreknowledge , 179-83.\n\n$^{1}$^{3}$^{0} Commentaria , ibid.: 'exemplar igitur primum, in quo a Deo fi eri posse conspicitur . . . non est ipsamet natura humana habens rationem entis, sed essentia divina, in qua virtute continetur, et cuius potest esse participatio, eam suo modo imitando.'\n\n$^{1}$^{3}$^{2} See  in  particular  Boethius, Consolatio  philosophiae ,  V,  pr.  4,  l.  75-77,  000:  'omne enim  quod  cognoscitur  non  secundum  sui  vim,  sed  secundum  cognoscentium  potius compre  henditur  facultatem.'  To  characterize  this,  Hoenen  1993  (172)  contrasts  such  an epistemo  logical subjectivism with epistemological objectivism.\n\nand to creatures is at most an analogical concept, and in so far, Molina seems  to  share  Aquinas's  conception  of  the  divine  attributes. $^{1}$^{3}$^{3} And  in turn, this is clearly at odds with Scotus's metaphysics and rational theology,  the  starting  point  of  which  lies  in  the  univocity  of  the  concept  of being, of its attributes, and of other perfections. $^{1}$^{3}$^{4}\n\nXII\n\nWhat emerges from this study is that it is almost impossible to give a onesided appraisal of Molina's relation to Scotus. Both thinkers have a strong notion of metaphysical freedom, but they do not articulate it with exactly the  same  metaphysical  hindsight.  The  discussions  around  the  relation of  time  and  modality  and  about  the  grounds  of  knowledge  have  shown that  Molina  is  sometimes  closer  to  ancient  modal  and  cognitive  paradigms than it might have seemed at fi rst glance. However, no account of foreknowledge provides a prima facie so complete reconciliation of God's foreknowledge  with  a  libertarian  view  of  free  will  than  the  doctrine  of middle knowledge. And so, to close this study, we should ask if it is possible to cast some light on Scotus's theory through the lens of Molinism. As  we  saw  above,  some  passages  in  the  Subtle  Doctor  lend  themselves almost  naturally  to  a  quasi-Molinist  reading.  Thus,  in Ord .  II,  d.  34-37, Scotus seems to claim that there is a kind of dependency, more precisely a counterfactual dependency between a creature's free decision and God's decreeing its occurrence, such that, if  the creature had willed di ferently, f so  would  have  God.  Until  now,  this  dependency  has  been  understood along Ockhamist lines. But there might also be a Molinist interpretation if one adds that God knows what a creature would do before (in our way of conceiving) decreeing anything. And so, as Molina himself remarks in at least one place, Scotus's theory, if considered as incomplete, is not incompatible with the Molinist account:\n\nIf  therefore,  Scotus,  when  he  says  that  God  foreknows  future  contingents in the determination of His free will, conceives according to the sense that\n\n$^{1}$^{3}$^{3} See ST I,  q.  14,  a.  6,  ad.  1;  a.  13,  ad.  2.  On  the  analogy  of  divine  attributes,  see ST I, q. 13. See L.J. Elders, The Philosophical Theology of S. Thomas Aquinas (Leiden et al.: 1990). $^{1}$^{3}$^{4} Scotus, Ord .  I,  d.  3,  p.  1,  q.  1-2,  n.  26-55,  Vat.  III,  18-38.  On  the  univocity  of  the concept of being, see the studies in Part IV of Honnefelder et al., John Duns Scotus: Metaphysics  and  Ethics .  In  the  particular  case  of  divine  perfections  like  intelligence  or  will, Scotus claims that in fi nity does not destroy the formal nature of that to which it is added ( Ord . I, d. 8, q. 4, n. 17).\n\n364\n\n## jean pascal anfray -\n\nhas been explained, and that, assuming this natural knowledge by which He eternally  knew  all  future  contingents  in  their  future  being,  not  absolutely but  conditionally  such;  and  if  by  the  free  determination  of  His  will  [God] decided  to  create  this  or  that  order  of  things  with  these  or  those  circumstances, then what he says is true and agrees with ourselves ( De scientia Dei , Stegmüller, 240).\n\nMolina acknowledges that Scotus could be read as claiming that divine decrees provide a su ffi cient ground for God's knowing what will (unconditionally) exist, but that such a free knowledge is preceded by God's knowledge  of  FCC.  This  reading  was  not  uncommon  during  the  17th  century among Scotists. $^{1}$^{3}$^{5} And among recent scholars, those who hold a libertarian interpretation of his teaching on free will are led to ascribe a similar position to Scotus. In other words, in order to fi ll  the gap between God's knowledge  as  based  on  his  decrees  and  the  counterfactual  dependence of his decrees upon what a free creature would do under such and such circumstances, one would have to add something like middle knowledge to  Scotus's  account. $^{1}$^{3}$^{6} In  this  respect,  Molina's  innovations  can  help  to shed new light on the Subtle Doctor's thought.\n\n$^{1}$^{3}$^{5} Especially  important  'Molinist  Scotists'  are  John  Punch  and  Filippo  Fabri.  Cf. Filipppo  Fabri, Disputationes  theologicae (Venice:  1619),  I,  dist.  39,  dispute  53,  n.  22-23, 325b: '. . . contingentia provenire et a voluntate divina, et simul etiam a voluntate creata, quae est causa proxima . . .'; op. cit., disp. 54, n. 42, 337a: 'Molina et alii sentiunt ergo in re cum Scoto'; ibid., n. 50, 338b: 'ad salvandum libertatem nostrae voluntatis, et contingentiam in rebus su ffi cit quod decretum illud divinae voluntatis sequatur praevisionem, quid sit volitura mea voluntas.'\n\n$^{1}$^{3}$^{6} This  is  approximately  the  conclusion  reached  by  Dekker.  See  'Does  Scotus  Need Molina?' 109-10. In the end, however, he thinks that the theory of middle knowledge as a name for the process of God's cognition does not lead further than Scotus's own account in terms of decrees. The theory of middle knowledge only gives a fi ner explanation of the way of reconciling God's foreknowledge and created free will.",

The  Subtle  Doctor's  concepts  and  doctrines  set  the  shape  of  much  of the  discussions  of  the  time,  on  the  nature  and  subject  of  metaphysics, on the freedom of the will, and on the principles of morality. More precisely, Scotus's de fi nition of being qua being as that to which being is not repugnant ( cui non repugnat esse ),  and as a possible being, left a twofold $^{1} legacy to later philosophy: on the one hand, his conception of metaphysics  as  a  transcendental science of the univocal concept of being, and on the other hand the centrality of the notion of freedom, whose fi rst manifestation  is  the  contingency  of  the  world  order.  During  the  Renaissance and  early  modern  period,  those  who  would  qualify  as  Scotists  were  so many that the Cistercian Juán Caramuel Lobkowitz could claim that Scoti schola numerosior est aliis simul sumptis (the school of Scotus counts more than all the other schools taken together).  Not only was the institutional $^{2} authority of Scotus uncontroversial but his thought also exercised a more di fused  in f fl uence.  Jesuit  philosophy  and  theology  was  undoubtedly  the main channel of di fusion for Scotus's  thought  in  the  early  modern  era, f and this, despite the fact that the ratio studiorum of  the  order (1586-99) made  the  study  of  Thomas  Aquinas's  doctrine  the  basis  of  their  theological teaching.  Especially well known is the importance of the Scotist $^{3}\n\n$^{1} See  John  Duns  Scotus, Quodl .  q.  3,  n.  2,  ed.  L.  Wadding  (Lyon:  1639),  XII,  67;  trans. F. Alluntis and A. Wolter, God and Creatures: The Quodlibetal Questions (Princeton: 1975), 61.  Honnefelder, Duns  Scotus (Munich:  2005)  clearly  states  the  twofold  motivation  that underlies Scotus's thought.

He is admittedly one of 'Scotus's intellectual descendants.'  However, the impact of Scotus on the latter is more $^{5} limited in scope and more problematic than with some of his famous fellow Jesuits, like Suárez and Gabriel Vázquez (1549-1604). Indeed, Molina's intellectual production (at least in its extant state) ranges over fewer topics than that of the Doctor eximius .  In particular, the nature of the object of  metaphysics and the discussion of eternal truths and divine ideas do not fi gure among Molina's chief preoccupations. In contrast to this, and somewhat unsurprisingly in the context of post-Tridentine theology, the discussion of the nature of free will and its reconciliation with God's foreknowledge, providence, and predestination is where Scotus's in fl uence on Molina proves most important.  The controversies $^{6} de auxiliis that  arose in reaction to Molina's teachings on grace and predestination in the Concordia provide  evidence  of  an  (at  least  tactical)  proximity  between  the Jesuits and the Franciscans against the Dominicans.  There are thus his$^{7} torical a ffi nities between o ffi cial Scotists and Molinists. But in this chapter  I  will  try  to  give  a  philosophical  assessment  of  the  relation  between Scotus  and  Molina.  Here,  the  notion  of  in fl uence should be understood\n\n$^{4} See  Honnefelder, Scientia  transcendens .  Scotus's  account  of  broadly  logical  modality  (possible  logicum)  constitutes  the  background  of  all  17th-century  discussion  about the divine foundation of modality and the source of eternal truths and about the nature of  possible  beings.  See  T.  Ho fmann,  Creatura  intellecta: f Die  Ideen  und  Possibilien  bei Duns Scotus mit Ausblick auf Franz von Mayronis, Poncius und Mastrius (BGPTM, NF) 60 (Munster:  2002);  J.

Langston, God's Willing Knowledge: The In luence of f Scotus' Analysis of Omniscience (University Park: 1986), at 53. There are not so many studies explicitly devoted to the question of Molina's relation to Scotus. E. Dekker is an exception; see his two papers 'The Reception of Scotus' Theory of Contingency in Molina and Suarez,' in Via Scoti. Methodologica ad mentem Ioannis Duns Scoti , ed. L. Sileo (Rome: 1995), 445-54 and 'Does Scotus Need Molina? On Divine Foreknowledge and Co-Causality,' in John Duns Scotus, Renewal of Philosophy , ed. E.P. Bos (Atlanta: 1998), 101-11.\n\n$^{7} See J.

The $^{9} fi rst  part  of  this  study  provides  a  sketch  of Scotus's theory (sections 1 to 7). In the second part (sections 8 to 13), the results  of  the fi rst  are  confronted  to  Molina's  criticisms  and  to  his  own doctrines.  Finally,  I  will  end  this  conclusion  by  retrospectively  showing how Scotus could be interpreted as reconciling God's foreknowledge and human freedom in a way consistent with Molinism (section 14).\n\nI\n\nThe idea of free will is absolutely central in order to understand Scotus's thought. According to him, the will is essentially a rational power, which means that it is not determined to a single e fect, but instead it is a power f of self-determination. The phrase 'rational power' is taken from Book IX of Aristotle's Metaphysics (1046b4-6), where they are opposed to irrational  powers,  whose  characteristic  feature  is  that  they  are  determined  to a  single  e fect.  For  instance,  given  appropriate  circumstances  (dryness f of  the  atmosphere,  etc.), fi re  burns  wood.  On  the  other  hand  a  rational power  is  such  that,  given  the  same  set  of  circumstances  it  can  either produce  a  given  e fect  or  not  produce  it.  But  Scotus  deeply  transforms f Aristotle's idea. Indeed, according to him, the purely cognitive faculties of\n\n$^{8} The purely historical question of Molina's exact knowledge of Scotus is not addressed here. From the explicit quotations, it appears that Molina knew and read the Ordinatio , especially  Book  I,  dist.  38-39.  I  will  refer  to  the  Vatican  edition:  Ioannes  Duns  Scotus, Opera omnia, studio et cura Commissionis Scotisticae ad fi dem codicum edita (Vatican City: 1950-), referred to as Vat., followed by volume and page number. Whether Molina knew the Quodlibetal Questions and the commentaries on Aristotle, and in particular the Questions on Metaphysics, is more dubious. The Lectura was unknown until its rediscovery by C. Balic in the 1920s. For this reason, I will mostly refer to the Ordinatio .\n\n$^{9} By  a  metaphysic  of  freedom,  I  mean  the  study  of  the  metaphysical  conditions necessary  to  ascribe  freedom  to  a  voluntary  agent,  setting  aside  the  psychological  considerations  that  any  agent  must  satisfy  in  order  to  be  endowed  with  a  will.  Scotus's considerations on free will are not restricted to the purely metaphysical notion of a power of self-determination, but also involve a moral psychological and a speci fi cally ethical perspective; see the texts in Part II of A. Wolter, Duns Scotus on the Will and Morality (1st ed. 1986; Washington: 1997). However Molina's own conceptions in moral psychology are too scattered and cursory to provide a su ffi ciently rich comparison point with Scotus.\n\n328\n\nmind, including the intellect, are irrational in this sense, and are accordingly natural powers ( potentiae naturales ). $^{1}$^{0} The will is the only rational power; it is not subject to causal determinism, and is the only cause of its decisions. $^{1}$^{1} This  involves  a  departure  from  the  Aristotelian  principle according to which every moving thing is moved by something else ( omne quod  movetur  ab  alio  movetur ). $^{1}$^{2} Within  the  Aristotelian  scheme,  only passive potencies (what would be called liabilities), which are unable to actualize by themselves a single e fect, are undetermined: a given piece of f bronze might be shaped as a statue or as a bowl. But according to Scotus, far from betraying an imperfection, the will's indetermination is the hallmark of its excellency, or what Scotus calls a 'superabundant su ffi ciency.' $^{1}$^{3} That  such  a  rational  power  escapes  causal  determinism  but  introduces 'fresh starts' in the causal order of the world is clearly stated by Scotus: 'I say that it is able to do what it does with no conceivable predetermination to act, so that the initial determination, both in the order of nature and in the order of time, occurs in the very placing of its act' ( Questions on Metaphysics , IX, q. 15, n. 66, 000, Will and Morality , 148). Or more brie fl y: 'there is  no  other  cause  [of  the  will's  willing  something  rather  than  something else] to be found except that the will is will' (ibid., n. 29, Will and Morality , 140). Free will is incompatible with causal determinism.\n\nThe existence of such a power of self-determination, and thus of a will, is an intuitive truth, something anyone can experience. $^{1}$^{4} Hence creatures like human beings enjoy free will. But the idea that the will 'could have\n\n$^{1}$^{0} Questions on Metaphysics , IX, q. 15, n. 20-41 ( Opera philosophica vol. III and IV) (New York: 1997), IV, 680-86.

Ho fmann, 'The Distinction between Nature and f Will in Duns Scotus,' Archives d'Histoire Doctrinale et Littéraire 66 (1999): 189-224.\n\n$^{1}$^{2} See Scotus's discussion in Questions on Metaphysics , IX, q. 14, OP IV, 626-73.\n\n$^{1}$^{1} There is disagreement in Scotus scholarship on the respective role of will and intellect in the formation of a volition. Some texts say that intellect and will function as partial co-causes  of  the  volition  (see Lectura II,  d.  25,  q.  un.,  n.  73,  Vat.  XIX,  254),  while  other passages  ascribe  to  the  cognitive  representation  only  the  role  of  a causa  sine  qua  non , leaving  the  will  as  the  total  cause  of  the  volition  ( Rep .  II,  d.  25,  n.  22,  ed.  L.  Wadding [Lyon: 1639], VI, 888). Interpreters disagree over whether these textual di ferences express f a  change  of  opinion  (toward  a  more  radical  voluntarism)  or  not,  and  if  the  answer  to the fi rst  question  is  a ffi rmative,  whether  the  second  position  represents  a  later  stage  of Scotus's thought. For a recent, clear statement of the issue, see Ingham and Dreyer, The Philosophical Vision of John Duns Scotus , 162-72.\n\n$^{1}$^{3} Questions  on  Metaphysics ,  IX,  q.  15,  n.  31,  OP  II,  611, Will  and  Morality ,  140:  'est  et alia superabundantis su ffi cientiae, quae est ex illimitatione actualitatis, vel simpliciter vel quodammodo.'\n\n$^{1}$^{4} Questions on Metaphysics , IX, q. 15, n. 30, OP II, 610.\n\nacted  otherwise'  needs  some  clari fi cation.  Scotus  distinguishes  various senses under which one can be said to be able to will the opposite. First, one may be such that she can have contrary volitions related to the same object,  like  loving  something,  and  later  hating  it.  But  the  will  can  also will di ferent objects: someone who wants to drink may also want to eat. f The fi rst  is  a  power  for  contrary acts, the second is a freedom for di ferf ent objects. Only the latter is essential for freedom, and is found both in God and in creatures, because the former supposes some form of mutability,  which cannot be found in God. $^{1}$^{5} Scotus sets the same distinction in terms of the di ference between not willing ( f non velle ) and willing that not ( nolle ). Thus if I hate something, in some way I refuse it, which Scotus describes as an act of nolition ( nolle ).  But if I freely want to A ,  all  I  need in order to be free, is to be able not to will A .\n\nThere is another crucial distinction concerning the power to act otherwise.  It  can  signify  either  a  manifest  power  to  will  di ferent  acts  and/ f or objects successively, or what Scotus calls a 'not so evident power': the power not to will something at the very instant that one wills something, and vice versa. $^{1}$^{6} The fi rst power is evident: if I swim at some time, I am able to swim even if I am in now in the middle of the desert, provided one indexes the object of the power (i.e. swimming) to a later time than now. But in  order  to  be  free  to  swim,  I  should  have  the  power  to  swim  now, which  I  clearly  lack. $^{1}$^{7} Similarly,  for  my  will  to  be  free,  I  must  have  the power now to refrain from willing what I will. This is a clear consequence of  Scotus's  claim  that  free  will  is  incompatible  with  natural  necessity. $^{1}$^{8} Natural powers are such that given if their causal requisites are present, there is no power at time T for the opposite e fect. By contrast, the will as f a rational power has simultaneously the power to will the opposite or not to will anything at all. However, Scotus does not defend his position via this line of argumentation but instead uses the thought experiment of an angel existing for a single instant of time. This thought experiment allows\n\n$^{1}$^{5} Ord . I, d. 38, p. 2-d.39, q. 1-5 (= I, d.39), n. 15, Vat. VI, 417; n. 21, Vat. VI, 425-26.\n\n$^{1}$^{7} The double time indexing of powers to φ is essential to see how D. Langston is misled when he thinks that powers for Scotus are just abilities, not necessarily including opportunities. Having the power at T to φ at some time or another is enough for a mere ability. But when Scotus claims that freedom of action and/or will requires the power at T to φ at T , this entails that one has the power to φ given the circumstances, which requires that one has the opportunity to exercise the power.\n\n$^{1}$^{6} Ord .

II, 60 : 'Necessitas naturalis non stat cum libertate.'\n\nScotus to disprove any theory that grounds the contingency of an act at T on what happens at any earlier time. Suppose an angel elicits a sinful act. Since sinning requires freedom of the will, this entails that at this very instant, the angel must be able to avoid sinning at this very moment.\n\nII\n\nThe idea of a simultaneous power to will otherwise is only one aspect of a new modal framework which marks a clear departure from older modal paradigms, as Scotus scholars have largely insisted upon. The central feature  of  Scotus's  new  model  is  the  theory  of  synchronic  contingency.  He developed his thought largely in reaction to a form of determinism held by  those  whom  he  names  the  'Philosophers,'  who  promoted  a  broadly Aristotelian  account  of  modality. $^{1}$^{9} A  common  feature  of  these  thinkers was  their  adherence  to  a  version  of  the  Principle  of  Plenitude  (i.e.  no genuine  possibility  remains  unactualized),  which  entails  that  whatever is  eternal  and/or  immutable  is  (absolutely)  necessary.  One  line  of  argument which could lead to this was their strict notion that actualization of  any  potentiality  implies  a  process  of  change.  The  theory  entails  the necessity of the present, expressed by the Aristotelian dictum omne quod est,  necesse  est  esse  quando  est (everything  necessarily  is,  when  it  is, De interpretatione 19a23-27) which is then understood, not as an innocuous conditional  necessity,  but  as  a necessitas  consequentis :  'If A occurs  at T , then it is necessary (from T on) that A occurs at T .'\n\nSince  any  genuine  possible  state  of  a fairs  requires  that  some  actual f potency be able to bring it about, it follows that if some potency is immutable, then whatever results from it, necessarily does so. Therefore, if God is  eternal  and  immutable, then whatever he produces is necessary. As a consequence, contingency is only the result of the impedibility of causal chains relating the fi nite beings, which comes from the essential imperfection of secondary causes.\n\n$^{1}$^{9} Ord .

Normore,  'Duns  Scotus's  Modal  Theory,' in The Cambridge Companion to Scotus , ed. Th. Williams (Cambridge, Eng.: 2003), 129-60.\n\nAccording to Scotus, the latter position is incoherent, for either there is contingency within fi nites things, and so their fi rst cause has to be contingent,  or  God's  productive  action  is  necessary,  and  so  are  its  e fects. f $^{2}$^{0} The background principle of Scotus's fi rst argument is that necessity is a hereditary property: if E is  a  necessary e fect and f E is  a  cause  of E' ,  then E' is  necessary  too. $^{2}$^{1} The  contingency  of  God's  causation  (which  proves according to Scotus that he has will) is a necessary condition of the existence of contingent e fects within the world. Scotus adds two arguments f to  this  one.  The fi rst  is  based  on  the  superiority  of  the fi rst  cause  with respect to any caused event, and the other on the principle that the fi rst cause is able to produce alone any e fect produced by secondary causes. f $^{2}$^{2} Any  state  of  a fairs  that  is  contingent  with  respect  to  secondary  causes f does not cease to be so if it is directly brought about by the fi rst cause.\n\nSince the contingency of our world is a matter of fact, and this cannot consistently  be  denied,  it  follows  that  determinism  is  false. $^{2}$^{3} Moreover, since God acts through his will, and every will is essentially free, it follows that every created e fect is contingent and there is no absolute, but only f relative necessity in the realm of existing things other than God himself. $^{2}$^{4} Contingency is therefore absolutely universal on the one hand and, on the other, it has its root within God's will: 'the divine will is the fi rst ground ( prima ratio )  of  contingency' ( Rep .  I  A,  d.  39-40,  q.  1-3,  n.  35,  ed.  Söder, 248). This does not preclude that there might be other sources of contingency, namely the created wills. $^{2}$^{5}\n\n$^{2}$^{0} Ord .

See Reportatio IA, d. 39-40, n. 30, ed. in J. Söder, Kontingenz, and Wissen (BGPTM, NF) 49 (Munster: 1999), 247.\n\n$^{2}$^{5} Scotus's argumentation at Ord. I,  d.  39,  n.  14,  Vat.  VI,  416  relies  on the possibility of understanding the divine will as a source of contingency on the basis of an understanding of our own created will. This presupposes that the latter are also (limited) sources of contingency. Scotus is even more explicit in Rep. I A, d. 39-40, q. 1-3, n. 36, ed. Söder, 249: 'actus  voluntatis  meae  habet  duplicem causam contingentiae, unam ex parte voluntatis divinae sicut causae primae et aliam ex voluntate mea ut ex secunda causa.'\n\n$^{2}$^{4} Ord .  I,  d.  39,  n.  22,  Vat.  VI,  427:  'ad  quodlibet  ergo  aliud  [ab  essentia  sua]  contingenter  se  habet,  ita  quod  posset  esse  oppositi.'  For  the  relative  necessity  and  absolute contingency of natural events, see Rep. I A, d. 39-40, q. 1-3, n. 38, Söder, 249.\n\nBut  this  contingency  can  be  reconciled  with  God's  immutability  only if  one abandons the model of modality that goes along with the cosmology  criticized  by  Scotus.  In  particular,  he  gives  up  the  necessity  of  the Present. $^{2}$^{6} This  is  clearly  expressed  in  the  following de fi nition of contingency: 'I do not call contingent any non-necessary or non-permanent state of a fairs, but a state of a fairs whose opposite could occur while it occurs' f f ( Ord . I, d. 2, p. 1, q. 1-2 n. 86, Vat. II, 179). The theory of synchronic contingency cannot be separated from the rede fi nition of possibility in terms of logical possibility ( potentia logica ). Some state of a fairs is possible in this f sense if and only if its constitutive elements are nonrepugnant. However, this is never mere logical possibility, since every logical power is actually matched by a real power. And Scotus claims that the will as a real power accompanies the logical possibility of the contrary act. $^{2}$^{7} The  relation  of repugnance is not as strict as logical contradiction, but is closer to semantic incompatibility. For instance, the predicates 'red all over' and 'green all  over'  express  repugnant  properties,  though  their  combination  would not violate any law of logic. $^{2}$^{8}\n\nBy  de fi ning  the  will's  real  power  on  the  basis  of  the  logical  possibility of the two preceding states of a fairs, it might be thought that Scotus f dramatically weakens the 'could have willed otherwise' condition for free will,  in  a  way  that  is  compatible  with  a  compatibilist  conception.  Once again, my swimming now is in itself nonrepugnant, and thus constitutes a possible state of a fairs. All this can be interpreted as a matter of whether f one considers more or less fi ne-grained states of a fairs. If the time index f of the action envisaged and the causal requisites are speci fi ed, then there is indeed some repugnance. For instance, the state of a fairs expressed by f the sentence 'I am at T at a place where none of the conditions required to swim are present and I swim at T ' would be repugnant, and this entails that it is impossible that I swim on this occasion and that I am not free to do it. $^{2}$^{9}\n\n$^{2}$^{6} Restricting  the  latter  to  mere  conditional  necessity,  reinterpreting  the  Aristotelian principle in the following way: 'Necessarily (if A occurs at T , then A occurs at T ).'\n\n$^{2}$^{8} Lectura I, d. 2, p. 2, q. 1-4, n. 246.\n\n$^{2}$^{7} Ord .  I,  d.  39,  n.  16,  Vat.  VI,  418:  'hanc  etiam  potentiam  realem  activam . . . concomitatur potentia logica, quae est non-repugnantia terminorum. Voluntati enim ut actus primus,  non  repugnat  oppositum  velle.'  See Questions on Metaphysics ,  IX,  q.  1-2,  n.  18,  OP IV, 514.\n\n$^{2}$^{9} And so,  when  Scotus  claims  that  a  real  power  is  matched  by  a  logical  possibility, is  not  to  be  read  the  other way round as if the mere per se nonrepugnancy of a state of a fairs  entailed  that  the  agent  has  a  real  power.  To  get  a  real  power,  one  needs  to  add f an extrinsic nonrepugnancy with facts (already existing states of a fairs) to the intrinsic f\n\nThe theory of synchronic contingency must face the charge of violating the law of contradiction. If we suppose that p is true at t and that it is possible at t that p is false at t ,  then, by supposing the possible actualization of notp ,  that would entail that it is possibly true that p is  true at t and p is false at t which is contradictory. In order to avoid such a contradiction, Scotus uses the distinction between the composed and the divides sense. The sentence 'it is possible that S ,  not willing A at T ,  wills A at T ' is true in sensu divisionis but false in sensu composito .  The latter amounts to the contradiction: 'it is possible that ( S wills A at T and that S does not will A at T ).' But in the sense of division, it means that ' S does not will A at T and it is possible at T that S wills A at T ' which is not contradictory, provided one gives up belief in the necessity of the present, and true, since ' S wills that A at T ' is nonrepugnant. $^{3}$^{0} But Scotus goes further and distinguishes an order within the momentary existence of the angel during which he commits a sin. Being free, the sinning angel is able to refrain from sinning at T . However, his act occurs and thus becomes a matter of fact. From the point of view of the agent, the volition is contingent, because he has both the power to sin and the power not to sin. $^{3}$^{1} From the point of view of the volition, it either occurs or not. These two aspects are ordered according to  an  order  of  conceptual priority ( natura prius )  within  a  single  instant. The will, insofar as it is considered as a power for opposites, is naturally prior to its exercising this power one way or the other (Vat. VI, 418). The true proposition corresponding to the divided sense of the sentence thus refers to two distinct instants of nature. As C. Normore summarizes: 'the prior is that in which the angel has both the power to love God and the power to hate God, and the posterior is that in which the angel has actualized  the  power  to  love  God.' $^{3}$^{2} In  a  similar  way,  though  God's  will  is absolutely immutable, he wills contingently his objects, so that while he decides to create A he could at the same time decide to create something else. $^{3}$^{3}\n\nnonrepugnancy.  Scotus  sometimes  calls  the  corresponding  kind  of  necessity necessitas inevitabilitatis . See Rep. I A, d. 39-40, q. 1-3, n. 27, ed. Söder, 246.\n\n$^{3}$^{1} Rational powers are thus endowed with many powers for one e fect. The angel does f not have the contradictory power of sinning and not sinning at the same time, but two powers.\n\n$^{3}$^{0} See Ord . I, d. 39, n. 17, Vat. VI, 419-20.\n\n$^{3}$^{2} C.  Normore 'Duns Scotus's Modal Theory,' 135. See also J.  Schmutz,  'Du  péché  de l'ange à la liberté d'indi férence: Les sources angélologiques de l'anthropologie moderne,' f Les Etudes Philosophiques (2002): 169-98 for uses of the same thought experiment during the early modern period.\n\n$^{3}$^{3} Ord . I, d. 39, n. 22, Vat. VI, 427.\n\nAbandoning  the  necessity  of  the  present  has  important  consequences concerning  the  relationship  between  time  and  modality.  Though  the present is ontologically determinate, it is nevertheless contingent, so that logical determination does not entail necessity. $^{3}$^{4} This undercuts the fatalist inference in De interpretatione ,  Chapter 9, which derives the necessity of  future states of a fairs from the present truth of the propositions corf responding  to  them.  Nevertheless,  Scotus  does  not  completely  separate time and modality. This appears in his reply to the objection that what is past is necessary and unavoidable, so that God's predestination entails that someone who is predestined is unable to sin. Scotus answers by fi rst conceding the necessity of past states of a fairs. f $^{3}$^{5} The underlying intuition is the commonsense assumption that there are no backward-looking powers. However, since God exists in an eternal present, none of his acts passes away. Therefore, God's acts are eternally contingent, so that God can bring it  about  that  if  someone  sins  now  it  will  never  have  been  true  that  he was predestined. But this opens up a possible discrepancy between God's present and ours, or in other words between what is possible for God, and what is possible for us. $^{3}$^{6} If I was in Rome yesterday, there is nothing I can do now to prevent this from having happened. In contrast, God's eternal present coexists with our past, so that from God's perspective what is possible  never becomes impossible. This, in turn, entails a tension over the nature of pastness.\n\nIV\n\nThus far,  we  have  examined  the  nature  of  free  will  and  of  contingency, its root in both divine and created will, and how it fi ts within the modal\n\n$^{3}$^{4} Ord .

Et quando arguitur  quod 'istum praedestinari' transiit in praeteritum, dicendum quod hoc falsum est: si enim voluntas nostra semper haberet eandem volitionem in eodem instanti immobili, non esset sua volitio praeterita sed semper in actu. Et sic est de volitione divina, quae semper eadem est: unde sicut dictum est, eadem volitione qua vult aliquem praedestinare, potest velle  eundem damnari pro eodem instanti aeternitatis. Unde quod dicitur in praeterito, quod Deus praedestinavit, ibi, 'praedestinavit' copulat nunc aeternitatis ut coexistit 'nunc' praeterito.'\n\nframework. Now, we are in a position to turn to Scotus's account of God's knowledge. There is a preliminary problem concerning the scope of Scotus's inquiry. Traditionally, it is thought that Scotus answers two questions: (1) How does God know future contingents? And (2) is God's knowledge of future events compatible with their contingency? Following E. Dekker, we may call the fi rst the Source question, and the second the Reconciliation question. $^{3}$^{7} Some recent interpreters deny that Scotus answers the Source question, and claim that he tried only to solve the Reconciliation question. There is some textual support for this view, $^{3}$^{8} and it has important consequences on the interpretation of Scotus's position as we will see. However, it is di ffi cult not to read some passages as (perhaps incomplete) explanations of how God can be said to have knowledge of what is contingent. $^{3}$^{9} And,  as  will  appear  later,  Molina  understood  Scotus  as  providing  an account  of  the  Source  question.  This  is  why  I  present  Scotus's  account along the traditional interpretation.\n\nScotus  develops  his  own  account  of  foreknowledge  as  an  alternative to  Aquinas's.  The  latter  tried  to  explain  the  compatibility  between  the certitude  of  divine  foreknowledge  and  the  contingency  of  its  objects  by claiming that, though future events, in relation to the 'now of time' ( nunc temporis ), are not yet actual and thereby contingent, they are nevertheless present to the now of eternity ( nunc aeternitatis ),  and from this point of view their occurrence is determinate and necessary and can be the object of  a  certain  knowledge. $^{4}$^{0} The  idea  of  temporal  things  coexisting  within God's eternity is the core of the theory. Eternity is agreed to be some kind of nonsuccessive duration. $^{4}$^{1} What is contentious is the notion of eternal presence. According to Scotus's realist interpretation, God, being eternal, is present to all the moments of time, and hence, to all events, past, present, and future. $^{4}$^{2} This presence implies a form of simultaneity. Therefore\n\n$^{3}$^{7} See E. Dekker, 'Does Scotus Need Molina?'\n\n$^{3}$^{9} See Rep . I A, d. 38, q. 1-2, n. 11, ed.

XVII,  500; Ord .  I, d. 39, n. 22, Vat. VI, 427: 'restat videre secundum principale, qualiter cum hoc stat certitudo scientiae' (cf. n. 12, Vat. VI, 413).\n\n$^{4}$^{0} Thomas Aquinas, Summa contra Gentiles ,  I,  c.  66-67 and Summa Theologiae I, q. 14, a. 13, in corp.\n\n$^{4}$^{2} Lectura I, d. 39, n. 23, Vat.

Bieler [Corpus Christianorum Series Latina] 94/1 [Turnhout: 1957], V, pr. 6, l.9-11). See Thomas Aquinas, SCG I, c. 66, n. 7; ST I, q. 10, a. 4, in corp.\n\n336\n\nthings are present in themselves ( in seipsis ) to God, which entails that all moments of time somehow exist tenselessly in the now of eternity, as the points on the circumference of a circle are equidistant to its center, which can be represented as God's eternal now.\n\nWe may now turn to Scotus's positive account. According to him, God's knowledge contains three moments, or instants of nature. The fi rst stage is God's natural knowledge of all necessary propositions. At this stage, every logical possibility is an object of God's knowledge, which depends only on\n\nScotus's objections are based on a dynamical conception of time, according to which the f luxus temporis is an objective feature of existence. $^{4}$^{3} Suppose one starts with the assumption that God coexists with some event E .  This means that God is somehow simultaneous with E occurring at T . Now, if God is present to another event E' ,  occurring at T' future relative to T , then God is simultaneous with E' , and, by the transitivity of simultaneity, E and E' would be simultaneous too, which destroys their temporal order. Furthermore, E' would be real at T , and then it would be impossible for God to create it at T' .  And one could not reply that E '  is  not  yet  real, though  simultaneous  with  God's  eternity,  for  simultaneity  being  a  real relation  requires  that  its  terms  really  exist. $^{4}$^{4} Pace the  parallel  with  the case of immensity, Scotus considers that God's immensity entails that he is present to all existing places, not to possible but nonactual places. Likewise, God's eternity does not entail that nonactual times, like the future, are present to him, only that they will be, when they will be actualized. $^{4}$^{5} Another  objection  is  that  if  God  knew  contingent  events  only  because he perceives them somehow when they are present, then his knowledge would  be  imperfect,  and  could  not  ground  his  providence. $^{4}$^{6} Finally,  if mere coexistence were su ffi cient  to  ground  foreknowledge of the future contingent  states  of  a fairs,  the  angels  would  naturally  foreknow  them, f which is denied by Aquinas himself. $^{4}$^{7}\n\n$^{4}$^{3} See Rep . IA, d. 38, n. 28, ed. Söder, 231: 'tempus sic fl uat quod non habet existentiam post fl uxum. Si nihil  remaneret  nisi  punctus,  ergo  nihil  circumferentiae  coexistit  centro nisi punctus.'\n\n$^{4}$^{5} Is  the  present  the  only  real  time,  as  the  circle  metaphor  suggests  (cf.  Lectura  I, d. 39, n. 85, Vat. XVII, 507; Ord . I, d. 39, n. 35, Vat. VI, 441), or does Scotus grant reality to the past as well? His remarks on the determination and necessity of the past (cf. Ord . I, d. 39, n. 26, Vat. VI, 432) tend to show that past events and states of a fairs are somehow real. See f N.  Lewis,  'Space  and  Time,'  in The  Cambridge  Companion  to  Scotus ,  ed.  Th.

Consider the terms of the relations  of  repugnance  and  compossibility.  These  are  logically  simples and are sometimes called by Scotus notae . Such notae are related to others according to repugnance or compossibility, independently of any power to bring them about. $^{4}$^{8} However, they are not self-subsistent entities, but are  the  products  of  God's  intellectual  activity,  which  thus  endows  them with an ontological status, as intelligible beings. But the logical and modal properties of these entities are not constituted by God's intellectual activity.  Scotus  summarizes  this  by  claiming  that  the possibilia are  formally such from themselves ( formaliter ex se ), but 'principially' from God ( principiative  ab  eo ). $^{4}$^{9} All  logical,  mathematical,  and  metaphysical  truths,  in general all necessary truths, are known at precisely the instant when God produces, thinks things, and produces them in an esse intelligibile .  Moreover,  since  the  relations  of  compossibility  and  repugnance  are  independent  from  God's  intellectual  activity,  any  modal  truth  is  necessarily  so. This  entails  that  anything  possible  is  necessarily  possible.  According  to Scotus, all combinations of compatible notae are objects of God's knowledge,  which  he  calls  also  ideas. $^{5}$^{0} Scotus  is  less  explicit  on  the  content of  ideas  than  on  their  ontological  status,  but  it  is  likely  that  an  idea  is an  intellectual  representation  of  any  object,  either  of  an  individual  like 'Socrates' or of a common nature like 'man' and that it contains everything  that  can  be  grasped  by  God  through  his  intellect  alone.  An  idea would be something like the deductive closure of all necessary truths concerning a given object. For instance, God's intellect produces the notae of animality and rationality and these, being intrinsically nonrepugnant, can be combined in a single subject, man. And man can be combined with an individual di ferentia to produce a possible individual, say 'Socrates.' The f idea  of  Socrates  contains  all  the  properties  grounding  necessary  truths concerning him: that he is a man, that he is a rational animal, and that it\n\n$^{4}$^{8} Ord . I, d. 36, q. un., n. 60-61, Vat. VI, 296. On what follows, see C. Normore, 'Scotus, Modalities, Instants of Nature and the Contingency of the Present,' in John Duns Scotus. Metaphysics and Ethics , ed. L. Honnefelder, R. Wood, and M. Dreyer (STGM) 53 (Cologne: 1996), 161-74.\n\n$^{5}$^{0} Ord . I, d. 35, n. 42, Vat. VI, 263: 'ipsum obiectum cognitum est idea.' Scotus borrows the traditional Platonic terminology, but gives it a very di ferent meaning. Against Henry f of Ghent, he claims that ideas are not ontologically independent entities, enjoying an esse essentiae ( Ord .  I,  d.  36,  n.  34,  Vat.  VI, 284). And against Aquinas, Scotus claims that ideas are not exemplar forms, guiding God's practical knowledge of his creation. See Rep .  I  A, d. 36, q. 3, passim in T. Noone, 'Scotus on Divine Ideas: Rep. Paris. I-A, d.36,' Medioevo 24 (1998): 359-453.\n\n$^{4}$^{9} See Ord . I, d. 43, n. 18, Vat. VI, 369.\n\n338\n\nis possible that he is sitting at T ,  and so on. However, it does not include the property of sitting at T , because it is a contingent truth.\n\nAt this stage of the process, contingent propositions form pairs of contradictories which are disjunctively necessary, therefore true, but none of which  is  true  nor  false.  Each  member  of  such  disjunctions  is  a  neutral proposition that lacks a truth-value. $^{5}$^{5} This, however, does not amount to a  restriction of the Principle of Bivalence (PB), because this stage corresponds to an instant of nature, and there is no time at which contingent propositions lack truth-values. $^{5}$^{6} At this stage there are possible states of a fairs  and  true  propositions f de  possibili ,  but  there  are  literally  no  contingent  states  of  a fairs  nor  true  contingent  propositions  corresponding f\n\nThis  leads  Scotus  to  reject  theories  that  ground  God's  knowledge  of future  contingents  on  his  ideas. $^{5}$^{1} First,  they  can  ground  only  analytical, thus necessary truths. $^{5}$^{2} Moreover, ideas are intellectual representations, excluding any volitional element. They are therefore purely natural occurrences  in  God's  mind.  Since  God's  will  is  the  only  root  of  contingency, it  follows that ideas necessarily have their content and cannot ground a representation of contingent states of a fairs. f $^{5}$^{3} Conversely, suppose that God's knowledge of future contingents were based on ideas, then he would not be omniscient, for he would know that Socrates could be either sitting or standing up at T ,  not that he is sitting at T .  Finally, there would be no more di ference between God's knowledge of what is actual and of what f is simply possible. The thrust of Scotus's criticism is his claim that being a  purely  intellectual,  prevolitional,  representation  and  being  the  representation  of  something  contingent  are  incompatible  properties.  Since  it is  a  natural  power,  God's  intellect  can  ground  neither  the  truth  nor  the knowledge of anything contingent. $^{5}$^{4}\n\n$^{5}$^{1} It can be attributed to Bonaventure, In Sent .  I,  d. 38, a. 2, q. 2, concl.; d. 39, a. 2, q. 3, 000; but also to Aquinas ( De veritate q. 3, a. 1-8; In Sent . I, d. 38, q. 1, a. 3, ad. 1) and Henry of Ghent ( Quodl .

At  136 f., f he  discusses  a  similar  objection  from  Gregory  of  Rimini, Lectura I,  d.  38,  q.  2,  a.  2,  ed. D. Trapp - V. Marcolino (Berlin: 1981) III, 281.\n\n$^{5}$^{5} Scotus speaks of a complexio neutra :  see Ord .  I,  d.  39,  n.  23,  Vat.  VI,  428; Lectura I, d. 39, n. 44, 62-65; 75, 90; Rep . I A, d. 38, q. 1-2, n. 37, ed. Söder, 233.\n\nto  them. This alethic (and a fortiori ontological) indetermination entails an epistemic indetermination: in the fi rst  instant  of  nature,  God  has  no determinate knowledge of what is contingent. $^{5}$^{7}\n\nIt may be remarked that Scotus is not very explicit on the combinations of  simple  states  of  a fairs.  Compossibility  is  the  fundamental  relation. f Since it is de fi ned in terms of non repugnantia alone, it is not a transitive relation (i.e. it is possible that A is compossible with B and B compossible with C and yet A is not compossible with C ). Compossibility alone is therefore not rich enough a relation to partition all possible states of a fairs into f maximal collections of states of a fairs,  or  possible  worlds.  At  this  level, f there seem thus to be possible situations, but not what we would call possible worlds. There is however a privileged class of states of a fairs, those f that get actualized through God's choice. This can be described as a complete possible situation and Scotus sometimes uses the phrase ordo rerum to characterize it. Therefore at least the actual world is similar to a possible world. Moreover, Scotus sometimes speaks of various ordines rerum each corresponding to some hypothetical exercise of God's ordained power. $^{5}$^{8} Though this might look a bit speculative, one could interpret that as the tacit  recognition  that  just  as  the  states  of  a fairs  constituting  the  actual f ordo rerum are selected through God's will, the other ordines are de fi ned by which states of a fairs God could decide to co-create. In this respect, it f is not inappropriate to see Scotus's modal framework as an anticipation of modern possible world modal semantics and metaphysics. $^{5}$^{9} Just as God's intellect  constitutes  the  ontological  ground  to  his  knowledge  of  necessary truths, his will is the root of his knowledge of contingent truths. This means that God produces some states of a fairs in a 'willed being' ( f esse volitum ) which only actual states of a fairs enjoy, and that he determines f through  his  will  which  contingent  propositions  are  true,  and  which  are false. He decides to actualize one of the states of a fairs corresponding to f any pair of contradictory neutral propositions. By actualizing such a state\n\n$^{5}$^{7} Rep. I A, d. 38, q. 1-2, n. 37, ed. Söder, 233.\n\n$^{5}$^{9} See D.C. Langston, God's Willing Knowledge and S. Knuuttila, Modalities in Medieval Philosophy .  I  would share C. Normore's verdict: 'although one can fi nd the ingredients in Scotus's picture for talking about possible worlds, the notion would do little or no work within that picture itself' ('Duns Scotus's Modal Theory,' 155). See below, section 12, for additional reservations.\n\n$^{5}$^{8} Talking about the nature of God's ordained power, Scotus claims for instance in Ord I, d. 44, q. un., n. 8, Vat. VI, 366: ' fi eret ordinate secundum alium ordinem, quem ordinem ita posset voluntas divina statuere sicut potest agree.' This alius ordo is clearly a maximal collection of compossible states of a fairs. f\n\nof  a fairs,  God's  will  makes  the  corresponding  proposition  true,  and  its f contradictory false. God's will is thus somehow the truth-maker of every true contingent proposition. $^{6}$^{0} It is an appropriate truth-maker, since it is a rational power: while he wills that some proposition p is true, he could at the same time will that p is  false. Let us summarize through an example: eternal happiness and its negation are both compossible with Peter's essence, and so in a fi rst instant of nature, God knows that it is possible that Peter is happy, and that it is possible that Peter is miserable. Then, in  a  second instant of nature, God decrees that Peter should be granted eternal happiness, thereby making true 'Peter will be happy.' Finally, in a third instant of nature, God knows through his intellect that Peter will be happy. $^{6}$^{1} In the three versions of his commentary on Sentences I, d. 39, Scotus adds a modi fi ed version in order to avoid the charge of introducing discursivity  within  God's  intellect,  which  would  compromise  the  latter's simplicity.  In  the  second  version,  God  does  not  infer  knowledge  of  contingent propositions on the basis of the knowledge of his own decrees. $^{6}$^{2} Rather, while he decrees that p rather  than not-p is  true  (for  contingent p ), his essence represents ipso facto the truth of p and is the whole ratio cognoscendi of any such truth. $^{6}$^{3}\n\nV\n\nThe solution proposed by Scotus to the Source question seems straightforward, but when we turn to the Reconciliation problem, matters become\n\n$^{6}$^{0} The  phrase esse  volitum appears  in Ord .  I,  d.  39,  n.  31,  Vat.  VI,  439.  On  God's  will as  a  truth-maker  for  contingent  truths,  see Ord . I,  d.  39,  n.  23,  Vat.  VI,  428:  'voluntas eligens  unam  partem . . . facit  illud  esse  determinate  verum  'hoc  erit  pro a ' ';  ibid.  Vat.

As  Beck ('Divine Psychology and Modalities,' 130) rightly observes, truth is an absolute notion and God's will is factive, so that what God decrees is actual and therefore true. This means that what is merely possible is, strictly speaking not true.\n\n$^{6}$^{2} Ord .  I,  d.  39,  n.  23,  Vat.

Suppose that God has decreed that p (e.g. 'Agent S wills A at T '),  and thereby foreknows it. If the agent is free, this seems to entail that he could exercise his power of not willing A at T .  But then, either he would do something contrary to God's knowledge which would threaten  his  infallibility, $^{6}$^{4} or  God's  decree  that p would  not  be  a  su ffi -cient condition for his knowing that p .  William Ockham argued that the theory  leads  to  a  dilemma:  either  God's  decree  is  a  su ffi cient  condition for God's knowledge, but then no one's act is necessitated by it, and it is not possible to act contrary to what one actually does; or one is free and then God's knowledge is not secured by the determination of his will. $^{6}$^{5} The synchronic theory of contingency guarantees that p is  contingent in itself, insofar as it proceeds from an ever-present decree of God. However, this  contingency is just an e fect of God's contingent willing, who, or so f it  seems,  is  the  only  being  endowed  with  actual  free  will.  Thus  Scotus's theory, though it leaves room for some form of contingency, $^{6}$^{6} would rule out the existence of created free will satisfying the conditions set out by Scotus.  This  has  led  some  Scotus  scholars  to  suspect  that  his  theory  is inconsistent. $^{6}$^{7} According to others, the theory is consistent, because Scotus is in e fect a proponent of (theological) determinism. Appearances notf withstanding, Scotus would not develop a libertarian notion of free will, and the notion of a power for contraries must be understood as requiring nothing  more  than  a  mere  ability  (or  even  the  mere  logical  possibility) to  act  in  a  contrary  way. $^{6}$^{8} Finally,  some others embrace a diametrically opposed interpretation and maintain that Scotus is a full-blown libertarian  with  respect  to  human  free  will.  But  then,  one  is  obliged  to  answer Ockham's challenge on Scotus's behalf. $^{6}$^{9}\n\n$^{6}$^{4} See Ord .  I,  d.  39,  n.  24,  Vat.  VI,  429-30; Rep .

Langston believes that Scotus's notion of freedom involves two claims: (i) the agent has the ability to perform A and the ability to refrain from A ;  and (ii) the agent wills the performance (or the refraining) in accordance with his nature.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn order to grasp Scotus's solution to this dilemma, one needs to turn to the problem of God's foreknowledge of evil actions or sins. This problem is  extensively discussed in other passages, especially in the commentary on Sent .  II,  d. 37. $^{7}$^{0} Scotus discusses a strongly libertarian and incompatibilist position, which the Vatican editors ascribe to Peter John Olivi. $^{7}$^{1} The core thesis is the a ffi rmation that the will can be free only if it is absolutely undetermined,  in  other  words,  only  if  it  is  a causa  totalis  et  immediate respectu suae volitionis .  The  position  discussed  by  Scotus  holds  thus  the following claim:\n\nIf agent S has it within his power to will A , then there cannot be a causal requisite R of S' willing such that (i) A cannot occur without R's causing and (ii) R is not within S' power.\n\nArmed with this principle, Olivi argues that if God's willing were a condition satisfying (i) it would also satisfy (ii), and therefore exclude S' freely willing.  The  reason  is  that  God's  will  exists  eternally  so  that  our  temporally limited willing could not control it. Scotus concedes that Olivi's position  provides  an  easy  answer  for  excusing  God  from  the  responsibility of  evil. $^{7}$^{2} But  it  cannot  be  reconciled  with  the  exclusive  role  of  God  in predestination, and more generally, with the idea of hierarchy of causes. Moreover,  it  would  undermine  the  infallibility  of  God's  knowledge  of future contingents, if it is based on God's knowledge of his own decrees. This  leads  Scotus  to  provide  an  alternative  account.  In  order  to  achieve that, he uses the device of partial causes cooperating to produce a single e fect. f $^{7}$^{3} There is nothing new to the idea that God's action is necessary to sustain the created world's existence and causal activity within it. What is distinctive of Scotus's position is the way he integrates his account within a  general  theory  of  partial,  cooperating  causes. $^{7}$^{4} In  general,  he  distin-\n\ninterpreters,  see  A.

II, d. 34-37, q. 5, n. 117 and n. 142-43.\n\nguishes three ways distinct causes might be ordained in the production of a single e fect. Accidentally ordained causes are such that a single cause f could independently produce the whole e fect if its power were intensif fi ed,  as  when  two  horses  are  needed  to  pull  a  cart,  one  of  them  could nevertheless su ffi ce, provided he were strong enough. The next two cases concern essentially ordered causes. Sometimes, the causal activity of the subordinated cause is wholly consequent upon the fi rst  cause's  activity. This  happens  when,  for  instance,  the  hand  moves  a  sta f:  the  sta f  has f f no motion of its own, but only as it is acted upon by the hand. $^{7}$^{5} Finally, the  two  causes  sometimes  play  an  essentially  distinct  and  complementary causal role, though one is ontologically superior to the other. As an example, Scotus mentions the generation of a child, which requires the actions of both the father and the mother as its immediate causes, though the male is considered as intrinsically superior to the female.\n\nIn  the  present  case,  God  and  the  created  will  can  be  considered  as two  partial  cooperating  causes  of  the  third  kind.  Contrary  to  Aquinas's account, God's will does not act directly on the created will, but cooperates with the latter in order to produce a single volition. From this point of view, the actualization of a causal power does not need the in fl uence of the fi rst cause, except for its sustaining in existence. This remains vague, however, for God's primacy could still imply some way of determining the created  will's  causation.  But  God  would  be  guilty  of  sin  if  his  causation were the root of the de fi ciency constitutive of the sinful action. With the help of this idea, Scotus develops his own solution to the problem of God's concurrence to sin. It is worth quoting at length:\n\nThus, if the created will and the divine will concur to the created will's willing, there can be a defect in the willing itself due to the defect of one of the two causes. And from this 000, because this cause could give rectitude to its act, and is bound to give, but nevertheless does not, while the other cause, though it is not bound to give it, nevertheless 'so far as it is in itself ' ( quantum est ex se ),  would give it, if the created will were to cooperate. Indeed,\n\ncognition and then again. In Lectura II,  d.  25,  n.  71-73,  Vat.  XVII,  253-54, Scotus pictures the  intellect  and  will  in  the  production  of  a  volition  as  two  partial,  cooperating  causes. See above n. 000.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\neverything God gave antecedently, He would give consequently (so far as it is in Himself), unless there should be an impediment. By giving to the free will,  He  gave  antecedently  the  right  works  ( opera recta )  which  are  within the  will's  power.  And  thus,  as  for  His  part,  He  gave  rectitude  to  every  act of will-and He would give consequently to the will, if the will itself were to cause rightly any elicited act as for its part ( ex parte sui ). . . . The superior cause quantum est ex se would cause, if the inferior would cause according to its own causality ( Ord . II, d. 34-37, q. 5, n. 143-44, Vat. VIII, 428-29).\n\nAccording  to  this  passage,  neither  evil  acts  would  occur  without  a  created  will's  causality,  nor  would  righteous  action  without  God's  concurrence. To understand the whole process, one needs to start from the will's power for opposites. (i) If S actualizes her power for A , and A is right, God would concur with S by producing the needed rectitude in A . But (ii) if S actualizes her power for notA ,  then God would not concur with S .  As  a consequence, S' action would not be right nor meritorious, and S would sin,  because he could have chosen to actualize A instead.  The combination  of  (i)  and  (ii)  entails  a  kind  of  counterfactual  dependency  of  God's will (which is presupposed by his concurrence and foreknowledge) upon the created will's choice. In case (i), God wills that A , whereas in case (ii), God is said only to permit A .  This  dependency  is  asymmetrical,  for  it  is not required in the case of the meritorious actions of the predestined, but only to explain how one can excuse God from any responsibility for sin. One might wonder if the discussion of this issue does not rest on a di ferf ent account of foreknowledge from the one explicitly developed earlier. Indeed, according to Scotus:\n\n- (1) f I S is free and wills A , then (i) God eternally foreknows that S wills A and (ii) if S had not willed A , God would have foreknown that S does not will A .\n\nIf  one  maintains that foreknowledge is based on a divine decision, then (ii) amounts to:\n\n- (1') ii')  If ( S had not willed A ,  then God would have decreed that S does not will A .\n\nBut then there seems to be a covariance of God's decrees with the creatures'.  If  one  reminds  that  God's  decrees,  being  eternal,  never  fade  into past, and remain forever contingent, one might conclude that the power not to will A remains within S' power even if it is foreknown that S shall\n\nwill A . Scotus's position as it is exposed in this passage is consonant with a  form  of  libertarianism,  though  not  of  the  extreme  incompatibilism defended  by  Olivi.  He  would  modify  the  latter's  condition  for  freedom, by revising the power condition: some requisite might be such that they are  neither  within  the  will's  power  nor  independently  given.  This  new account  has  the  advantage  of  rendering  God's  foreknowledge  and  the will's  freedom  compatible,  and  enabling  to  answer  Ockham's  challenge. The trouble is that, though not inconsistent with the 'o ffi cial'  view,  this account departs from the latter's greater intelligibility as a theory of how God knows future contingents. For such an infallible covariance without any dependence of God's will upon knowledge of the creature's decisions runs the risk of looking either as something like a cosmic coincidence or a pure mystery of faith. $^{7}$^{6}\n\n## VII\n\nWe are now in a position to grasp Molina's relation to Scotus's thought. To begin with, I shall examine Molina's conception of free will and divine concurrence, where Scotus's in fl uence is most explicit. Then I will examine  the  criticisms  raised  by  the  Jesuit  against  the  Subtle  Doctor  against the latter's account of foreknowledge. Finally, after a brief examination of Molina's theory of foreknowledge, I will try to assess, beyond the apparent points of agreement and criticisms, the deep-level relations between these two thinkers.\n\nMolina's  de fi nition  of  free  will  ( liberum  arbitrium )  clearly  has  Scotist roots. Both consider the will as both the locus and the source of freedom, against the preeminence of the intellect, which characterizes the Thomistic\n\n$^{7}$^{6} Whatever its obscurities, many theologians of the Renaissance, under the in fl uence of Scotus, articulated such a theory of concomitant decrees. Among others, the Franciscans Antonio de Cordoba and Andrés de Vega proposed such views. Cf. Antonio de Cordoba, Quaestionarium theologicum , I, q. 55, dub. 11-12, 000; Andrés de Vega, Tridentini decreti de Iusti fi catione expositio et defensio ,  000 (Alcala: 1564), 000; Andrés de Vega in Anfray 2004, 202, n. 57. According to the latter, if the will is free, then if S wills A , then God has decreed that S would  will A ,  but S has  the  power  not  to  will A ,  and  if  he  actualized  this  power, then God would have eternally decreed that S would not have willed A . Among the Jesuits, Gabriel Vázquez seems to have developed an answer to the foreknowledge dilemma based on such concomitant decrees (000).\n\n346\n\n## jean pascal anfray -\n\ntradition. $^{7}$^{7} Will is a free cause according to Molina. $^{7}$^{8} It enjoys a freedom from necessity which is de fi ned in the following way:\n\nThat  agent  is  free,  which,  when  all  requisites  for  acting  are  present,  can act  and  not  act,  or  act  in  such  a  way  that  it  can  equally  act  in  a  contrary way.  And  it  is  because  of  such  a  freedom  that  the  faculty  through  which such an agent can act this way is said to be free. . . . And free will ( liberum arbitrium ) . . . is  nothing  else  but  the  will,  which  is  formally  free  according to our de fi nition, when it is preceded by a judgment of reason ( Concordia , disp. 2, n. 3, ed. Antwerpen, 8a).\n\nAlthough Molina does not give up the requirement of rationality in order that a being be free, his de fi nition shows that the essential property of a free agent is that her actions do not occur deterministically. That is to say, if agent S is  free, then there is no set of requisites R prior to S' s choosing some  course  of  action A such  that R entails  that S wills  that A .  This  is Molina's way of understanding freedom as a potestas ad opposita , a power for  opposites. $^{7}$^{9} Molina's  insistence  on  the  fact  that  such  a  power  is  to be understood in sensu composito shows that free will does not involve a simple ability fl owing from the nature of the agent, but also the presence of a real opportunity. For instance, someone who is constantly chained to a  seat  during an interval of time T ,  thereby loses her power to stand up and is therefore not free during T . $^{8}$^{0} On the contrary, if she desires to sit\n\n$^{7}$^{7} Concordia ,  disp.  2,  n.  9.  I  will  quote  from A.J. Freddoso's translation when possible. In other cases, I will refer to the second edition of the work in the Antwerpen edition of 1595.\n\n$^{7}$^{9} Concordia , disp. 2, n. 3; cf. disp. 53, memb. 2, n. 17.\n\n$^{7}$^{8} Concordia , disp. 24, n. 8.\n\n$^{8}$^{0} D. Langston acknowledges this, and considers that Molina departs from Scotus on this  score  (see God's willing  Knowledge ,  67).  But  one  must  be  cautious  here,  for  if  some situation H is  such  that  one  would  certainly  choose  some  de fi nite  course  of  action,  one does not lose one's freedom, if some distinct agent actualizes and maintains situation H . If I were presented a box of chocolate, I would take one, but I do not lose my free will just because I am repeatedly o fered some, and do not decline any. Molinist free will entails f the power to will the opposite of what one actually wills in certain circumstances, not the power to control the circumstances where one fi nds himself into.  The theory of middle knowledge ( infra ) rests on this idea: an agent, having both the ability and the opportunity to will the opposite in a situation H , is such that if placed in H , he would (freely) do A and some agent, say God, knows this and has the power to ensure that S is placed in H . Moreover, one could exploit this idea to reinterpret some passages where Scotus claims that the blessed in heaven are free to love God, though he prevents them from sinning ( Ord . IV, d. 49, q. 6, n. 11, Wadding X, 455). According to Langston the situation is analogous to the case where someone is chained to a seat and, while having an ability to stand up, is deprived of the opportunity to do so ( God's willing Knowledge , 40-41, 50, and 122-23). Scotus's own example of the eye retaining the power to see the sky, in spite of the presence of a perpetually intervening obstacle, apparently comforts Langston's interpretation. But it is possible\n\nand sees that there is nothing wrong to this, then she is free only if these psychological (and other causal) requirements do not entail that she will sit, but leave it open for her to stand up. This feature explains why Molinist  freedom is also called freedom of indi ference, which means that the f motives presented by the intellect do not determine the will to its choice. $^{8}$^{1} Molina argues as Scotus did, that the existence of free will is a matter of psychological experience and cannot be rationally denied. $^{8}$^{2}\n\nFinally,  Molina  subscribes  to  Scotus's  idea  of  a  non-evident  power  of the will to simultaneously will A and not will A . This is the central thrust of  disputation  24  of  the Concordia , where  Molina  overturns  Ockham's arguments against the idea of a synchronic power for opposites. Ockham had objected to Scotus's non-evident power for opposites, that it entails a denial of the law of contradiction and refused to countenance instants of nature. According to Ockham, one is free to will either of two contradictory courses of action before the time T when the volition is elicited. But at T , if one wills A , this makes refraining from A impossible. In other words, dual possibility is essentially forward-looking. $^{8}$^{3} According to Molina, this entails  that  one  is  free  just  before  one  acts,  but  not  at  the  time  when an  act  is  elicited.  Since  he  assumes  that  one  is  responsible  for  an  act A occurring at T ,  only  if  one  is  free  at T ,  he  infers  that  Ockham's denial of the Scotist simultaneous power for opposites leads to a denial of responsibility. Moreover, Molina rehearses Scotus's case of the angel existing for a  single  instant  of  time,  or  of  the  actual  angels  at  the  moment  of  their creation. $^{8}$^{4} According  to  Molina,  such  an  angel  is  free  at  this  moment, otherwise he could not be responsible for what he does. He avoids falling into contradiction by using the Scotist device of the distinction of many instantia naturae within a single temporal instant. $^{8}$^{5} While he wills A at T , such an angel must also have at T the power to refrain from A . This power\n\nto understand Scotus di ferently (by extrapolating a bit from Scotus's f fi nal answer ibid. n. 15, Wadding X, 457), if one considers it as a situation where God constantly maintains the situation under which he knows that the blessed will freely avoid sinning. The distinction here is very like the one proposed by Freddoso, 26-28.\n\n$^{8}$^{2} Concordia , disp. 23, memb. 1, Antwerpen, 89b-90a.\n\n$^{8}$^{1} See Concordia , disp. 2, n. 6, Antwerpen, 8b and n. 9, Antwerpen, 9a.\n\n$^{8}$^{3} Ockham, Ordinatio , I, d. 38, q. un., OTh IV, 581.\n\n$^{8}$^{5} Concordia disp. 24, n. 8. Such instants are o ffi cially distinct by a distinction of reason, for Molina clearly says elsewhere that it is: 'priority in our way of conceiving it, but with a basis in reality' Concordia , disp. 53, pt. 1, n. 20, trans. Freddoso, 211. However, when he uses the device of instants of nature in the case of volition, he seems to abandon this view.\n\n$^{8}$^{4} Concordia , disp. 24, n. 6; see Schmutz, 'Du péché de l'ange à la liberté d'indi férence,' f for a much more detailed historical analysis of this point.\n\n## 348\n\nis  related  to  an  earlier  instant  of  nature N1 ,  while  the  elicited  volition  is related to a later part of T, N2.\n\nHowever,  the  two  thinkers'  positions  are  only  super fi cially  identical on  this  score.  The  latter,  considering  the  temporal  instant  as  a  whole, maintains that the present is contingent and sees the order of instants of nature as a logical order that does not constitute a parallel quasi-temporal order. On the other hand, according to Molina, the order of natural priority seems to be a discontinuous and irreversible order. He grants that the will is free at N1 to will A and not to will A .  But once its choice, say A ,  is considered as elicited from the point of view of N2 ,  the  power to refrain from A is  destroyed,  and  it  becomes  necessary  that S wills A . $^{8}$^{6} It  could thus be seen as a more fundamental quasi-time order. Therefore, Molina is better seen as downplaying the Aristotelian thesis of the necessity of the present, rather than rejecting it outright, as Scotus does.\n\n## VIII\n\nThe idea of God's general concurrence with created secondary causes is another aspect of Scotus's in fl uence on Molina's thought. $^{8}$^{7} Scotus's conception is an alternative to that of Thomas Aquinas, according to whom creatures act as secondary causes only by participation to God's causation. On the contrary, as we have seen earlier, Scotus conceives their respective contribution on the model of concurring partial causes producing a total e fect. The central tenet of this new paradigm is that God does not act f on the  secondary cause to produce the e fect, but God cooperates f with the created  cause  in  order  to  produce  a  single,  uni fi ed  e fect.  Molina  sides f with Scotus against the Thomistic account. He objects to the latter that it is based on the mistaken idea that creatures' causal powers are essentially incomplete and thus need a kind of motio from their fi rst cause. However, this  would  ruin  the  very  possibility  of  distinguishing  a  causal  power,  be it  natural  or  free,  from  a  mere  requisite.  What  distinguishes  the  former is  that  they  are  complete.  Therefore,  God  is  a  partial,  concurring  cause, along with the created cause. He is absolutely necessary in the sense that\n\n$^{8}$^{6} Concordia disp. 24, n. 5, 9, and 11.\n\n$^{8}$^{7} Concordia disp.  25-28 and the 1572 Quaestio de concursu generali in Geschichte des Molinismus. Bd. I. Neue Molinaschriften , ed. F. Stegmüller (Munster: 1935). More on this in J. Schmutz, 'La doctrine médiévale des causes et la théologie de la nature pure (XIII -XVI e e siècles),' Revue  thomiste 1-2  (2001):  217-64.  In  the Concordia disp.  35,  Antwerpen,  1595, 146b, Molina explicitly refers to Scotus, Ordinatio IV, d. 1, q. 1 000.\n\nno e fect could occur without his causal contribution. However, he does f not determine by himself the nature of the e fect. Rather, God's causation f is  more  like  a  general  power,  which  is  determined  when  it  is  conjoined with a secondary cause's causation. $^{8}$^{8} This is the reason why God's concurrence is characterized as 'indi ferent.' f $^{8}$^{9} Thus not only does Molina give up  the  Thomistic  model  of  the  structure  of  action,  he  also  presents  an altogether di ferent account of its modality. This is particularly important f in the case of created free causes: given God's concurrence with agent S , it  is  both  possible  for S to  will A and  to  refrain  from  willing A .  In  other words, Molina includes God's concurrence among the requisites relative to which the will is indi ferent. f\n\nWhat  is  remarkable  is  that,  while  the  theory  has  clear  antecedents within Scotus, Molina uses it in order to argue against another central Scotist  thesis,  namely that God's will is the root of contingency. He devotes the whole of disputation 35 and part of disputation 47 to refute this last claim. He rehearses Scotus's threefold argumentation, from the transitivity of causal necessity; from the primacy of the fi rst cause with respect to the  created  e fect;  and  from  on  the  causal  su f ffi ciency  of  the fi rst  cause. Molina  claims  that  all  these  arguments  are  unconvincing.  The  last  two entail that God is the only contingent cause, and therefore lead to theological  determinism. The fi rst  argument is incompatible with the theory of concursus  indi ferens f ,  which  has  two  consequences.  First,  under  the impossible assumption that God were acting as a necessary (i.e. natural) agent, there would nevertheless remain contingency within the world. $^{9}$^{0} The reason is simple according to Molina: since the e fect cannot occur f if  one  of  its  partial  causes  does  not  produce  part  of  its  work,  then,  even if  one  cause  acts  necessarily,  the  e fect  would  not  occur if  the  other  did f not  act.  The  theory  of  general  concurrence  neutralizes  so  to  speak  the modality of God's action. Conversely, if God were acting as a free agent, but there were no other, created free agents, then, under the supposition\n\n$^{8}$^{8} See A.J. Freddoso 'Introduction,' in Luis de Molina, On Divine Foreknowledge: Part IV of the Concordia (Ithaca: 1988), 17.\n\n$^{9}$^{0} Concordia , disp. 35, Antwerpen, 1595, 147a: 'esto necesario moveatur, non tamen necessario movere, quando motus quem recipit, neque est tota, neque su ffi ciens causa eius motus, qui ab ipsa emanare debet, sed adhuc ad eum necessaria est, tanquam pars causae libera  cooperation  et  in fl uxus causae ita  motae.  quare  esto  per  impossibile  Deus  necessitate  naturae  in fl ueret  eadem auxilia  gratiae,  quae  reipsa  confert,  maneret  nihilominus libertas in voluntate nostra.'\n\n$^{8}$^{9} Molina, Quaestio de concursu generali , ed.

The theory of general concurrence leads Molina to a position that is super fi cially similar to the position criticized by Scotus, namely that there can be contingency within things even if  the fi rst  cause is necessary. The similarity is super fi cial,  because those criticized by Scotus were mostly determinists, or at least they considered that contingency was a kind of imperfection, deriving from the imperfection of secondary causes. As we have seen, Scotus treats contingency as a mode of being, on a par with necessity, and Molina shares the same point of view. $^{9}$^{5} What separates the two thinkers is their understanding of the role of divine will. For Scotus, it is the ultimate root of any contingency, while  Molina  grants  that  there  are  as  many  quasi-independent  roots  of contingency as there are free causes. He is led to this position by splitting two closely connected Scotist theses, namely, that God's will is the root of contingency, and that God and creature act as essentially ordered cocauses to produce a single e fect. While he develops the latter as one of the f cornerstones of his thought, he thinks that the fi rst is clearly incompatible with it. He is thus led to claim that Scotus is essentially incoherent.\n\n$^{9}$^{1} Concordia , disp. 47, n. 4, see Freddoso 'Introduction,' 20-21.\n\n$^{9}$^{3} Concordia , disp. 47, n. 2; notice that, as remarked by Freddoso at note 19 on p. 94 of his translation, the causal necessity of the occurring of any event presupposes as a condition  that  God  does  not  miraculously suspend his general concurrence; see also disp. 47, n. 12.\n\n$^{9}$^{2} Concordia , disp. 47, n. 9.\n\n$^{9}$^{4} Concordia , disp. 47, n. 10.\n\n$^{9}$^{5} Scotus, Ord . I, d. 39, n.35, Vat. VI, 444: 'contingentia est modus positivus entis (sicut necessitas  est  alius  modus) . . . immo  contingentia  per  prius  est  a  causa  prima  quam secunda.' Cf. Ibid., n. 13, Vat. VI, 414-15.\n\nThe treatment of Aquinas's theory of God's foreknowledge of future contingents as based on their presence to God in eternity is indeed another instance of Molina's complex relationship to Scotus. On the one hand, he defends the coherence of the idea of successive events coexisting in eternity and so he seems to counter Scotus's own arguments against Aquinas, which are rehearsed at the beginning of disputation 48. Signi fi cantly, he accuses Scotus of overlooking the fact that the present tense locution ' E coexists  with  Eternity'  may  connote  either  the  now  of  time  or  the  now of  eternity. $^{9}$^{6} Thus  when  Scotus  claims  that  coexistence  cannot  relate events occurring at successive moments of time T and T' ,  he  thinks that ' E coexists at T with E *'  expresses  Aquinas's  thesis.  But  this  sentence  is plainly false, and ' E coexist in eternity with E *' is the correct expression of  Aquinas's  thesis.  Thus  it  might  seem  that  Molina  opposes  Scotus  on this score.\n\nAnother argument is directly inherited from Scotus: if the presence of things  in  divine  eternity  were  su ffi cient  to  ground  foreknowledge,  then the angels too should be conceded foreknowledge. Molina considers the traditional answer given by the Thomists, namely that, though the aevum is  an  indivisible  duration  measuring  the  existence  of  the  angelic  substances,  their  operations,  in  particular,  the  acts  of  cognition,  are  not  so indivisible,  but  rather  successive.  But  as  a  rejoinder,  Molina  claims  that it  is  possible  that  God conserves a single act of angelic cognition, which would be indivisible and would embrace all events.\n\nHowever, Molina is much closer to the Subtle Doctor's conception of time  and  eternity  than  it  might  seem.  First  of  all,  he  rejects  Aquinas's theory as a su ffi cient explanation of God's foreknowledge. His objections re fl ect the same conceptions as those underpinning Scotus's own objections. A fi rst argument establishes that the presence of things in eternity cannot  account  for  God's  knowledge  before  his  decision  to  create  the world, for either such knowledge is based on God's knowledge of his own intentions, or things would exist in eternity independently of God's decisions which would preclude the exercise of any providence. $^{9}$^{7}\n\nNonetheless,  the  most  interesting  argument  starts  from  the  idea  that future  events  are  still  contingent,  and  so  are  really  able  not  to  occur.\n\n$^{9}$^{6} Concordia , disp. 48, n. 8-9.\n\n$^{9}$^{7} Concordia , disp. 49, n. 15; De scientia Dei , ed. Stegmüller, 227-28.\n\n352\n\nSuppose  that  some  such  event  does  not  occur,  this  implies  that  it  is able  not  to  exist  in  eternity.  It  acquires  a  de fi nite  existence  only  from the  moment  of  its  occurrence.  But  then  it  would  be  wrong  to  say  that God has had an infallible knowledge of this event at any time before this moment. Using the parallel with God's immensity, Molina claims that just as God's immensity does not coexist with nonexistent places, neither does his  eternity  coexist  with  not  yet  existing  moments.  In  Molina's  technical  vocabulary,  adequate eternity corresponds to the whole of time, but this correspondence is not completed until the whole of time has elapsed. When eternity  is  considered  as  corresponding  to  a  stretch  of  time,  it  is taken inadequately and as such, it does not coexist with what follows. $^{9}$^{8} To  illustrate  this,  he  uses  Scotus's  example  of  a  circle  in  the  process  of being drawn. The center corresponds only to the points of the circumference  that  have  been  actually  traced,  but  not  the  ones  that  are  not  yet drawn. This entails a dynamical conception of time, and a notion of eternity  closer  everlastingness  than  to  strict  atemporal  duration. $^{9}$^{9} On  the whole, it appears that Molina's and Scotus's views on the nature of time and eternity di fer only verbally. f\n\nX\n\nThe debate actually bears on a di ferent issue, namely the relation between f time and modality. As was shown above, Scotus does not subscribe to the Aristotelian  notion  of  the  necessity  of  the  present.  Nevertheless,  he  still holds that there is no power over the past. This leads him to a position on foreknowledge that bears striking similarities with the account known as Ockhamism in the foreknowledge debate. Very brie fl y,  according to this view, the fact that God foreknows that S will do A is  compatible with S 's power not to do A . If S actualizes this power and refrains from doing A at T , then he brings it about that God will have foreknown from all eternity that S does  not  do A at T .  On  the  traditional  Ockhamist  account,  God's foreknowledge is indeed a fected with pastness, but escapes its accidental f necessity by not being a fact really about the past (what recent commentators have labeled a 'hard fact'), since its content depends on what is yet\n\n$^{9}$^{8} De  scientia  Dei ,  ed.  Stegmüller,  228-29  especially  'nondum  adsit  tempus  futurum quod illi correspondeat.'\n\n$^{9}$^{9} See  ibid.  Craig  ( The  Problem  of  Divine  Foreknowledge , 172)  holds  to  the  same conclusion.\n\nfuture  and  thus  contingent. $^{1}$^{0}$^{0} The  Ockhamist  thus  holds  the  following claim:\n\n- (2) God has always known that S will do A at T and, until T ( T excluded), S can bring it about that God will always have known that S will not do A . $^{1}$^{0}$^{1}\n\nIf this thesis is combined with an account of knowledge based on divine decrees  and  the  thesis  of  the  necessity  of  the  present,  the  former  claim becomes equivalent to this:\n\n- (2') God decrees that S will do A at T , and, until T  T ( included), S can bring it about that God will always have decreed that S will not do A .\n\nThis latter claim corresponds exactly to Molina's exposition of the theory of concomitant decrees:\n\nfor they maintain that if, for instance, Peter, who let us assume, is going to sin at some moment of time, did not sin at that time (which he is capable of because of his freedom) then God would bring it about that He had never known that Peter was going to sin, but that instead He had always known from eternity that Peter was not going to sin ( Concordia , disp. 51, n. 1).\n\nMolina  objects  to  this  theory  on  the  ground  that  it  compromises  God's providence  and  predestination  and  entails  the  impossibility  of  genuine prophecies. $^{1}$^{0}$^{2} But  his  main  charge  is  that  any  version  of  the  theory  of concomitant  decrees  leads  to  a  denial  of  the  necessity  of  the  past,  and forces one to acknowledge some power over the past in God. $^{1}$^{0}$^{3} The latter\n\n$^{1}$^{0}$^{0} Ockham, Ord . I,  d.  38,  q.  un.,  OT  IV,  588:  'quando  talis  propositio  de  praesenti aequivalet  propositioni  de  futuro  vel  dependet  a  veritate  alicuius  futuri,  non  oportet quod propositioni verae de praesenti correspondeat necessaria de praeterito. Et ita est in prop  osito.'\n\n$^{1}$^{0}$^{2} Concordia , disp. 51, n. 19-20.\n\n$^{1}$^{0}$^{1} Ibid., OT IV, 586. Molina expresses the same view in De scientia Dei , ed. Stegmüller, 242: 'si ego pro mea libertate fecero hoc, Deus faciet se numquam scivisse nisi hoc, et si fecero oppositum, ut de facto possum, Deus faciet se numquam scivisse nisi oppositum.' Molina attributes the view to most scholastics and to many important Tridentine theologians, especially to Antonio de Cordoba and Andrés de Vega (see above, n. 000).\n\n$^{1}$^{0}$^{3} The inference from the (restricted) contingency of God's foreknowledge to a generalized  power  over  the  past  was  highlighted  in  the  14th  century  by  thinkers  like  Peter of  Ailly  and  earlier  by  Thomas  Bradwardine;  see  R.M.  Gaskin,  'Peter  of  Ailly  and  Other Fourteenth  Century  Thinkers  on  Divine  Power  and  the  Necessity  of  the  Past,' Archiv für die Geschichte der Philosophie 79 (1997): 273-91.\n\nis strictly impossible and we see that Molina grants a strong necessity to past states of a fairs. Its medieval label is necessity f per accidens :  once an event has occurred, it becomes contradictory to assume that it has not. $^{1}$^{0}$^{4} According to Molina, any theory along the lines of 2 or 2' entails the contingency of what is past. Suppose for instance that God decrees today that the world never existed: this would have the consequence that some past events did not occur, which is absurd. $^{1}$^{0}$^{5} This criticism of Ockhamism can be extended to the Scotist, eternalist, version of the theory of concomitant decrees. Even if one grants that God's present volitions never fade into the past,  and  therefore  remain  contingent,  they  nonetheless  have  real,  temporally  past  e fects. f $^{1}$^{0}$^{6} As  a  consequence,  while  on  the  one  hand  divine decrees  are  contingent  if  they  are  related  to  eternity  taken  as  a  whole, on the other hand they are accidentally necessary if they are referred to some portion of time. Once God's decision to create the world is actual, it becomes necessary at all later times that God has decided to create the world. $^{1}$^{0}$^{7} What emerges from this is that Molina is close to the Aristotelian picture of the relations of time and modality and distances himself from the consequences of the Scotist conception.\n\nThis becomes a highly disputed issue when one turns to the Molinist treatment  of  the  logical  problem  of  future  contingents.  Interpreters  are opposed on the question of whether Molina endorses or denies the Principle of Bivalence (PB) in the case of future contingent propositions. The fatalist  inference  discussed  by  Aristotle  in De  interpretatione ,  Chapter  9 (18a34-b25) starts from the premise that PB applies to all future contingent  propositions,  and  concludes  to  the  necessity  of  what  will  happen. One way of interpreting the argument is to see it as resting on the idea that if  some proposition is true, then there is a fact that corresponds to it, and facts are such that they are unpreventable. In the case of the past, we think  that  is  stocked  with  truths  and  this  is  the  reason  we  come  to believe that it is unpreventable or necessary. On the traditional interpretation, Aristotle would not deny the principle on which the fatalist inference  is  based,  but  instead  restrict  the  scope  of  PB.  The  fatalist  and  the Aristotelian share the idea that there is a strict match between truth (or\n\n$^{1}$^{0}$^{4} Concordia , disp. 51, n. 12 and Commentaria in primam D. Thomae partem , q. 25, a. 4, 354a-355b. See Craig, The Problem of Divine Foreknowledge , 186-87.\n\n$^{1}$^{0}$^{6} Molina's criticism anticipates C. Normore's remark that 'if what is genuinely past is what is past for us, this raises the very delicate issue of wether what is in our past is really necessary or not' ('Duns Scotus's Modal Theory,' 136).\n\n$^{1}$^{0}$^{5} Concordia , disp. 51, n. 14.\n\n$^{1}$^{0}$^{7} Concordia , disp. 51, n. 25; disp. 48, n. 21; De scientia Dei , ed. Stegmüller, 244-45.\n\nontological determinateness) and necessity. And Molina seems to accept the  same  conclusion. $^{1}$^{0}$^{8} But  Scotus's  conception  of  synchronic  contingency and God's will as a truth-maker for contingent propositions, at least as far as propositions on the present are considered, entails a possible gap between the two. $^{1}$^{0}$^{9} Conversely, Molina's criticisms of the theory of concomitant decrees seem to rest on a fundamentally Aristotelian intuition.\n\nWe have seen above that Molina ascribes deterministic consequences to Scotus's theory of the source of contingency. He comes to same conclusion as far as the latter's account of divine foreknowledge is considered. Scotus's position is summarized in the following way:\n\nhe claims that it is solely in the determination of His will that God knows which part of each contradiction is going to turn out to be contingently true in the future, and thus that it is solely in the free determination of His will that  He  knows  future  contingents  with  certainty  ( Concordia disp.  50,  n.  7, trans. Freddoso, 132).\n\nSuch a theory is  incompatible  with  libertarian  free  will. $^{1}$^{1}$^{0} Suppose  that S is  free  to  will A .  Then  it  must  be  able  to  refrain  from  willing A .  God decides to make ' S wills A ' true by bringing about the corresponding state of  a fairs.  But  this  seems  to  entail  that  either f S is  no  longer  able  not  to will A ,  or God's will would not su ffi ce to ground an infallible knowledge.\n\n$^{1}$^{0}$^{8} Concordia , disp. 52, n. 6, n. 15 and n. 37; Quaestio de futuris contingentibus, ed. Stegmüller, 9: 'si enuntiationes de futuro essent determinate verae, omnia evenirent necessario non solum necessitate consequentiae sed etiam consequentis.' In this passage, Molina does not reconstruct Aristotle's position but seems to give his responsio propria. Matters are complicated by the exact interpretation of the term 'determinate.' According to Craig ( The Problem of Divine Foreknowledge ) and Freddoso ('Introduction'), it means 'necessarily' and on their reading Molina does not restrict PB, but just tries to detect a fallacy in the fatalist  inference.  However,  it  is  more  likely  that  Molina  understands  'determinately'  as expressing the distribution of truth-values within a disjunction of contradictory sentences; see R.M. Gaskin, 'Molina on Divine Foreknowledge and the Principle of Bivalence,' Journal of the History of Philosophy 32 (1994): 551-71. A given sentence is determinately true if it is true and its contradictory is false. And it is indeterminately true i f it is indeterminately f false.  Such  a  reading  of  the  adverb  'determinate'  was  not  uncommon,  for  someone  like Peter Aureol in the 14th century, who explicitly denies that PB applies to future contingent propositions, simply equates determinate verum and verum . Cf. Scriptum super sententias I dist. 38, art. 3, ed. Schabel, Cahiers de l'institut du Moyen Âge Grec et Latin 65 (1995): 126.\n\n$^{1}$^{1}$^{0} De Scientia Dei , ed. Stegmüller, 238; Concordia , disp. 50, n. 7, n. 14.\n\n$^{1}$^{0}$^{9} For Scotus's hesitant claims about the determinacy of the future, see Lectura I, d. 39, n. 69, Vat. XVII, 502-03: 'sed in futuris non est determinatio talis: licet Deus determinate sciat a fore pro aliquo instanti, pro illo tamen potest scire a non fore'; Ord .  I,  d. 39, n. 26, Vat. VI, 432: 'talis autem non est determinatio ex parte futuri, quia licet alicui intellectui sit una pars vera determinate . . . non tamen ita quin in potestate causae est pro illo instanti ponere oppositum.'\n\nNow,  Molina  makes  up  a  possible,  compatibilist  answer  a  Scotist  could give: although 'God wills that S wills A and S does not will A '  expresses an impossible proposition ( in sensu composito ), yet it is possible in sensu diviso that S does not will A .  Molina is reluctant to countenance the pertinence of the distinction in such a case, because there are two types of conditional necessity of the form 'necessarily (if P ,  then Q ).'  If  the  antecedent P is such that if someone S has the power to bring it about that Q is not true, then S has the power to bring it about that P is not true either, we can consistently maintain both 'it is impossible that P and notQ ' and ' S has the power to make notQ true.' If, however, the truth of the antecedent is beyond the scope of S ,  then it should be denied that S has the power to make notQ true. $^{1}$^{1}$^{1}\n\nIn the Concordia , Molina introduces the theory of a thorough Thomist like Domingo Bañez (1528-1604) as a mere verbal variant of Scotus's own theory. $^{1}$^{1}$^{2} This  gives  him an occasion to discuss a problem which Scotus struggled with, as we saw above, namely, how an account of divine foreknowledge based on divine decrees avoids the pitfall of either making God the author of sin or rendering him uncertain about bad events. $^{1}$^{1}$^{3} Bañez's own answer introduces a clear asymmetry: God knows that S sins  when he refrains from willing that S acts righteously. But as we saw above, Scotus considered that this cannot provide a secure basis for God's infallible knowledge,  unless  one  claims  that  any  free  creature,  if  left  to  her  own resources, will inevitably sin. But this last concession entails the denial of free will and responsibility. The Thomist opponent of Molina is treated as an extreme version of Scotus's account of foreknowledge, which con fi rms that he interpreted the latter as a deterministic theory.\n\n$^{1}$^{1}$^{1} De scientia Dei ,  ed.  Stegmüller, 238; Concordia ,  disp.  50,  n.  9;  Molina's distinction is similar to the Anselmian distinction between necessitas antecedens and necessitas sequens . Cf. Anselm, Cur Deus homo II, 17, Opera omnia ,  ed. F. Schmitt (Stuttgart: 1966), II, 125. See Suarez, De gratia , prol. 2, c. 7, § 20 (1st ed. 1619), Opera omnia , ed. C. Berton (Paris: 1856-77) vol.

Freddoso, 134: 'A certain disciple of St. Thomas, differing only verbally from Scotus, attributes the same position to St. Thomas.' See D. Bañez, Scholastica Commentaria in universam primam partem angelici Doctoris D. Thomae , q.  14, a.  13  (Venice:  1602),  449E:  'Deus  cognoscit  futura  contingentia  per  rationes  ipsorum  que sunt in Doe, idest per ideas proprias, quae sunt in Deo futurorum contingentium, sed idea repraesentat certo et infallibiliter per modum exemplaris et e ffi cientis'; 450C: 'idea quantum  ad  actualem  existentiam  creaturarum  et  quo  ad  alia  praedicata  contingentia,  non repraesentat naturaliter et necessario simpliciter loquendo sed tantum in sensu composito, idest supposita libera divinae, voluntatis determinatione circa ipsos e fectus creatos.' f\n\nMolina's  own  positive  account  of  divine  foreknowledge  constitutes  of course an essential element in order to appraise his relationship to Scotus.  As  this  aspect  of  his  thought  is  treated  elsewhere  in  the  volume,  I will  give  only  a  rough  sketch. $^{1}$^{1}$^{4} Molina's  central  innovation  consists  in the  introduction  of  middle  knowledge  ( scientia  media ) as  an  intermediary  stage  in  the  divisions  proposed  by  Scotus  and  Aquinas.  The  former distinguished God's natural knowledge of what is necessary and his free knowledge of contingent states of a fairs. Middle knowledge falls between f the natural and the free knowledge. Like Scotus, Molina describes God's natural knowledge as the knowledge, based on the contemplation of his own essence, of what is possible. $^{1}$^{1}$^{5} Natural knowledge and free knowledge are characterized exactly as Scotus did: the content of the former includes all  necessary  states  of  a fairs  and  lies  beyond  the  scope  of  God's  power. f God has free knowledge of what he decrees to create. It is free because (i)  it  could  have  a  di ferent  content  and  (ii)  such  a  change  depends  on f God's  will  ( Concordia ,  disp.  52,  n.  9).  Middle  knowledge  is  then  added to  this  dichotomy  in  order  to  save  creaturely  freedom  as  well  as  God's providence and predestination. According to Molina, God knows before any decision, not only what is possible under any hypothesis considered, but  also  what  creatures  would  do  in  any  situations,  in  particular,  what humans would freely do under such or such a hypothesis. $^{1}$^{1}$^{6} Through his middle  knowledge,  then,  God  knows  not  actual  future  contingents,  but what Molina calls conditional future contingents (FCCs):\n\nAll  contingent  states  of  a fairs  are,  I  repeat,  represented  to  God  naturally, f before any act or free determination of the divine will; and they are represented not only as being possible but also as being future-not absolutely future,  but  future  under  the  condition  and  on  the  hypothesis  that  God\n\n$^{1}$^{1}$^{4} Freddoso ('Introduction,'  46-62)  and  Craig  ( The Problem of Divine Foreknowledge , Chapter 7) provide valuable entries in Molina's version of the doctrine. For later developments within Jesuit theology, see S.K. Knebel, 'Scientia Media. Ein Diskursarchäologischer Leitfaden  durch  das  17.  Jahrhundert,' Archiv  für  Begri fsgeschichte f 34  (1991):  262-94.  For an introduction to middle knowledge discussions within contemporary philosophy of religion, see E. Dekker, Middle Knowledge (Leuwen: 2000).\n\n$^{1}$^{1}$^{6} Evidence for the reality of such a knowledge is given by the biblical story of David and Saul at Keilah (1 Sam. 23:10-12), and Jesus's lamentation at Chorazin and Bethsaida (Matt. 11:21).\n\n$^{1}$^{1}$^{5} De scientia Dei , ed. Stegmüller, 239; God's essence is the primary object of his knowledge; see Concordia , disp. 50, n. 16.\n\nshould decide to create this or that order of things and causes, with these or those circumstances ( Concordia , disp. 50, n. 15, trans. Freddoso, 140).\n\nThat is,  God  knows, under various hypothetical antecedents H ,  whether agent S would  freely  do A or  freely  refrain  from  doing A . Then,  if  he decides to create a world containing H ,  he knows that S will do A . $^{1}$^{1}$^{7} For instance, he knows that, if David stayed in Keilah, Saul would besiege the city,  while  there  is  no  incompatibility  between  David  staying  in  Keilah and Saul not besieging it.\n\nNow,  according  to  Scotus,  natural  and  free  knowledge  are  mutually exclusive  and  jointly  exhaustive,  since  the  root  of  contingency  must  be traced back to God's will. Thus the whole charge against the divine ideas account rested  on  the  claim  that  purely  conceptual  connections  escape the  will's  power  and  are  therefore  necessary. $^{1}$^{2}$^{1} Molina  turns  the  Scotist\n\nThe theory's central tenet is that the truth or falsity of any FCC escapes the control of God's will, and in this respect, middle knowledge is akin to natural knowledge: 'before any free determination of His will, by virtue of the depth of His natural knowledge . . . He discerns what the free choice of any creature would do by its own innate freedom' ( Concordia , disp. 49, n. 11, trans.  Freddoso,  119). $^{1}$^{1}$^{8} However,  FCCs  are  contingently  true,  because their truth depends on what creatures would freely do. $^{1}$^{1}$^{9} The content of middle  knowledge  is  such  that  though  it  escapes  God's  power  it  is  not essentially  so,  and  in  this  respect,  it  shares  common  features  with  free knowledge. $^{1}$^{2}$^{0}\n\n$^{1}$^{1}$^{7} Freddoso  uses  the  device  of  Creation  situations  in  his  presentation  of  Molinism. Intuitively,  the  idea  is  that  God  cannot  create  any  possible  worlds  he  pleases,  but  only those that are part of a Creation situation. As he writes ('Introduction,' 49): 'if God knows prevolitionally in CS w ( ) that Adam will sin if placed in H ,  then He cannot arrange things in such a way that Adam will be in H and yet not sin . . . Over this fact God has no control.' Of course, God may decide to create a world with a di ferent condition in which Adam f would not sin, but that would constitute another Creation situation.\n\n$^{1}$^{1}$^{9} Concordia , disp.  50,  n.  15,  Freddoso,  140-41;  disp.  52,  n.  9; De  scientia  Dei , ed. Stegmüller, 240.\n\n$^{1}$^{1}$^{8} Concordia , disp. 52, n. 10, trans. Freddoso, 168: 'such knowledge should in no way be called free, because it is prior to any act of God's will and also because it wat not within God's power to know through this type of knowledge anything other than what He in fact knew'; n. 12: '[God] knows through it middle knowledge, not freely, but quasi-naturally.'\n\n$^{1}$^{2}$^{0} Concordia ,  disp.  52,  n.  10,  Freddoso,  169:  'therefore  it  is  no  more  natural  for  God to know through this sort of knowledge one part of a contradiction than it is for Him to know the opposite part.'\n\n$^{1}$^{2}$^{1} In  addition to the references above, see the following passage: 'nullum subiectum continet nisi veritates necessarias de ipso, quia ad contingentes de ipso aequaliter se habet ex se et ad opposita' (Scotus, Ord . Prol. q. un., p. 3, n. 169, Vat. I, 112-13).\n\nargument on its back. Since the theory that God's will is the root of contingency  destroys  human  freedom,  the  only  way  to  save  the  latter  is  to claim that knowledge of what free creatures would do in various circumstances is prior to any actual decision on God's part. This, in turn, entails the  denial  of  the  Scotist  claim  that  the  extent  of  God's  will  settles  the limits of what is contingent. $^{1}$^{2}$^{2}\n\nThere are two further points within the theory of scientia  media that need some discussion. First, the theory requires a substantial use of the notion of possible worlds. As we have seen above, although there are elements in Scotus's thought which invite to ascribe him a possible worlds modal framework, nevertheless total states of a fairs or combinations of f unactualized possibilities into uni fi ed worlds do not have a speci fi c role, in part because the notion of compossibility alone does not provide enough resources to  de fi ne a whole possible world. But the main reason is that every contingently uni fi ed ordo rerum is a possible object for God's choice. Thus if it is  possible that the past history of the actual world be exactly as it is now, call it h , and some state of a fairs f s contingently obtains now, then the combination h &amp; not-s is another possible object of God's choice. But then it is indi ferent to say either that God actualizes a collection of f compossible states of a fairs or that he actualizes a complete f ordo rerum . Talk  of  possible  worlds  is  inessential  within  Scotus's  modal  framework. But things change once we say that some FCCs are true independently of God's  choice.  In  Molina,  expressions  like ordo, series  rerum, combinatio , or even mundus are not occasionally mentioned, but systematically used in order to describe complete sets of circumstances that are the object of divine choice. The following passage is especially striking:\n\nGod in  His  eternity  before  the  free  determination  of  His  will  to  create  or produce something, from the intuition of His essence and power, knew by a natural knowledge everything He could do, that He could create this world,\n\n$^{1}$^{2}$^{2} Concordia ,  disp.  50,  n.  15,  trans.  Freddoso,  140:  'and  so  we  disagree  with  Scotus, because  we  hold  that  the  explanation  for  God's  knowing  with  certainty  which  part  of any  contradiction  among  those  contingent  states  of  a fairs . . . is  going  to  obtain  it  not  a f determination of the divine will . . .' Molina's charge in disp. 53 against those who try to account for God's knowledge of FCC through his conditional decrees can be applied to the similar move a Scotist could do. The 17th-century Scotist, Bartolomeo Mastri (also known as Princeps scotistarum), advanced such a view of God's knowing FCCs through his actual decree that if it were that H ,  then S would do A .  Cf. Disputationes theologicae in I librum Sententiarum (Venice: 1684), d. 3, q. 4, a. 4, n. 256; 193b. For Mastri's overall position on the issues discussed here, see J.-P. Anfray, 'Prescience divine, décrets concomitants et liberté humaine d'après Bartholomeo Mastri,' in Saggi sul pensiero fi loso fi co di Bartolomeo Mastri (1602-1673) , ed. M. Forlivesi (Padova: 2006), 555-92.\n\n360\n\n## jean pascal anfray -\n\nand in fi nitely many others that he could create this one in this or that part of  time  or  any  other,  that  He  could  create  in  it  these  angels,  or  in fi nitely many others . . . that He could grant to each single man such or such a complexion, or not this one but another; and so on for the in fi nitely many other orders and combinations of things and circumstances that His omnipotence could do in this universe.\n\nOne should know in addition, that [God] in His eternity and before the determination of His will, by the same natural knowledge stemming from the absolute comprehension and penetration of the things and causes, saw what would be future if He chose to produce this or that order, what any angel, left  to  his  own  free  will,  would  do  by  his  innate  freedom  with  such and such helps and, given these or those occasions and circumstances, what any man . . . would do by his innate freedom, while he could nonetheless do the contrary if he willed so, and under the same set of circumstances, temptations and occasions ( De scientia Dei , Stegmüller, 239).\n\nIn the fi rst paragraph, Molina describes possible worlds as alternatives to God's choice. But the second paragraph shows that even if, for instance, a  world  where  Peter  does  not  deny  Christ  is  a  possible  world,  it  is  not an  object  for  God's  choice,  which  is  restrained  by  what  Peter  would  do under such circumstances. The truth of FCCs (of what some call conditionals of freedom) constitutes a barrier beyond which God's power does not extend. By giving such a prominence to the truth of FCCs over possible worlds, Molina might seem to downplay the idea of a possible world. But this is not so. If some state of a fairs f s depends on what a free creature would do, then God would no longer have a choice between actualizing  world w where h  &amp;  s obtain  and  actualizing  world w' where h  &amp; not-s obtain. Suppose it is true that if it were that h , then it would be that s ,  then  supposing  that  God  wants h to  obtain,  he  must  actualize s .  And since God acts according to an overall providential plan, if he wants some combination of circumstances to obtain, he must actualize all the FCCs that follow from them. This collection describes a unique set of states of a fairs,  and  makes  up  a  single  possible  world.  This  is  especially  imporf tant  to  account  for  the  realization  of  God's  providential  project.  Scotus sees it  as  a  sequential  process,  including  many distinct decrees, ordered according  to instantia  naturae :  thus fi rst  God  wills  the  principal  goal  of creation, namely the Incarnation of his son, and then he predestines some to glory, and fi nally he permits Adam's sin. $^{1}$^{2}$^{3} On the contrary, according to Molina, God knows what would happen in each ordo rerum considered as  a  complete  history  of  the  world  and  makes  a  single  uni fi ed  creation\n\n$^{1}$^{2}$^{3} Scotus, Ordinatio III, d. 7, q. 3, passim, in particular n. 67, Vat. IX, 288-89.\n\ndecree rationally grounded on his scientia media . $^{1}$^{2}$^{4} The end is therefore not  speci fi ed  independently  from  the  means  to  attain  it,  which  entails that, had Adam not sinned, God would not have incarnated himself.\n\nSecond,  from  an  epistemological  point  of  view,  Molina's  account  of middle  knowledge  can  be  seen  as  a  revised  version  of  the  divine  ideas account, as is con fi rmed by his explanation of the medium of God's middle knowledge:\n\nThus with Molina, the notions of asking what would happen in a given world, and thereby of truth in a world, become central. And thus far, the theory  of  middle  knowledge  is  an  important  step  between  the  Scotist notion of a possible logicum and the modern notion of a possible world. $^{1}$^{2}$^{5}\n\nIt  is  absolutely  true  that  the  ideas  (or  the  divine  essence  known  as  the primary object) are the fi rm and certain explanation for the fact that God, who comprehends in the deepest way both Himself and the things that He contains  eminently,  knows  future  contingents  ( Concordia ,  disp.  50,  n.  16, trans. Freddoso, 142).\n\nMolina grants that ideas are not su ffi cient to ground God's foreknowledge of actual future contingents, since a divine decree must be added. Nonetheless, ideas as intellectual representations prior to God's decrees are an appropriate characterization of the object of middle knowledge. $^{1}$^{2}$^{6} Such ideas  are  not  distinct  from  God's  essence,  because  following  orthodoxy, Molina claims that God's knowledge is not taken from things. $^{1}$^{2}$^{7} He  disagrees with those who ascribe to Scotus the idea that God knows things in their objective being understood as a divine production in an esse deminutum .  On  the  contrary,  he  rightly  ascribes  to  Scotus  the  view  that  God's essence  is  the  primary  object  of  his  cognition. $^{1}$^{2}$^{8} However,  he  departs\n\n$^{1}$^{2}$^{4} Commentaria , q. 23, a. 4-5, disp. 1, memb. 7, 313a: 'at ita, propter plenissimam deliberationem,  cognitionemve,  qua  futura  omnia,  ex  hypothesi  praevidebat,  meditandus  est elegisse simul totum ordinem illum.'\n\n$^{1}$^{2}$^{6} Concordia , disp. 50, n. 17-20.\n\n$^{1}$^{2}$^{5} See T.

Thomae partem ,  q.  14,  a.  5  and  6,  disp.  un  (Lyon: 1622), 154a.:  '[intellectus  divinus]  primo  fertur  in  suam  essentiam,  ut  in  obiectum  primarium, in  quo  virtute  continentur  naturae  aliarum  rerum,  et  mediante  essentia  ita  cognita  illo eodem intuitu cognoscit ac intuetur ulterius, ut obiectum secundarium, naturam cuiusque aliarum rerum propriam.'\n\n$^{1}$^{2}$^{8} Commentaria , ibid., 155a.\n\n362\n\nfrom Scotus and aligns with Aquinas, by claiming that ideas as such are not to be identi fi ed with the essences or natures of things, but are identical  with  God's  essence. $^{1}$^{2}$^{9} Molina  justi fi es  this  by  appeal  to  the  further claim  that  the  creatures'  essences  are  not  possible  through  themselves, but owe their possibility to God's power. $^{1}$^{3}$^{0} And this is clearly in opposition to the standard interpretation of Scotus. Moreover, the identi fi cation of  ideas  with  God's  essence  is  closely  connected  to  another  speci fi cally Molinist  claim,  namely  that  God's  knowledge  is  more  perfect  than  its objects,  or  more  precisely,  that,  in  virtue  of  God's  in fi nite  superiority  to the  known  objects,  something  can  be  epistemically  determinate  within God, in other words, God can be certain about it, even if it is metaphysically indeterminate. This property of God's knowledge is what Molina calls supercomprehensio . $^{1}$^{3}$^{1} Without  entering  into  the  intricacies  of  this  doctrine, what is clear is that it is close in spirit to the Neoplatonic thesis that what  is  known  has  the  character  of  the  knower,  so  that  a  most  perfect being can know what is indeterminate in itself. $^{1}$^{3}$^{2} Such an idea somehow comes to the surface in Thomas Aquinas's treatment of God's foreknowledge, when he claims that a thing's mode of being is not necessarily the same as its esse cognitum .  It  entails  that  knowledge with respect to God\n\n$^{1}$^{2}$^{9} Commentaria , q.  15,  a.  1,  disp.  2,  242a:  'comparatione  intellectus  divini  essentia divina propriissime habet rationem ideae creaturarum, et non ipsae naturae rerum. Haec est contra Scotum, Durandum, et reliquos . . .'\n\n$^{1}$^{3}$^{1} The fullest  account  of  the  doctrine  is  to  be  found  in Concordia ,  disp.  52,  n.  11-18. Molina says at n. 11 that 'in order to see which part a free being will turn itself toward . . . what is required is an absolutely profound and absolutely pre-eminent comprehension, such as is  found  only  in  God  with  respect  to  creatures.'  The  chiasm  between  an  object's  intrinsic knowability (its metaphysical determinateness) and the possibility that some in fi nite being be able to know it is clearly a ffi rmed ibid., n. 17: '[that] things that are knowable in the object by their very nature or because of their being, but it is not true of those things that are known in a way exceeding their nature solely because of the eminence and unlimited perfection of the knower.' Cf. Commentaria , q. 16, disp. 1, 246b: 'quia Deus non sumit talem cognitionem suam nec certitudinem illius a rebus ipsis contingenter futuris, quae in utramque partem possunt evenire, sed ex altissima comprehensione rerum ominum in sua essentia, ut in primario obiecto, atque ex in fi nita, omnique ex parte illimitata perfectione sui intellectus eam habet, inde est quo mensura veritatis illius scientiae nulla ratione sit obiectum secundarium, hoc est, essentia divina una cum libera determinatione voluntatis divinae.'  On  this,  see  Freddoso  'Introduction,'  50-53;  Craig, The Problem of Divine Foreknowledge , 179-83.\n\n$^{1}$^{3}$^{0} Commentaria , ibid.: 'exemplar igitur primum, in quo a Deo fi eri posse conspicitur . . . non est ipsamet natura humana habens rationem entis, sed essentia divina, in qua virtute continetur, et cuius potest esse participatio, eam suo modo imitando.'\n\n$^{1}$^{3}$^{2} See  in  particular  Boethius, Consolatio  philosophiae ,  V,  pr.  4,  l.  75-77,  000:  'omne enim  quod  cognoscitur  non  secundum  sui  vim,  sed  secundum  cognoscentium  potius compre  henditur  facultatem.'  To  characterize  this,  Hoenen  1993  (172)  contrasts  such  an epistemo  logical subjectivism with epistemological objectivism.\n\nand to creatures is at most an analogical concept, and in so far, Molina seems  to  share  Aquinas's  conception  of  the  divine  attributes. $^{1}$^{3}$^{3} And  in turn, this is clearly at odds with Scotus's metaphysics and rational theology,  the  starting  point  of  which  lies  in  the  univocity  of  the  concept  of being, of its attributes, and of other perfections. $^{1}$^{3}$^{4}\n\nXII\n\nWhat emerges from this study is that it is almost impossible to give a onesided appraisal of Molina's relation to Scotus. Both thinkers have a strong notion of metaphysical freedom, but they do not articulate it with exactly the  same  metaphysical  hindsight.  The  discussions  around  the  relation of  time  and  modality  and  about  the  grounds  of  knowledge  have  shown that  Molina  is  sometimes  closer  to  ancient  modal  and  cognitive  paradigms than it might have seemed at fi rst glance. However, no account of foreknowledge provides a prima facie so complete reconciliation of God's foreknowledge  with  a  libertarian  view  of  free  will  than  the  doctrine  of middle knowledge. And so, to close this study, we should ask if it is possible to cast some light on Scotus's theory through the lens of Molinism. As  we  saw  above,  some  passages  in  the  Subtle  Doctor  lend  themselves almost  naturally  to  a  quasi-Molinist  reading.  Thus,  in Ord .  II,  d.  34-37, Scotus seems to claim that there is a kind of dependency, more precisely a counterfactual dependency between a creature's free decision and God's decreeing its occurrence, such that, if  the creature had willed di ferently, f so  would  have  God.  Until  now,  this  dependency  has  been  understood along Ockhamist lines. But there might also be a Molinist interpretation if one adds that God knows what a creature would do before (in our way of conceiving) decreeing anything. And so, as Molina himself remarks in at least one place, Scotus's theory, if considered as incomplete, is not incompatible with the Molinist account:\n\nIf  therefore,  Scotus,  when  he  says  that  God  foreknows  future  contingents in the determination of His free will, conceives according to the sense that\n\n$^{1}$^{3}$^{3} See ST I,  q.  14,  a.  6,  ad.  1;  a.  13,  ad.  2.  On  the  analogy  of  divine  attributes,  see ST I, q. 13. See L.J. Elders, The Philosophical Theology of S. Thomas Aquinas (Leiden et al.: 1990). $^{1}$^{3}$^{4} Scotus, Ord .  I,  d.  3,  p.  1,  q.  1-2,  n.  26-55,  Vat.  III,  18-38.  On  the  univocity  of  the concept of being, see the studies in Part IV of Honnefelder et al., John Duns Scotus: Metaphysics  and  Ethics .  In  the  particular  case  of  divine  perfections  like  intelligence  or  will, Scotus claims that in fi nity does not destroy the formal nature of that to which it is added ( Ord . I, d. 8, q. 4, n. 17).\n\n364\n\n## jean pascal anfray -\n\nhas been explained, and that, assuming this natural knowledge by which He eternally  knew  all  future  contingents  in  their  future  being,  not  absolutely but  conditionally  such;  and  if  by  the  free  determination  of  His  will  [God] decided  to  create  this  or  that  order  of  things  with  these  or  those  circumstances, then what he says is true and agrees with ourselves ( De scientia Dei , Stegmüller, 240).\n\nMolina acknowledges that Scotus could be read as claiming that divine decrees provide a su ffi cient ground for God's knowing what will (unconditionally) exist, but that such a free knowledge is preceded by God's knowledge  of  FCC.  This  reading  was  not  uncommon  during  the  17th  century among Scotists. $^{1}$^{3}$^{5} And among recent scholars, those who hold a libertarian interpretation of his teaching on free will are led to ascribe a similar position to Scotus. In other words, in order to fi ll  the gap between God's knowledge  as  based  on  his  decrees  and  the  counterfactual  dependence of his decrees upon what a free creature would do under such and such circumstances, one would have to add something like middle knowledge to  Scotus's  account. $^{1}$^{3}$^{6} In  this  respect,  Molina's  innovations  can  help  to shed new light on the Subtle Doctor's thought.\n\n$^{1}$^{3}$^{5} Especially  important  'Molinist  Scotists'  are  John  Punch  and  Filippo  Fabri.  Cf. Filipppo  Fabri, Disputationes  theologicae (Venice:  1619),  I,  dist.  39,  dispute  53,  n.  22-23, 325b: '. . . contingentia provenire et a voluntate divina, et simul etiam a voluntate creata, quae est causa proxima . . .'; op. cit., disp. 54, n. 42, 337a: 'Molina et alii sentiunt ergo in re cum Scoto'; ibid., n. 50, 338b: 'ad salvandum libertatem nostrae voluntatis, et contingentiam in rebus su ffi cit quod decretum illud divinae voluntatis sequatur praevisionem, quid sit volitura mea voluntas.'\n\n$^{1}$^{3}$^{6} This  is  approximately  the  conclusion  reached  by  Dekker.  See  'Does  Scotus  Need Molina?' 109-10. In the end, however, he thinks that the theory of middle knowledge as a name for the process of God's cognition does not lead further than Scotus's own account in terms of decrees. The theory of middle knowledge only gives a fi ner explanation of the way of reconciling God's foreknowledge and created free will.",

The  Subtle  Doctor's  concepts  and  doctrines  set  the  shape  of  much  of the  discussions  of  the  time,  on  the  nature  and  subject  of  metaphysics, on the freedom of the will, and on the principles of morality. More precisely, Scotus's de fi nition of being qua being as that to which being is not repugnant ( cui non repugnat esse ),  and as a possible being, left a twofold $^{1} legacy to later philosophy: on the one hand, his conception of metaphysics  as  a  transcendental science of the univocal concept of being, and on the other hand the centrality of the notion of freedom, whose fi rst manifestation  is  the  contingency  of  the  world  order.  During  the  Renaissance and  early  modern  period,  those  who  would  qualify  as  Scotists  were  so many that the Cistercian Juán Caramuel Lobkowitz could claim that Scoti schola numerosior est aliis simul sumptis (the school of Scotus counts more than all the other schools taken together).  Not only was the institutional $^{2} authority of Scotus uncontroversial but his thought also exercised a more di fused  in f fl uence.  Jesuit  philosophy  and  theology  was  undoubtedly  the main channel of di fusion for Scotus's  thought  in  the  early  modern  era, f and this, despite the fact that the ratio studiorum of  the  order (1586-99) made  the  study  of  Thomas  Aquinas's  doctrine  the  basis  of  their  theological teaching.  Especially well known is the importance of the Scotist $^{3}\n\n$^{1} See  John  Duns  Scotus, Quodl .  q.  3,  n.  2,  ed.  L.  Wadding  (Lyon:  1639),  XII,  67;  trans. F. Alluntis and A. Wolter, God and Creatures: The Quodlibetal Questions (Princeton: 1975), 61.  Honnefelder, Duns  Scotus (Munich:  2005)  clearly  states  the  twofold  motivation  that underlies Scotus's thought. On Scotus's metaphysics, see L. Honnefelder, Scientia transcendens: Die formale Bestimmtheit der Seiendheit und Realität in der Metaphysik des Mittelalters und der Neuzeit (Duns Scotus, Suárez, Wol f, Kant, Peirce) f (Hamburg: 1990).\n\n$^{3} For a historical justi fi cation of this claim, see J.

He is admittedly one of 'Scotus's intellectual descendants.'  However, the impact of Scotus on the latter is more $^{5} limited in scope and more problematic than with some of his famous fellow Jesuits, like Suárez and Gabriel Vázquez (1549-1604). Indeed, Molina's intellectual production (at least in its extant state) ranges over fewer topics than that of the Doctor eximius .  In particular, the nature of the object of  metaphysics and the discussion of eternal truths and divine ideas do not fi gure among Molina's chief preoccupations. In contrast to this, and somewhat unsurprisingly in the context of post-Tridentine theology, the discussion of the nature of free will and its reconciliation with God's foreknowledge, providence, and predestination is where Scotus's in fl uence on Molina proves most important.  The controversies $^{6} de auxiliis that  arose in reaction to Molina's teachings on grace and predestination in the Concordia provide  evidence  of  an  (at  least  tactical)  proximity  between  the Jesuits and the Franciscans against the Dominicans.  There are thus his$^{7} torical a ffi nities between o ffi cial Scotists and Molinists. But in this chapter  I  will  try  to  give  a  philosophical  assessment  of  the  relation  between Scotus  and  Molina.  Here,  the  notion  of  in fl uence should be understood\n\n$^{4} See  Honnefelder, Scientia  transcendens .  Scotus's  account  of  broadly  logical  modality  (possible  logicum)  constitutes  the  background  of  all  17th-century  discussion  about the divine foundation of modality and the source of eternal truths and about the nature of  possible  beings.  See  T.  Ho fmann,  Creatura  intellecta: f Die  Ideen  und  Possibilien  bei Duns Scotus mit Ausblick auf Franz von Mayronis, Poncius und Mastrius (BGPTM, NF) 60 (Munster:  2002);  J.  Coombs,  'The  Ontological  Source  of  Logical  Possibility  in  Catholic Second Scholasticism,' in The Medieval Heritage in Early Modern Metaphysics and Modal Theory, 1400-1700 ,  ed.  R.  Friedman and L. Nielsen (Dordrecht: 2003), 191-229; J. Schmutz, 'La  querelle  des  possibles.  Recherches  philosophiques  et  textuelles  sur  la  métaphysique jésuite, 1540-1767' (Doctoral Diss., EPHE-ULB: 2003).\n\n$^{6} Some of Scotus's meta-ethical doctrines on the foundation of natural law do play a role in Molina's other master work, the De iustitia et iure ,  but  for  lack  of  space,  we  shall not treat it here. See I. Mandrella, Das Isaak-Opfer: historisch-systematische Untersuchung zu Rationalität und Wandelbarkeit des Naturrechts in der mittelalterlichen Lehre vom natürlichen Gesetz (BGPTM NF) 62 (Munster: 2002), on the problem of divine dispensation of natural law for which Isaac's sacri fi ce is the case study.\n\n$^{5} The phrase is borrowed from D.C. Langston, God's Willing Knowledge: The In luence of f Scotus' Analysis of Omniscience (University Park: 1986), at 53. There are not so many studies explicitly devoted to the question of Molina's relation to Scotus. E. Dekker is an exception; see his two papers 'The Reception of Scotus' Theory of Contingency in Molina and Suarez,' in Via Scoti. Methodologica ad mentem Ioannis Duns Scoti , ed. L. Sileo (Rome: 1995), 445-54 and 'Does Scotus Need Molina? On Divine Foreknowledge and Co-Causality,' in John Duns Scotus, Renewal of Philosophy , ed. E.P. Bos (Atlanta: 1998), 101-11.\n\n$^{7} See J. Schmutz, 'L'héritage des subtils,' 68.\n\nso as to include the conceptual frameworks, the explicit theses, and the more general  (and  less  easily  discernible)  philosophical  outlooks  which display  either  a  positive  or  a  negative  impact  of  Scotus  on  Molina. $^{8} In what follows, I will try to diagnose such an in fl uence on two speci fi c and closely  related  topics:  the  metaphysics  of  free  will  and  the  problem  of divine  foreknowledge.   The $^{9} fi rst  part  of  this  study  provides  a  sketch  of Scotus's theory (sections 1 to 7). In the second part (sections 8 to 13), the results  of  the fi rst  are  confronted  to  Molina's  criticisms  and  to  his  own doctrines.  Finally,  I  will  end  this  conclusion  by  retrospectively  showing how Scotus could be interpreted as reconciling God's foreknowledge and human freedom in a way consistent with Molinism (section 14).\n\nI\n\nThe idea of free will is absolutely central in order to understand Scotus's thought. According to him, the will is essentially a rational power, which means that it is not determined to a single e fect, but instead it is a power f of self-determination. The phrase 'rational power' is taken from Book IX of Aristotle's Metaphysics (1046b4-6), where they are opposed to irrational  powers,  whose  characteristic  feature  is  that  they  are  determined  to a  single  e fect.  For  instance,  given  appropriate  circumstances  (dryness f of  the  atmosphere,  etc.), fi re  burns  wood.  On  the  other  hand  a  rational power  is  such  that,  given  the  same  set  of  circumstances  it  can  either produce  a  given  e fect  or  not  produce  it.  But  Scotus  deeply  transforms f Aristotle's idea. Indeed, according to him, the purely cognitive faculties of\n\n$^{8} The purely historical question of Molina's exact knowledge of Scotus is not addressed here. From the explicit quotations, it appears that Molina knew and read the Ordinatio , especially  Book  I,  dist.  38-39.  I  will  refer  to  the  Vatican  edition:  Ioannes  Duns  Scotus, Opera omnia, studio et cura Commissionis Scotisticae ad fi dem codicum edita (Vatican City: 1950-), referred to as Vat., followed by volume and page number. Whether Molina knew the Quodlibetal Questions and the commentaries on Aristotle, and in particular the Questions on Metaphysics, is more dubious. The Lectura was unknown until its rediscovery by C. Balic in the 1920s. For this reason, I will mostly refer to the Ordinatio .\n\n$^{9} By  a  metaphysic  of  freedom,  I  mean  the  study  of  the  metaphysical  conditions necessary  to  ascribe  freedom  to  a  voluntary  agent,  setting  aside  the  psychological  considerations  that  any  agent  must  satisfy  in  order  to  be  endowed  with  a  will.  Scotus's considerations on free will are not restricted to the purely metaphysical notion of a power of self-determination, but also involve a moral psychological and a speci fi cally ethical perspective; see the texts in Part II of A. Wolter, Duns Scotus on the Will and Morality (1st ed. 1986; Washington: 1997). However Molina's own conceptions in moral psychology are too scattered and cursory to provide a su ffi ciently rich comparison point with Scotus.\n\n328\n\nmind, including the intellect, are irrational in this sense, and are accordingly natural powers ( potentiae naturales ). $^{1}$^{0} The will is the only rational power; it is not subject to causal determinism, and is the only cause of its decisions. $^{1}$^{1} This  involves  a  departure  from  the  Aristotelian  principle according to which every moving thing is moved by something else ( omne quod  movetur  ab  alio  movetur ). $^{1}$^{2} Within  the  Aristotelian  scheme,  only passive potencies (what would be called liabilities), which are unable to actualize by themselves a single e fect, are undetermined: a given piece of f bronze might be shaped as a statue or as a bowl. But according to Scotus, far from betraying an imperfection, the will's indetermination is the hallmark of its excellency, or what Scotus calls a 'superabundant su ffi ciency.' $^{1}$^{3} That  such  a  rational  power  escapes  causal  determinism  but  introduces 'fresh starts' in the causal order of the world is clearly stated by Scotus: 'I say that it is able to do what it does with no conceivable predetermination to act, so that the initial determination, both in the order of nature and in the order of time, occurs in the very placing of its act' ( Questions on Metaphysics , IX, q. 15, n. 66, 000, Will and Morality , 148). Or more brie fl y: 'there is  no  other  cause  [of  the  will's  willing  something  rather  than  something else] to be found except that the will is will' (ibid., n. 29, Will and Morality , 140). Free will is incompatible with causal determinism.\n\nThe existence of such a power of self-determination, and thus of a will, is an intuitive truth, something anyone can experience. $^{1}$^{4} Hence creatures like human beings enjoy free will. But the idea that the will 'could have\n\n$^{1}$^{0} Questions on Metaphysics , IX, q. 15, n. 20-41 ( Opera philosophica vol. III and IV) (New York: 1997), IV, 680-86. There is a clear and useful account of the issues discussed in this paragraph in M.B. Ingham and M. Dreyer, The Philosophical Vision of John Duns Scotus: An Introduction (Washington: 2004) and T. Ho fmann, 'The Distinction between Nature and f Will in Duns Scotus,' Archives d'Histoire Doctrinale et Littéraire 66 (1999): 189-224.\n\n$^{1}$^{2} See Scotus's discussion in Questions on Metaphysics , IX, q. 14, OP IV, 626-73.\n\n$^{1}$^{1} There is disagreement in Scotus scholarship on the respective role of will and intellect in the formation of a volition. Some texts say that intellect and will function as partial co-causes  of  the  volition  (see Lectura II,  d.  25,  q.  un.,  n.  73,  Vat.  XIX,  254),  while  other passages  ascribe  to  the  cognitive  representation  only  the  role  of  a causa  sine  qua  non , leaving  the  will  as  the  total  cause  of  the  volition  ( Rep .  II,  d.  25,  n.  22,  ed.  L.  Wadding [Lyon: 1639], VI, 888). Interpreters disagree over whether these textual di ferences express f a  change  of  opinion  (toward  a  more  radical  voluntarism)  or  not,  and  if  the  answer  to the fi rst  question  is  a ffi rmative,  whether  the  second  position  represents  a  later  stage  of Scotus's thought. For a recent, clear statement of the issue, see Ingham and Dreyer, The Philosophical Vision of John Duns Scotus , 162-72.\n\n$^{1}$^{3} Questions  on  Metaphysics ,  IX,  q.  15,  n.  31,  OP  II,  611, Will  and  Morality ,  140:  'est  et alia superabundantis su ffi cientiae, quae est ex illimitatione actualitatis, vel simpliciter vel quodammodo.'\n\n$^{1}$^{4} Questions on Metaphysics , IX, q. 15, n. 30, OP II, 610.\n\nacted  otherwise'  needs  some  clari fi cation.  Scotus  distinguishes  various senses under which one can be said to be able to will the opposite. First, one may be such that she can have contrary volitions related to the same object,  like  loving  something,  and  later  hating  it.  But  the  will  can  also will di ferent objects: someone who wants to drink may also want to eat. f The fi rst  is  a  power  for  contrary acts, the second is a freedom for di ferf ent objects. Only the latter is essential for freedom, and is found both in God and in creatures, because the former supposes some form of mutability,  which cannot be found in God. $^{1}$^{5} Scotus sets the same distinction in terms of the di ference between not willing ( f non velle ) and willing that not ( nolle ). Thus if I hate something, in some way I refuse it, which Scotus describes as an act of nolition ( nolle ).  But if I freely want to A ,  all  I  need in order to be free, is to be able not to will A .\n\nThere is another crucial distinction concerning the power to act otherwise.  It  can  signify  either  a  manifest  power  to  will  di ferent  acts  and/ f or objects successively, or what Scotus calls a 'not so evident power': the power not to will something at the very instant that one wills something, and vice versa. $^{1}$^{6} The fi rst power is evident: if I swim at some time, I am able to swim even if I am in now in the middle of the desert, provided one indexes the object of the power (i.e. swimming) to a later time than now. But in  order  to  be  free  to  swim,  I  should  have  the  power  to  swim  now, which  I  clearly  lack. $^{1}$^{7} Similarly,  for  my  will  to  be  free,  I  must  have  the power now to refrain from willing what I will. This is a clear consequence of  Scotus's  claim  that  free  will  is  incompatible  with  natural  necessity. $^{1}$^{8} Natural powers are such that given if their causal requisites are present, there is no power at time T for the opposite e fect. By contrast, the will as f a rational power has simultaneously the power to will the opposite or not to will anything at all. However, Scotus does not defend his position via this line of argumentation but instead uses the thought experiment of an angel existing for a single instant of time. This thought experiment allows\n\n$^{1}$^{5} Ord . I, d. 38, p. 2-d.39, q. 1-5 (= I, d.39), n. 15, Vat. VI, 417; n. 21, Vat. VI, 425-26.\n\n$^{1}$^{7} The double time indexing of powers to φ is essential to see how D. Langston is misled when he thinks that powers for Scotus are just abilities, not necessarily including opportunities. Having the power at T to φ at some time or another is enough for a mere ability. But when Scotus claims that freedom of action and/or will requires the power at T to φ at T , this entails that one has the power to φ given the circumstances, which requires that one has the opportunity to exercise the power.\n\n$^{1}$^{6} Ord .

II, 60 : 'Necessitas naturalis non stat cum libertate.'\n\nScotus to disprove any theory that grounds the contingency of an act at T on what happens at any earlier time. Suppose an angel elicits a sinful act. Since sinning requires freedom of the will, this entails that at this very instant, the angel must be able to avoid sinning at this very moment.\n\nII\n\nThe idea of a simultaneous power to will otherwise is only one aspect of a new modal framework which marks a clear departure from older modal paradigms, as Scotus scholars have largely insisted upon. The central feature  of  Scotus's  new  model  is  the  theory  of  synchronic  contingency.  He developed his thought largely in reaction to a form of determinism held by  those  whom  he  names  the  'Philosophers,'  who  promoted  a  broadly Aristotelian  account  of  modality. $^{1}$^{9} A  common  feature  of  these  thinkers was  their  adherence  to  a  version  of  the  Principle  of  Plenitude  (i.e.  no genuine  possibility  remains  unactualized),  which  entails  that  whatever is  eternal  and/or  immutable  is  (absolutely)  necessary.  One  line  of  argument which could lead to this was their strict notion that actualization of  any  potentiality  implies  a  process  of  change.  The  theory  entails  the necessity of the present, expressed by the Aristotelian dictum omne quod est,  necesse  est  esse  quando  est (everything  necessarily  is,  when  it  is, De interpretatione 19a23-27) which is then understood, not as an innocuous conditional  necessity,  but  as  a necessitas  consequentis :  'If A occurs  at T , then it is necessary (from T on) that A occurs at T .'\n\nSince  any  genuine  possible  state  of  a fairs  requires  that  some  actual f potency be able to bring it about, it follows that if some potency is immutable, then whatever results from it, necessarily does so. Therefore, if God is  eternal  and  immutable, then whatever he produces is necessary. As a consequence, contingency is only the result of the impedibility of causal chains relating the fi nite beings, which comes from the essential imperfection of secondary causes.\n\n$^{1}$^{9} Ord .

Normore,  'Duns  Scotus's  Modal  Theory,' in The Cambridge Companion to Scotus , ed. Th. Williams (Cambridge, Eng.: 2003), 129-60.\n\nAccording to Scotus, the latter position is incoherent, for either there is contingency within fi nites things, and so their fi rst cause has to be contingent,  or  God's  productive  action  is  necessary,  and  so  are  its  e fects. f $^{2}$^{0} The background principle of Scotus's fi rst argument is that necessity is a hereditary property: if E is  a  necessary e fect and f E is  a  cause  of E' ,  then E' is  necessary  too. $^{2}$^{1} The  contingency  of  God's  causation  (which  proves according to Scotus that he has will) is a necessary condition of the existence of contingent e fects within the world. Scotus adds two arguments f to  this  one.  The fi rst  is  based  on  the  superiority  of  the fi rst  cause  with respect to any caused event, and the other on the principle that the fi rst cause is able to produce alone any e fect produced by secondary causes. f $^{2}$^{2} Any  state  of  a fairs  that  is  contingent  with  respect  to  secondary  causes f does not cease to be so if it is directly brought about by the fi rst cause.\n\nSince the contingency of our world is a matter of fact, and this cannot consistently  be  denied,  it  follows  that  determinism  is  false. $^{2}$^{3} Moreover, since God acts through his will, and every will is essentially free, it follows that every created e fect is contingent and there is no absolute, but only f relative necessity in the realm of existing things other than God himself. $^{2}$^{4} Contingency is therefore absolutely universal on the one hand and, on the other, it has its root within God's will: 'the divine will is the fi rst ground ( prima ratio )  of  contingency' ( Rep .  I  A,  d.  39-40,  q.  1-3,  n.  35,  ed.  Söder, 248). This does not preclude that there might be other sources of contingency, namely the created wills. $^{2}$^{5}\n\n$^{2}$^{0} Ord .

See Reportatio IA, d. 39-40, n. 30, ed. in J. Söder, Kontingenz, and Wissen (BGPTM, NF) 49 (Munster: 1999), 247.\n\n$^{2}$^{5} Scotus's argumentation at Ord. I,  d.  39,  n.  14,  Vat.  VI,  416  relies  on the possibility of understanding the divine will as a source of contingency on the basis of an understanding of our own created will. This presupposes that the latter are also (limited) sources of contingency. Scotus is even more explicit in Rep. I A, d. 39-40, q. 1-3, n. 36, ed. Söder, 249: 'actus  voluntatis  meae  habet  duplicem causam contingentiae, unam ex parte voluntatis divinae sicut causae primae et aliam ex voluntate mea ut ex secunda causa.'\n\n$^{2}$^{4} Ord .  I,  d.  39,  n.  22,  Vat.  VI,  427:  'ad  quodlibet  ergo  aliud  [ab  essentia  sua]  contingenter  se  habet,  ita  quod  posset  esse  oppositi.'  For  the  relative  necessity  and  absolute contingency of natural events, see Rep. I A, d. 39-40, q. 1-3, n. 38, Söder, 249.\n\nBut  this  contingency  can  be  reconciled  with  God's  immutability  only if  one abandons the model of modality that goes along with the cosmology  criticized  by  Scotus.  In  particular,  he  gives  up  the  necessity  of  the Present. $^{2}$^{6} This  is  clearly  expressed  in  the  following de fi nition of contingency: 'I do not call contingent any non-necessary or non-permanent state of a fairs, but a state of a fairs whose opposite could occur while it occurs' f f ( Ord . I, d. 2, p. 1, q. 1-2 n. 86, Vat. II, 179). The theory of synchronic contingency cannot be separated from the rede fi nition of possibility in terms of logical possibility ( potentia logica ). Some state of a fairs is possible in this f sense if and only if its constitutive elements are nonrepugnant. However, this is never mere logical possibility, since every logical power is actually matched by a real power. And Scotus claims that the will as a real power accompanies the logical possibility of the contrary act. $^{2}$^{7} The  relation  of repugnance is not as strict as logical contradiction, but is closer to semantic incompatibility. For instance, the predicates 'red all over' and 'green all  over'  express  repugnant  properties,  though  their  combination  would not violate any law of logic. $^{2}$^{8}\n\nBy  de fi ning  the  will's  real  power  on  the  basis  of  the  logical  possibility of the two preceding states of a fairs, it might be thought that Scotus f dramatically weakens the 'could have willed otherwise' condition for free will,  in  a  way  that  is  compatible  with  a  compatibilist  conception.  Once again, my swimming now is in itself nonrepugnant, and thus constitutes a possible state of a fairs. All this can be interpreted as a matter of whether f one considers more or less fi ne-grained states of a fairs. If the time index f of the action envisaged and the causal requisites are speci fi ed, then there is indeed some repugnance. For instance, the state of a fairs expressed by f the sentence 'I am at T at a place where none of the conditions required to swim are present and I swim at T ' would be repugnant, and this entails that it is impossible that I swim on this occasion and that I am not free to do it. $^{2}$^{9}\n\n$^{2}$^{6} Restricting  the  latter  to  mere  conditional  necessity,  reinterpreting  the  Aristotelian principle in the following way: 'Necessarily (if A occurs at T , then A occurs at T ).'\n\n$^{2}$^{8} Lectura I, d. 2, p. 2, q. 1-4, n. 246.\n\n$^{2}$^{7} Ord .  I,  d.  39,  n.  16,  Vat.  VI,  418:  'hanc  etiam  potentiam  realem  activam . . . concomitatur potentia logica, quae est non-repugnantia terminorum. Voluntati enim ut actus primus,  non  repugnat  oppositum  velle.'  See Questions on Metaphysics ,  IX,  q.  1-2,  n.  18,  OP IV, 514.\n\n$^{2}$^{9} And so,  when  Scotus  claims  that  a  real  power  is  matched  by  a  logical  possibility, is  not  to  be  read  the  other way round as if the mere per se nonrepugnancy of a state of a fairs  entailed  that  the  agent  has  a  real  power.  To  get  a  real  power,  one  needs  to  add f an extrinsic nonrepugnancy with facts (already existing states of a fairs) to the intrinsic f\n\nThe theory of synchronic contingency must face the charge of violating the law of contradiction. If we suppose that p is true at t and that it is possible at t that p is false at t ,  then, by supposing the possible actualization of notp ,  that would entail that it is possibly true that p is  true at t and p is false at t which is contradictory. In order to avoid such a contradiction, Scotus uses the distinction between the composed and the divides sense. The sentence 'it is possible that S ,  not willing A at T ,  wills A at T ' is true in sensu divisionis but false in sensu composito .  The latter amounts to the contradiction: 'it is possible that ( S wills A at T and that S does not will A at T ).' But in the sense of division, it means that ' S does not will A at T and it is possible at T that S wills A at T ' which is not contradictory, provided one gives up belief in the necessity of the present, and true, since ' S wills that A at T ' is nonrepugnant. $^{3}$^{0} But Scotus goes further and distinguishes an order within the momentary existence of the angel during which he commits a sin. Being free, the sinning angel is able to refrain from sinning at T . However, his act occurs and thus becomes a matter of fact. From the point of view of the agent, the volition is contingent, because he has both the power to sin and the power not to sin. $^{3}$^{1} From the point of view of the volition, it either occurs or not. These two aspects are ordered according to  an  order  of  conceptual priority ( natura prius )  within  a  single  instant. The will, insofar as it is considered as a power for opposites, is naturally prior to its exercising this power one way or the other (Vat. VI, 418). The true proposition corresponding to the divided sense of the sentence thus refers to two distinct instants of nature. As C. Normore summarizes: 'the prior is that in which the angel has both the power to love God and the power to hate God, and the posterior is that in which the angel has actualized  the  power  to  love  God.' $^{3}$^{2} In  a  similar  way,  though  God's  will  is absolutely immutable, he wills contingently his objects, so that while he decides to create A he could at the same time decide to create something else. $^{3}$^{3}\n\nnonrepugnancy.  Scotus  sometimes  calls  the  corresponding  kind  of  necessity necessitas inevitabilitatis . See Rep. I A, d. 39-40, q. 1-3, n. 27, ed. Söder, 246.\n\n$^{3}$^{1} Rational powers are thus endowed with many powers for one e fect. The angel does f not have the contradictory power of sinning and not sinning at the same time, but two powers.\n\n$^{3}$^{0} See Ord . I, d. 39, n. 17, Vat. VI, 419-20.\n\n$^{3}$^{2} C.

I, d. 39, n. 22, Vat. VI, 427.\n\nAbandoning  the  necessity  of  the  present  has  important  consequences concerning  the  relationship  between  time  and  modality.  Though  the present is ontologically determinate, it is nevertheless contingent, so that logical determination does not entail necessity. $^{3}$^{4} This undercuts the fatalist inference in De interpretatione ,  Chapter 9, which derives the necessity of  future states of a fairs from the present truth of the propositions corf responding  to  them.  Nevertheless,  Scotus  does  not  completely  separate time and modality. This appears in his reply to the objection that what is past is necessary and unavoidable, so that God's predestination entails that someone who is predestined is unable to sin. Scotus answers by fi rst conceding the necessity of past states of a fairs. f $^{3}$^{5} The underlying intuition is the commonsense assumption that there are no backward-looking powers. However, since God exists in an eternal present, none of his acts passes away. Therefore, God's acts are eternally contingent, so that God can bring it  about  that  if  someone  sins  now  it  will  never  have  been  true  that  he was predestined. But this opens up a possible discrepancy between God's present and ours, or in other words between what is possible for God, and what is possible for us. $^{3}$^{6} If I was in Rome yesterday, there is nothing I can do now to prevent this from having happened. In contrast, God's eternal present coexists with our past, so that from God's perspective what is possible  never becomes impossible. This, in turn, entails a tension over the nature of pastness.\n\nIV\n\nThus far,  we  have  examined  the  nature  of  free  will  and  of  contingency, its root in both divine and created will, and how it fi ts within the modal\n\n$^{3}$^{4} Ord .

Now, we are in a position to turn to Scotus's account of God's knowledge. There is a preliminary problem concerning the scope of Scotus's inquiry. Traditionally, it is thought that Scotus answers two questions: (1) How does God know future contingents? And (2) is God's knowledge of future events compatible with their contingency? Following E. Dekker, we may call the fi rst the Source question, and the second the Reconciliation question. $^{3}$^{7} Some recent interpreters deny that Scotus answers the Source question, and claim that he tried only to solve the Reconciliation question. There is some textual support for this view, $^{3}$^{8} and it has important consequences on the interpretation of Scotus's position as we will see. However, it is di ffi cult not to read some passages as (perhaps incomplete) explanations of how God can be said to have knowledge of what is contingent. $^{3}$^{9} And,  as  will  appear  later,  Molina  understood  Scotus  as  providing  an account  of  the  Source  question.  This  is  why  I  present  Scotus's  account along the traditional interpretation.\n\nScotus  develops  his  own  account  of  foreknowledge  as  an  alternative to  Aquinas's.  The  latter  tried  to  explain  the  compatibility  between  the certitude  of  divine  foreknowledge  and  the  contingency  of  its  objects  by claiming that, though future events, in relation to the 'now of time' ( nunc temporis ), are not yet actual and thereby contingent, they are nevertheless present to the now of eternity ( nunc aeternitatis ),  and from this point of view their occurrence is determinate and necessary and can be the object of  a  certain  knowledge. $^{4}$^{0} The  idea  of  temporal  things  coexisting  within God's eternity is the core of the theory. Eternity is agreed to be some kind of nonsuccessive duration. $^{4}$^{1} What is contentious is the notion of eternal presence. According to Scotus's realist interpretation, God, being eternal, is present to all the moments of time, and hence, to all events, past, present, and future. $^{4}$^{2} This presence implies a form of simultaneity. Therefore\n\n$^{3}$^{7} See E. Dekker, 'Does Scotus Need Molina?'\n\n$^{3}$^{9} See Rep . I A, d. 38, q. 1-2, n. 11, ed.

See Thomas Aquinas, SCG I, c. 66, n. 7; ST I, q. 10, a. 4, in corp.\n\n336\n\nthings are present in themselves ( in seipsis ) to God, which entails that all moments of time somehow exist tenselessly in the now of eternity, as the points on the circumference of a circle are equidistant to its center, which can be represented as God's eternal now.\n\nWe may now turn to Scotus's positive account. According to him, God's knowledge contains three moments, or instants of nature. The fi rst stage is God's natural knowledge of all necessary propositions. At this stage, every logical possibility is an object of God's knowledge, which depends only on\n\nScotus's objections are based on a dynamical conception of time, according to which the f luxus temporis is an objective feature of existence. $^{4}$^{3} Suppose one starts with the assumption that God coexists with some event E .  This means that God is somehow simultaneous with E occurring at T . Now, if God is present to another event E' ,  occurring at T' future relative to T , then God is simultaneous with E' , and, by the transitivity of simultaneity, E and E' would be simultaneous too, which destroys their temporal order. Furthermore, E' would be real at T , and then it would be impossible for God to create it at T' .  And one could not reply that E '  is  not  yet  real, though  simultaneous  with  God's  eternity,  for  simultaneity  being  a  real relation  requires  that  its  terms  really  exist. $^{4}$^{4} Pace the  parallel  with  the case of immensity, Scotus considers that God's immensity entails that he is present to all existing places, not to possible but nonactual places. Likewise, God's eternity does not entail that nonactual times, like the future, are present to him, only that they will be, when they will be actualized. $^{4}$^{5} Another  objection  is  that  if  God  knew  contingent  events  only  because he perceives them somehow when they are present, then his knowledge would  be  imperfect,  and  could  not  ground  his  providence. $^{4}$^{6} Finally,  if mere coexistence were su ffi cient  to  ground  foreknowledge of the future contingent  states  of  a fairs,  the  angels  would  naturally  foreknow  them, f which is denied by Aquinas himself. $^{4}$^{7}\n\n$^{4}$^{3} See Rep .

Lectura  I, d. 39, n. 85, Vat. XVII, 507; Ord . I, d. 39, n. 35, Vat. VI, 441), or does Scotus grant reality to the past as well? His remarks on the determination and necessity of the past (cf. Ord . I, d. 39, n. 26, Vat. VI, 432) tend to show that past events and states of a fairs are somehow real. See f N.  Lewis,  'Space  and  Time,'  in The  Cambridge  Companion  to  Scotus ,  ed.  Th.

Consider the terms of the relations  of  repugnance  and  compossibility.  These  are  logically  simples and are sometimes called by Scotus notae . Such notae are related to others according to repugnance or compossibility, independently of any power to bring them about. $^{4}$^{8} However, they are not self-subsistent entities, but are  the  products  of  God's  intellectual  activity,  which  thus  endows  them with an ontological status, as intelligible beings. But the logical and modal properties of these entities are not constituted by God's intellectual activity.  Scotus  summarizes  this  by  claiming  that  the possibilia are  formally such from themselves ( formaliter ex se ), but 'principially' from God ( principiative  ab  eo ). $^{4}$^{9} All  logical,  mathematical,  and  metaphysical  truths,  in general all necessary truths, are known at precisely the instant when God produces, thinks things, and produces them in an esse intelligibile .  Moreover,  since  the  relations  of  compossibility  and  repugnance  are  independent  from  God's  intellectual  activity,  any  modal  truth  is  necessarily  so. This  entails  that  anything  possible  is  necessarily  possible.  According  to Scotus, all combinations of compatible notae are objects of God's knowledge,  which  he  calls  also  ideas. $^{5}$^{0} Scotus  is  less  explicit  on  the  content of  ideas  than  on  their  ontological  status,  but  it  is  likely  that  an  idea  is an  intellectual  representation  of  any  object,  either  of  an  individual  like 'Socrates' or of a common nature like 'man' and that it contains everything  that  can  be  grasped  by  God  through  his  intellect  alone.  An  idea would be something like the deductive closure of all necessary truths concerning a given object. For instance, God's intellect produces the notae of animality and rationality and these, being intrinsically nonrepugnant, can be combined in a single subject, man. And man can be combined with an individual di ferentia to produce a possible individual, say 'Socrates.' The f idea  of  Socrates  contains  all  the  properties  grounding  necessary  truths concerning him: that he is a man, that he is a rational animal, and that it\n\n$^{4}$^{8} Ord . I, d. 36, q. un., n. 60-61, Vat. VI, 296. On what follows, see C. Normore, 'Scotus, Modalities, Instants of Nature and the Contingency of the Present,' in John Duns Scotus. Metaphysics and Ethics , ed. L. Honnefelder, R. Wood, and M. Dreyer (STGM) 53 (Cologne: 1996), 161-74.\n\n$^{5}$^{0} Ord . I, d. 35, n. 42, Vat. VI, 263: 'ipsum obiectum cognitum est idea.' Scotus borrows the traditional Platonic terminology, but gives it a very di ferent meaning. Against Henry f of Ghent, he claims that ideas are not ontologically independent entities, enjoying an esse essentiae ( Ord .  I,  d.  36,  n.  34,  Vat.  VI, 284). And against Aquinas, Scotus claims that ideas are not exemplar forms, guiding God's practical knowledge of his creation. See Rep .  I  A, d. 36, q. 3, passim in T. Noone, 'Scotus on Divine Ideas: Rep. Paris. I-A, d.36,' Medioevo 24 (1998): 359-453.\n\n$^{4}$^{9} See Ord . I, d. 43, n. 18, Vat. VI, 369.\n\n338\n\nis possible that he is sitting at T ,  and so on. However, it does not include the property of sitting at T , because it is a contingent truth.\n\nAt this stage of the process, contingent propositions form pairs of contradictories which are disjunctively necessary, therefore true, but none of which  is  true  nor  false.  Each  member  of  such  disjunctions  is  a  neutral proposition that lacks a truth-value. $^{5}$^{5} This, however, does not amount to a  restriction of the Principle of Bivalence (PB), because this stage corresponds to an instant of nature, and there is no time at which contingent propositions lack truth-values. $^{5}$^{6} At this stage there are possible states of a fairs  and  true  propositions f de  possibili ,  but  there  are  literally  no  contingent  states  of  a fairs  nor  true  contingent  propositions  corresponding f\n\nThis  leads  Scotus  to  reject  theories  that  ground  God's  knowledge  of future  contingents  on  his  ideas. $^{5}$^{1} First,  they  can  ground  only  analytical, thus necessary truths. $^{5}$^{2} Moreover, ideas are intellectual representations, excluding any volitional element. They are therefore purely natural occurrences  in  God's  mind.  Since  God's  will  is  the  only  root  of  contingency, it  follows that ideas necessarily have their content and cannot ground a representation of contingent states of a fairs. f $^{5}$^{3} Conversely, suppose that God's knowledge of future contingents were based on ideas, then he would not be omniscient, for he would know that Socrates could be either sitting or standing up at T ,  not that he is sitting at T .  Finally, there would be no more di ference between God's knowledge of what is actual and of what f is simply possible. The thrust of Scotus's criticism is his claim that being a  purely  intellectual,  prevolitional,  representation  and  being  the  representation  of  something  contingent  are  incompatible  properties.  Since  it is  a  natural  power,  God's  intellect  can  ground  neither  the  truth  nor  the knowledge of anything contingent. $^{5}$^{4}\n\n$^{5}$^{1} It can be attributed to Bonaventure, In Sent .

At  136 f., f he  discusses  a  similar  objection  from  Gregory  of  Rimini, Lectura I,  d.  38,  q.  2,  a.  2,  ed. D. Trapp - V.

This alethic (and a fortiori ontological) indetermination entails an epistemic indetermination: in the fi rst  instant  of  nature,  God  has  no determinate knowledge of what is contingent. $^{5}$^{7}\n\nIt may be remarked that Scotus is not very explicit on the combinations of  simple  states  of  a fairs.  Compossibility  is  the  fundamental  relation. f Since it is de fi ned in terms of non repugnantia alone, it is not a transitive relation (i.e. it is possible that A is compossible with B and B compossible with C and yet A is not compossible with C ). Compossibility alone is therefore not rich enough a relation to partition all possible states of a fairs into f maximal collections of states of a fairs,  or  possible  worlds.  At  this  level, f there seem thus to be possible situations, but not what we would call possible worlds. There is however a privileged class of states of a fairs, those f that get actualized through God's choice. This can be described as a complete possible situation and Scotus sometimes uses the phrase ordo rerum to characterize it. Therefore at least the actual world is similar to a possible world. Moreover, Scotus sometimes speaks of various ordines rerum each corresponding to some hypothetical exercise of God's ordained power. $^{5}$^{8} Though this might look a bit speculative, one could interpret that as the tacit  recognition  that  just  as  the  states  of  a fairs  constituting  the  actual f ordo rerum are selected through God's will, the other ordines are de fi ned by which states of a fairs God could decide to co-create. In this respect, it f is not inappropriate to see Scotus's modal framework as an anticipation of modern possible world modal semantics and metaphysics. $^{5}$^{9} Just as God's intellect  constitutes  the  ontological  ground  to  his  knowledge  of  necessary truths, his will is the root of his knowledge of contingent truths. This means that God produces some states of a fairs in a 'willed being' ( f esse volitum ) which only actual states of a fairs enjoy, and that he determines f through  his  will  which  contingent  propositions  are  true,  and  which  are false. He decides to actualize one of the states of a fairs corresponding to f any pair of contradictory neutral propositions. By actualizing such a state\n\n$^{5}$^{7} Rep. I A, d. 38, q. 1-2, n. 37, ed. Söder, 233.\n\n$^{5}$^{9} See D.C. Langston, God's Willing Knowledge and S. Knuuttila, Modalities in Medieval Philosophy .  I  would share C. Normore's verdict: 'although one can fi nd the ingredients in Scotus's picture for talking about possible worlds, the notion would do little or no work within that picture itself' ('Duns Scotus's Modal Theory,' 155). See below, section 12, for additional reservations.\n\n$^{5}$^{8} Talking about the nature of God's ordained power, Scotus claims for instance in Ord I, d. 44, q. un., n. 8, Vat. VI, 366: ' fi eret ordinate secundum alium ordinem, quem ordinem ita posset voluntas divina statuere sicut potest agree.' This alius ordo is clearly a maximal collection of compossible states of a fairs. f\n\nof  a fairs,  God's  will  makes  the  corresponding  proposition  true,  and  its f contradictory false. God's will is thus somehow the truth-maker of every true contingent proposition. $^{6}$^{0} It is an appropriate truth-maker, since it is a rational power: while he wills that some proposition p is true, he could at the same time will that p is  false. Let us summarize through an example: eternal happiness and its negation are both compossible with Peter's essence, and so in a fi rst instant of nature, God knows that it is possible that Peter is happy, and that it is possible that Peter is miserable. Then, in  a  second instant of nature, God decrees that Peter should be granted eternal happiness, thereby making true 'Peter will be happy.' Finally, in a third instant of nature, God knows through his intellect that Peter will be happy. $^{6}$^{1} In the three versions of his commentary on Sentences I, d. 39, Scotus adds a modi fi ed version in order to avoid the charge of introducing discursivity  within  God's  intellect,  which  would  compromise  the  latter's simplicity.  In  the  second  version,  God  does  not  infer  knowledge  of  contingent propositions on the basis of the knowledge of his own decrees. $^{6}$^{2} Rather, while he decrees that p rather  than not-p is  true  (for  contingent p ), his essence represents ipso facto the truth of p and is the whole ratio cognoscendi of any such truth. $^{6}$^{3}\n\nV\n\nThe solution proposed by Scotus to the Source question seems straightforward, but when we turn to the Reconciliation problem, matters become\n\n$^{6}$^{0} The  phrase esse  volitum appears  in Ord .  I,  d.  39,  n.  31,  Vat.  VI,  439.  On  God's  will as  a  truth-maker  for  contingent  truths,  see Ord . I,  d.  39,  n.  23,  Vat.  VI,  428:  'voluntas eligens  unam  partem . . . facit  illud  esse  determinate  verum  'hoc  erit  pro a ' ';  ibid.  Vat. VI,  429:  'posita  autem  determinatione  voluntatis  divinae,  iam  sunt  vera  in  illo  secundo instanti';  n.  30,  Vat.

Söder,  234: 'voluntate acceptante alteram partem contradictionis determinate, facta est unio in esse volito  istorum  terminorum  contingentium . . . et  complexio  vera  determinate.'  As  Beck ('Divine Psychology and Modalities,' 130) rightly observes, truth is an absolute notion and God's will is factive, so that what God decrees is actual and therefore true. This means that what is merely possible is, strictly speaking not true.\n\n$^{6}$^{2} Ord .  I,  d.  39,  n.  23,  Vat.

Suppose that God has decreed that p (e.g. 'Agent S wills A at T '),  and thereby foreknows it. If the agent is free, this seems to entail that he could exercise his power of not willing A at T .  But then, either he would do something contrary to God's knowledge which would threaten  his  infallibility, $^{6}$^{4} or  God's  decree  that p would  not  be  a  su ffi -cient condition for his knowing that p .  William Ockham argued that the theory  leads  to  a  dilemma:  either  God's  decree  is  a  su ffi cient  condition for God's knowledge, but then no one's act is necessitated by it, and it is not possible to act contrary to what one actually does; or one is free and then God's knowledge is not secured by the determination of his will. $^{6}$^{5} The synchronic theory of contingency guarantees that p is  contingent in itself, insofar as it proceeds from an ever-present decree of God. However, this  contingency is just an e fect of God's contingent willing, who, or so f it  seems,  is  the  only  being  endowed  with  actual  free  will.  Thus  Scotus's theory, though it leaves room for some form of contingency, $^{6}$^{6} would rule out the existence of created free will satisfying the conditions set out by Scotus.  This  has  led  some  Scotus  scholars  to  suspect  that  his  theory  is inconsistent. $^{6}$^{7} According to others, the theory is consistent, because Scotus is in e fect a proponent of (theological) determinism. Appearances notf withstanding, Scotus would not develop a libertarian notion of free will, and the notion of a power for contraries must be understood as requiring nothing  more  than  a  mere  ability  (or  even  the  mere  logical  possibility) to  act  in  a  contrary  way. $^{6}$^{8} Finally,  some others embrace a diametrically opposed interpretation and maintain that Scotus is a full-blown libertarian  with  respect  to  human  free  will.  But  then,  one  is  obliged  to  answer Ockham's challenge on Scotus's behalf. $^{6}$^{9}\n\n$^{6}$^{4} See Ord .  I,  d.  39,  n.  24,  Vat.  VI,  429-30; Rep .

This problem is  extensively discussed in other passages, especially in the commentary on Sent .  II,  d. 37. $^{7}$^{0} Scotus discusses a strongly libertarian and incompatibilist position, which the Vatican editors ascribe to Peter John Olivi. $^{7}$^{1} The core thesis is the a ffi rmation that the will can be free only if it is absolutely undetermined,  in  other  words,  only  if  it  is  a causa  totalis  et  immediate respectu suae volitionis .  The  position  discussed  by  Scotus  holds  thus  the following claim:\n\nIf agent S has it within his power to will A , then there cannot be a causal requisite R of S' willing such that (i) A cannot occur without R's causing and (ii) R is not within S' power.\n\nArmed with this principle, Olivi argues that if God's willing were a condition satisfying (i) it would also satisfy (ii), and therefore exclude S' freely willing.  The  reason  is  that  God's  will  exists  eternally  so  that  our  temporally limited willing could not control it. Scotus concedes that Olivi's position  provides  an  easy  answer  for  excusing  God  from  the  responsibility of  evil. $^{7}$^{2} But  it  cannot  be  reconciled  with  the  exclusive  role  of  God  in predestination, and more generally, with the idea of hierarchy of causes. Moreover,  it  would  undermine  the  infallibility  of  God's  knowledge  of future contingents, if it is based on God's knowledge of his own decrees. This  leads  Scotus  to  provide  an  alternative  account.  In  order  to  achieve that, he uses the device of partial causes cooperating to produce a single e fect. f $^{7}$^{3} There is nothing new to the idea that God's action is necessary to sustain the created world's existence and causal activity within it. What is distinctive of Scotus's position is the way he integrates his account within a  general  theory  of  partial,  cooperating  causes. $^{7}$^{4} In  general,  he  distin-\n\ninterpreters,  see  A.

II, d. 34-37, q. 5, n. 117 and n. 142-43.\n\nguishes three ways distinct causes might be ordained in the production of a single e fect. Accidentally ordained causes are such that a single cause f could independently produce the whole e fect if its power were intensif fi ed,  as  when  two  horses  are  needed  to  pull  a  cart,  one  of  them  could nevertheless su ffi ce, provided he were strong enough. The next two cases concern essentially ordered causes. Sometimes, the causal activity of the subordinated cause is wholly consequent upon the fi rst  cause's  activity. This  happens  when,  for  instance,  the  hand  moves  a  sta f:  the  sta f  has f f no motion of its own, but only as it is acted upon by the hand. $^{7}$^{5} Finally, the  two  causes  sometimes  play  an  essentially  distinct  and  complementary causal role, though one is ontologically superior to the other. As an example, Scotus mentions the generation of a child, which requires the actions of both the father and the mother as its immediate causes, though the male is considered as intrinsically superior to the female.\n\nIn  the  present  case,  God  and  the  created  will  can  be  considered  as two  partial  cooperating  causes  of  the  third  kind.  Contrary  to  Aquinas's account, God's will does not act directly on the created will, but cooperates with the latter in order to produce a single volition. From this point of view, the actualization of a causal power does not need the in fl uence of the fi rst cause, except for its sustaining in existence. This remains vague, however, for God's primacy could still imply some way of determining the created  will's  causation.  But  God  would  be  guilty  of  sin  if  his  causation were the root of the de fi ciency constitutive of the sinful action. With the help of this idea, Scotus develops his own solution to the problem of God's concurrence to sin. It is worth quoting at length:\n\nThus, if the created will and the divine will concur to the created will's willing, there can be a defect in the willing itself due to the defect of one of the two causes. And from this 000, because this cause could give rectitude to its act, and is bound to give, but nevertheless does not, while the other cause, though it is not bound to give it, nevertheless 'so far as it is in itself ' ( quantum est ex se ),  would give it, if the created will were to cooperate. Indeed,\n\ncognition and then again. In Lectura II,  d.  25,  n.  71-73,  Vat.  XVII,  253-54, Scotus pictures the  intellect  and  will  in  the  production  of  a  volition  as  two  partial,  cooperating  causes. See above n. 000.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\neverything God gave antecedently, He would give consequently (so far as it is in Himself), unless there should be an impediment. By giving to the free will,  He  gave  antecedently  the  right  works  ( opera recta )  which  are  within the  will's  power.  And  thus,  as  for  His  part,  He  gave  rectitude  to  every  act of will-and He would give consequently to the will, if the will itself were to cause rightly any elicited act as for its part ( ex parte sui ). . . . The superior cause quantum est ex se would cause, if the inferior would cause according to its own causality ( Ord . II, d. 34-37, q. 5, n. 143-44, Vat. VIII, 428-29).\n\nAccording  to  this  passage,  neither  evil  acts  would  occur  without  a  created  will's  causality,  nor  would  righteous  action  without  God's  concurrence. To understand the whole process, one needs to start from the will's power for opposites. (i) If S actualizes her power for A , and A is right, God would concur with S by producing the needed rectitude in A . But (ii) if S actualizes her power for notA ,  then God would not concur with S .  As  a consequence, S' action would not be right nor meritorious, and S would sin,  because he could have chosen to actualize A instead.  The combination  of  (i)  and  (ii)  entails  a  kind  of  counterfactual  dependency  of  God's will (which is presupposed by his concurrence and foreknowledge) upon the created will's choice. In case (i), God wills that A , whereas in case (ii), God is said only to permit A .  This  dependency  is  asymmetrical,  for  it  is not required in the case of the meritorious actions of the predestined, but only to explain how one can excuse God from any responsibility for sin. One might wonder if the discussion of this issue does not rest on a di ferf ent account of foreknowledge from the one explicitly developed earlier. Indeed, according to Scotus:\n\n- (1) f I S is free and wills A , then (i) God eternally foreknows that S wills A and (ii) if S had not willed A , God would have foreknown that S does not will A .\n\nIf  one  maintains that foreknowledge is based on a divine decision, then (ii) amounts to:\n\n- (1') ii')  If ( S had not willed A ,  then God would have decreed that S does not will A .\n\nBut then there seems to be a covariance of God's decrees with the creatures'.  If  one  reminds  that  God's  decrees,  being  eternal,  never  fade  into past, and remain forever contingent, one might conclude that the power not to will A remains within S' power even if it is foreknown that S shall\n\nwill A . Scotus's position as it is exposed in this passage is consonant with a  form  of  libertarianism,  though  not  of  the  extreme  incompatibilism defended  by  Olivi.  He  would  modify  the  latter's  condition  for  freedom, by revising the power condition: some requisite might be such that they are  neither  within  the  will's  power  nor  independently  given.  This  new account  has  the  advantage  of  rendering  God's  foreknowledge  and  the will's  freedom  compatible,  and  enabling  to  answer  Ockham's  challenge. The trouble is that, though not inconsistent with the 'o ffi cial'  view,  this account departs from the latter's greater intelligibility as a theory of how God knows future contingents. For such an infallible covariance without any dependence of God's will upon knowledge of the creature's decisions runs the risk of looking either as something like a cosmic coincidence or a pure mystery of faith. $^{7}$^{6}\n\n## VII\n\nWe are now in a position to grasp Molina's relation to Scotus's thought. To begin with, I shall examine Molina's conception of free will and divine concurrence, where Scotus's in fl uence is most explicit. Then I will examine  the  criticisms  raised  by  the  Jesuit  against  the  Subtle  Doctor  against the latter's account of foreknowledge. Finally, after a brief examination of Molina's theory of foreknowledge, I will try to assess, beyond the apparent points of agreement and criticisms, the deep-level relations between these two thinkers.\n\nMolina's  de fi nition  of  free  will  ( liberum  arbitrium )  clearly  has  Scotist roots. Both consider the will as both the locus and the source of freedom, against the preeminence of the intellect, which characterizes the Thomistic\n\n$^{7}$^{6} Whatever its obscurities, many theologians of the Renaissance, under the in fl uence of Scotus, articulated such a theory of concomitant decrees. Among others, the Franciscans Antonio de Cordoba and Andrés de Vega proposed such views. Cf. Antonio de Cordoba, Quaestionarium theologicum , I, q. 55, dub. 11-12, 000; Andrés de Vega, Tridentini decreti de Iusti fi catione expositio et defensio ,  000 (Alcala: 1564), 000; Andrés de Vega in Anfray 2004, 202, n. 57. According to the latter, if the will is free, then if S wills A , then God has decreed that S would  will A ,  but S has  the  power  not  to  will A ,  and  if  he  actualized  this  power, then God would have eternally decreed that S would not have willed A . Among the Jesuits, Gabriel Vázquez seems to have developed an answer to the foreknowledge dilemma based on such concomitant decrees (000).\n\n346\n\n## jean pascal anfray -\n\ntradition. $^{7}$^{7} Will is a free cause according to Molina. $^{7}$^{8} It enjoys a freedom from necessity which is de fi ned in the following way:\n\nThat  agent  is  free,  which,  when  all  requisites  for  acting  are  present,  can act  and  not  act,  or  act  in  such  a  way  that  it  can  equally  act  in  a  contrary way.  And  it  is  because  of  such  a  freedom  that  the  faculty  through  which such an agent can act this way is said to be free. . . . And free will ( liberum arbitrium ) . . . is  nothing  else  but  the  will,  which  is  formally  free  according to our de fi nition, when it is preceded by a judgment of reason ( Concordia , disp. 2, n. 3, ed. Antwerpen, 8a).\n\nAlthough Molina does not give up the requirement of rationality in order that a being be free, his de fi nition shows that the essential property of a free agent is that her actions do not occur deterministically. That is to say, if agent S is  free, then there is no set of requisites R prior to S' s choosing some  course  of  action A such  that R entails  that S wills  that A .  This  is Molina's way of understanding freedom as a potestas ad opposita , a power for  opposites. $^{7}$^{9} Molina's  insistence  on  the  fact  that  such  a  power  is  to be understood in sensu composito shows that free will does not involve a simple ability fl owing from the nature of the agent, but also the presence of a real opportunity. For instance, someone who is constantly chained to a  seat  during an interval of time T ,  thereby loses her power to stand up and is therefore not free during T . $^{8}$^{0} On the contrary, if she desires to sit\n\n$^{7}$^{7} Concordia ,  disp.  2,  n.  9.  I  will  quote  from A.J. Freddoso's translation when possible. In other cases, I will refer to the second edition of the work in the Antwerpen edition of 1595.\n\n$^{7}$^{9} Concordia , disp. 2, n. 3; cf. disp. 53, memb. 2, n. 17.\n\n$^{7}$^{8} Concordia , disp. 24, n. 8.\n\n$^{8}$^{0} D. Langston acknowledges this, and considers that Molina departs from Scotus on this  score  (see God's willing  Knowledge ,  67).  But  one  must  be  cautious  here,  for  if  some situation H is  such  that  one  would  certainly  choose  some  de fi nite  course  of  action,  one does not lose one's freedom, if some distinct agent actualizes and maintains situation H . If I were presented a box of chocolate, I would take one, but I do not lose my free will just because I am repeatedly o fered some, and do not decline any. Molinist free will entails f the power to will the opposite of what one actually wills in certain circumstances, not the power to control the circumstances where one fi nds himself into.  The theory of middle knowledge ( infra ) rests on this idea: an agent, having both the ability and the opportunity to will the opposite in a situation H , is such that if placed in H , he would (freely) do A and some agent, say God, knows this and has the power to ensure that S is placed in H . Moreover, one could exploit this idea to reinterpret some passages where Scotus claims that the blessed in heaven are free to love God, though he prevents them from sinning ( Ord . IV, d. 49, q. 6, n. 11, Wadding X, 455). According to Langston the situation is analogous to the case where someone is chained to a seat and, while having an ability to stand up, is deprived of the opportunity to do so ( God's willing Knowledge , 40-41, 50, and 122-23). Scotus's own example of the eye retaining the power to see the sky, in spite of the presence of a perpetually intervening obstacle, apparently comforts Langston's interpretation. But it is possible\n\nand sees that there is nothing wrong to this, then she is free only if these psychological (and other causal) requirements do not entail that she will sit, but leave it open for her to stand up. This feature explains why Molinist  freedom is also called freedom of indi ference, which means that the f motives presented by the intellect do not determine the will to its choice. $^{8}$^{1} Molina argues as Scotus did, that the existence of free will is a matter of psychological experience and cannot be rationally denied. $^{8}$^{2}\n\nFinally,  Molina  subscribes  to  Scotus's  idea  of  a  non-evident  power  of the will to simultaneously will A and not will A . This is the central thrust of  disputation  24  of  the Concordia , where  Molina  overturns  Ockham's arguments against the idea of a synchronic power for opposites. Ockham had objected to Scotus's non-evident power for opposites, that it entails a denial of the law of contradiction and refused to countenance instants of nature. According to Ockham, one is free to will either of two contradictory courses of action before the time T when the volition is elicited. But at T , if one wills A , this makes refraining from A impossible. In other words, dual possibility is essentially forward-looking. $^{8}$^{3} According to Molina, this entails  that  one  is  free  just  before  one  acts,  but  not  at  the  time  when an  act  is  elicited.  Since  he  assumes  that  one  is  responsible  for  an  act A occurring at T ,  only  if  one  is  free  at T ,  he  infers  that  Ockham's denial of the Scotist simultaneous power for opposites leads to a denial of responsibility. Moreover, Molina rehearses Scotus's case of the angel existing for a  single  instant  of  time,  or  of  the  actual  angels  at  the  moment  of  their creation. $^{8}$^{4} According  to  Molina,  such  an  angel  is  free  at  this  moment, otherwise he could not be responsible for what he does. He avoids falling into contradiction by using the Scotist device of the distinction of many instantia naturae within a single temporal instant. $^{8}$^{5} While he wills A at T , such an angel must also have at T the power to refrain from A . This power\n\nto understand Scotus di ferently (by extrapolating a bit from Scotus's f fi nal answer ibid. n. 15, Wadding X, 457), if one considers it as a situation where God constantly maintains the situation under which he knows that the blessed will freely avoid sinning. The distinction here is very like the one proposed by Freddoso, 26-28.\n\n$^{8}$^{2} Concordia , disp. 23, memb. 1, Antwerpen, 89b-90a.\n\n$^{8}$^{1} See Concordia , disp. 2, n. 6, Antwerpen, 8b and n. 9, Antwerpen, 9a.\n\n$^{8}$^{3} Ockham, Ordinatio , I, d. 38, q. un., OTh IV, 581.\n\n$^{8}$^{5} Concordia disp. 24, n. 8. Such instants are o ffi cially distinct by a distinction of reason, for Molina clearly says elsewhere that it is: 'priority in our way of conceiving it, but with a basis in reality' Concordia , disp. 53, pt. 1, n. 20, trans. Freddoso, 211. However, when he uses the device of instants of nature in the case of volition, he seems to abandon this view.\n\n$^{8}$^{4} Concordia , disp. 24, n. 6; see Schmutz, 'Du péché de l'ange à la liberté d'indi férence,' f for a much more detailed historical analysis of this point.\n\n## 348\n\nis  related  to  an  earlier  instant  of  nature N1 ,  while  the  elicited  volition  is related to a later part of T, N2.\n\nHowever,  the  two  thinkers'  positions  are  only  super fi cially  identical on  this  score.  The  latter,  considering  the  temporal  instant  as  a  whole, maintains that the present is contingent and sees the order of instants of nature as a logical order that does not constitute a parallel quasi-temporal order. On the other hand, according to Molina, the order of natural priority seems to be a discontinuous and irreversible order. He grants that the will is free at N1 to will A and not to will A .  But once its choice, say A ,  is considered as elicited from the point of view of N2 ,  the  power to refrain from A is  destroyed,  and  it  becomes  necessary  that S wills A . $^{8}$^{6} It  could thus be seen as a more fundamental quasi-time order. Therefore, Molina is better seen as downplaying the Aristotelian thesis of the necessity of the present, rather than rejecting it outright, as Scotus does.\n\n## VIII\n\nThe idea of God's general concurrence with created secondary causes is another aspect of Scotus's in fl uence on Molina's thought. $^{8}$^{7} Scotus's conception is an alternative to that of Thomas Aquinas, according to whom creatures act as secondary causes only by participation to God's causation. On the contrary, as we have seen earlier, Scotus conceives their respective contribution on the model of concurring partial causes producing a total e fect. The central tenet of this new paradigm is that God does not act f on the  secondary cause to produce the e fect, but God cooperates f with the created  cause  in  order  to  produce  a  single,  uni fi ed  e fect.  Molina  sides f with Scotus against the Thomistic account. He objects to the latter that it is based on the mistaken idea that creatures' causal powers are essentially incomplete and thus need a kind of motio from their fi rst cause. However, this  would  ruin  the  very  possibility  of  distinguishing  a  causal  power,  be it  natural  or  free,  from  a  mere  requisite.  What  distinguishes  the  former is  that  they  are  complete.  Therefore,  God  is  a  partial,  concurring  cause, along with the created cause. He is absolutely necessary in the sense that\n\n$^{8}$^{6} Concordia disp. 24, n. 5, 9, and 11.\n\n$^{8}$^{7} Concordia disp.  25-28 and the 1572 Quaestio de concursu generali in Geschichte des Molinismus. Bd. I. Neue Molinaschriften , ed. F. Stegmüller (Munster: 1935). More on this in J. Schmutz, 'La doctrine médiévale des causes et la théologie de la nature pure (XIII -XVI e e siècles),' Revue  thomiste 1-2  (2001):  217-64.  In  the Concordia disp.  35,  Antwerpen,  1595, 146b, Molina explicitly refers to Scotus, Ordinatio IV, d. 1, q. 1 000.\n\nno e fect could occur without his causal contribution. However, he does f not determine by himself the nature of the e fect. Rather, God's causation f is  more  like  a  general  power,  which  is  determined  when  it  is  conjoined with a secondary cause's causation. $^{8}$^{8} This is the reason why God's concurrence is characterized as 'indi ferent.' f $^{8}$^{9} Thus not only does Molina give up  the  Thomistic  model  of  the  structure  of  action,  he  also  presents  an altogether di ferent account of its modality. This is particularly important f in the case of created free causes: given God's concurrence with agent S , it  is  both  possible  for S to  will A and  to  refrain  from  willing A .  In  other words, Molina includes God's concurrence among the requisites relative to which the will is indi ferent. f\n\nWhat  is  remarkable  is  that,  while  the  theory  has  clear  antecedents within Scotus, Molina uses it in order to argue against another central Scotist  thesis,  namely that God's will is the root of contingency. He devotes the whole of disputation 35 and part of disputation 47 to refute this last claim. He rehearses Scotus's threefold argumentation, from the transitivity of causal necessity; from the primacy of the fi rst cause with respect to the  created  e fect;  and  from  on  the  causal  su f ffi ciency  of  the fi rst  cause. Molina  claims  that  all  these  arguments  are  unconvincing.  The  last  two entail that God is the only contingent cause, and therefore lead to theological  determinism. The fi rst  argument is incompatible with the theory of concursus  indi ferens f ,  which  has  two  consequences.  First,  under  the impossible assumption that God were acting as a necessary (i.e. natural) agent, there would nevertheless remain contingency within the world. $^{9}$^{0} The reason is simple according to Molina: since the e fect cannot occur f if  one  of  its  partial  causes  does  not  produce  part  of  its  work,  then,  even if  one  cause  acts  necessarily,  the  e fect  would  not  occur if  the  other  did f not  act.  The  theory  of  general  concurrence  neutralizes  so  to  speak  the modality of God's action. Conversely, if God were acting as a free agent, but there were no other, created free agents, then, under the supposition\n\n$^{8}$^{8} See A.J. Freddoso 'Introduction,' in Luis de Molina, On Divine Foreknowledge: Part IV of the Concordia (Ithaca: 1988), 17.\n\n$^{9}$^{0} Concordia , disp. 35, Antwerpen, 1595, 147a: 'esto necesario moveatur, non tamen necessario movere, quando motus quem recipit, neque est tota, neque su ffi ciens causa eius motus, qui ab ipsa emanare debet, sed adhuc ad eum necessaria est, tanquam pars causae libera  cooperation  et  in fl uxus causae ita  motae.  quare  esto  per  impossibile  Deus  necessitate  naturae  in fl ueret  eadem auxilia  gratiae,  quae  reipsa  confert,  maneret  nihilominus libertas in voluntate nostra.'\n\n$^{8}$^{9} Molina, Quaestio de concursu generali , ed. Stegmüller, 199: 'concursus Dei universalis nihil aliud est, quam in fl uxus Dei immediatus in omnes e fectus.' f\n\nthat  God  does  not  act  miraculously,  all  e fects  that  do  not  immediately f depend on God's causal activity (i.e. events like the creation of the world, the  Incarnation,  etc.) $^{9}$^{1} would  happen with a fatal necessity, because all secondary free causes would have been removed. $^{9}$^{2} This kind of necessity is de fi ned by Molina as a causal modality, one that results when the occurring of one event is deterministically entailed by the existence of a chain of earlier events. $^{9}$^{3} Thus according to Molina, causal modalities, contrary to logical modalities, are not absolute nor are they relative to God's causal contribution, but they are relative to the order or secondary causes: E is naturally contingent if E is the e fect of a contingent, secondary cause (i.e. f a free cause). $^{9}$^{4} Therefore, God cannot be the root of contingency within the world, though it may be conceded that he is its remote source insofar as he freely decided to create the world. The theory of general concurrence leads Molina to a position that is super fi cially similar to the position criticized by Scotus, namely that there can be contingency within things even if  the fi rst  cause is necessary. The similarity is super fi cial,  because those criticized by Scotus were mostly determinists, or at least they considered that contingency was a kind of imperfection, deriving from the imperfection of secondary causes. As we have seen, Scotus treats contingency as a mode of being, on a par with necessity, and Molina shares the same point of view. $^{9}$^{5} What separates the two thinkers is their understanding of the role of divine will. For Scotus, it is the ultimate root of any contingency, while  Molina  grants  that  there  are  as  many  quasi-independent  roots  of contingency as there are free causes. He is led to this position by splitting two closely connected Scotist theses, namely, that God's will is the root of contingency, and that God and creature act as essentially ordered cocauses to produce a single e fect. While he develops the latter as one of the f cornerstones of his thought, he thinks that the fi rst is clearly incompatible with it. He is thus led to claim that Scotus is essentially incoherent.\n\n$^{9}$^{1} Concordia , disp. 47, n. 4, see Freddoso 'Introduction,' 20-21.\n\n$^{9}$^{3} Concordia , disp. 47, n. 2; notice that, as remarked by Freddoso at note 19 on p. 94 of his translation, the causal necessity of the occurring of any event presupposes as a condition  that  God  does  not  miraculously suspend his general concurrence; see also disp. 47, n. 12.\n\n$^{9}$^{2} Concordia , disp. 47, n. 9.\n\n$^{9}$^{4} Concordia , disp. 47, n. 10.\n\n$^{9}$^{5} Scotus, Ord . I, d. 39, n.35, Vat. VI, 444: 'contingentia est modus positivus entis (sicut necessitas  est  alius  modus) . . . immo  contingentia  per  prius  est  a  causa  prima  quam secunda.' Cf. Ibid., n. 13, Vat. VI, 414-15.\n\nThe treatment of Aquinas's theory of God's foreknowledge of future contingents as based on their presence to God in eternity is indeed another instance of Molina's complex relationship to Scotus. On the one hand, he defends the coherence of the idea of successive events coexisting in eternity and so he seems to counter Scotus's own arguments against Aquinas, which are rehearsed at the beginning of disputation 48. Signi fi cantly, he accuses Scotus of overlooking the fact that the present tense locution ' E coexists  with  Eternity'  may  connote  either  the  now  of  time  or  the  now of  eternity. $^{9}$^{6} Thus  when  Scotus  claims  that  coexistence  cannot  relate events occurring at successive moments of time T and T' ,  he  thinks that ' E coexists at T with E *'  expresses  Aquinas's  thesis.  But  this  sentence  is plainly false, and ' E coexist in eternity with E *' is the correct expression of  Aquinas's  thesis.  Thus  it  might  seem  that  Molina  opposes  Scotus  on this score.\n\nAnother argument is directly inherited from Scotus: if the presence of things  in  divine  eternity  were  su ffi cient  to  ground  foreknowledge,  then the angels too should be conceded foreknowledge. Molina considers the traditional answer given by the Thomists, namely that, though the aevum is  an  indivisible  duration  measuring  the  existence  of  the  angelic  substances,  their  operations,  in  particular,  the  acts  of  cognition,  are  not  so indivisible,  but  rather  successive.  But  as  a  rejoinder,  Molina  claims  that it  is  possible  that  God conserves a single act of angelic cognition, which would be indivisible and would embrace all events.\n\nHowever, Molina is much closer to the Subtle Doctor's conception of time  and  eternity  than  it  might  seem.  First  of  all,  he  rejects  Aquinas's theory as a su ffi cient explanation of God's foreknowledge. His objections re fl ect the same conceptions as those underpinning Scotus's own objections. A fi rst argument establishes that the presence of things in eternity cannot  account  for  God's  knowledge  before  his  decision  to  create  the world, for either such knowledge is based on God's knowledge of his own intentions, or things would exist in eternity independently of God's decisions which would preclude the exercise of any providence. $^{9}$^{7}\n\nNonetheless,  the  most  interesting  argument  starts  from  the  idea  that future  events  are  still  contingent,  and  so  are  really  able  not  to  occur.\n\n$^{9}$^{6} Concordia , disp. 48, n. 8-9.\n\n$^{9}$^{7} Concordia , disp. 49, n. 15; De scientia Dei , ed. Stegmüller, 227-28.\n\n352\n\nSuppose  that  some  such  event  does  not  occur,  this  implies  that  it  is able  not  to  exist  in  eternity.  It  acquires  a  de fi nite  existence  only  from the  moment  of  its  occurrence.  But  then  it  would  be  wrong  to  say  that God has had an infallible knowledge of this event at any time before this moment. Using the parallel with God's immensity, Molina claims that just as God's immensity does not coexist with nonexistent places, neither does his  eternity  coexist  with  not  yet  existing  moments.  In  Molina's  technical  vocabulary,  adequate eternity corresponds to the whole of time, but this correspondence is not completed until the whole of time has elapsed. When eternity  is  considered  as  corresponding  to  a  stretch  of  time,  it  is taken inadequately and as such, it does not coexist with what follows. $^{9}$^{8} To  illustrate  this,  he  uses  Scotus's  example  of  a  circle  in  the  process  of being drawn. The center corresponds only to the points of the circumference  that  have  been  actually  traced,  but  not  the  ones  that  are  not  yet drawn. This entails a dynamical conception of time, and a notion of eternity  closer  everlastingness  than  to  strict  atemporal  duration. $^{9}$^{9} On  the whole, it appears that Molina's and Scotus's views on the nature of time and eternity di fer only verbally. f\n\nX\n\nThe debate actually bears on a di ferent issue, namely the relation between f time and modality. As was shown above, Scotus does not subscribe to the Aristotelian  notion  of  the  necessity  of  the  present.  Nevertheless,  he  still holds that there is no power over the past. This leads him to a position on foreknowledge that bears striking similarities with the account known as Ockhamism in the foreknowledge debate. Very brie fl y,  according to this view, the fact that God foreknows that S will do A is  compatible with S 's power not to do A . If S actualizes this power and refrains from doing A at T , then he brings it about that God will have foreknown from all eternity that S does  not  do A at T .  On  the  traditional  Ockhamist  account,  God's foreknowledge is indeed a fected with pastness, but escapes its accidental f necessity by not being a fact really about the past (what recent commentators have labeled a 'hard fact'), since its content depends on what is yet\n\n$^{9}$^{8} De  scientia  Dei ,  ed.  Stegmüller,  228-29  especially  'nondum  adsit  tempus  futurum quod illi correspondeat.'\n\n$^{9}$^{9} See  ibid.  Craig  ( The  Problem  of  Divine  Foreknowledge , 172)  holds  to  the  same conclusion.\n\nfuture  and  thus  contingent. $^{1}$^{0}$^{0} The  Ockhamist  thus  holds  the  following claim:\n\n- (2) God has always known that S will do A at T and, until T ( T excluded), S can bring it about that God will always have known that S will not do A . $^{1}$^{0}$^{1}\n\nIf this thesis is combined with an account of knowledge based on divine decrees  and  the  thesis  of  the  necessity  of  the  present,  the  former  claim becomes equivalent to this:\n\n- (2') God decrees that S will do A at T , and, until T  T ( included), S can bring it about that God will always have decreed that S will not do A .\n\nThis latter claim corresponds exactly to Molina's exposition of the theory of concomitant decrees:\n\nfor they maintain that if, for instance, Peter, who let us assume, is going to sin at some moment of time, did not sin at that time (which he is capable of because of his freedom) then God would bring it about that He had never known that Peter was going to sin, but that instead He had always known from eternity that Peter was not going to sin ( Concordia , disp. 51, n. 1).\n\nMolina  objects  to  this  theory  on  the  ground  that  it  compromises  God's providence  and  predestination  and  entails  the  impossibility  of  genuine prophecies. $^{1}$^{0}$^{2} But  his  main  charge  is  that  any  version  of  the  theory  of concomitant  decrees  leads  to  a  denial  of  the  necessity  of  the  past,  and forces one to acknowledge some power over the past in God. $^{1}$^{0}$^{3} The latter\n\n$^{1}$^{0}$^{0} Ockham, Ord . I,  d.  38,  q.  un.,  OT  IV,  588:  'quando  talis  propositio  de  praesenti aequivalet  propositioni  de  futuro  vel  dependet  a  veritate  alicuius  futuri,  non  oportet quod propositioni verae de praesenti correspondeat necessaria de praeterito. Et ita est in prop  osito.'\n\n$^{1}$^{0}$^{2} Concordia , disp. 51, n. 19-20.\n\n$^{1}$^{0}$^{1} Ibid., OT IV, 586. Molina expresses the same view in De scientia Dei , ed. Stegmüller, 242: 'si ego pro mea libertate fecero hoc, Deus faciet se numquam scivisse nisi hoc, et si fecero oppositum, ut de facto possum, Deus faciet se numquam scivisse nisi oppositum.' Molina attributes the view to most scholastics and to many important Tridentine theologians, especially to Antonio de Cordoba and Andrés de Vega (see above, n. 000).\n\n$^{1}$^{0}$^{3} The inference from the (restricted) contingency of God's foreknowledge to a generalized  power  over  the  past  was  highlighted  in  the  14th  century  by  thinkers  like  Peter of  Ailly  and  earlier  by  Thomas  Bradwardine;  see  R.M.  Gaskin,  'Peter  of  Ailly  and  Other Fourteenth  Century  Thinkers  on  Divine  Power  and  the  Necessity  of  the  Past,' Archiv für die Geschichte der Philosophie 79 (1997): 273-91.\n\nis strictly impossible and we see that Molina grants a strong necessity to past states of a fairs. Its medieval label is necessity f per accidens :  once an event has occurred, it becomes contradictory to assume that it has not. $^{1}$^{0}$^{4} According to Molina, any theory along the lines of 2 or 2' entails the contingency of what is past. Suppose for instance that God decrees today that the world never existed: this would have the consequence that some past events did not occur, which is absurd. $^{1}$^{0}$^{5} This criticism of Ockhamism can be extended to the Scotist, eternalist, version of the theory of concomitant decrees. Even if one grants that God's present volitions never fade into the past,  and  therefore  remain  contingent,  they  nonetheless  have  real,  temporally  past  e fects. f $^{1}$^{0}$^{6} As  a  consequence,  while  on  the  one  hand  divine decrees  are  contingent  if  they  are  related  to  eternity  taken  as  a  whole, on the other hand they are accidentally necessary if they are referred to some portion of time. Once God's decision to create the world is actual, it becomes necessary at all later times that God has decided to create the world. $^{1}$^{0}$^{7} What emerges from this is that Molina is close to the Aristotelian picture of the relations of time and modality and distances himself from the consequences of the Scotist conception.\n\nThis becomes a highly disputed issue when one turns to the Molinist treatment  of  the  logical  problem  of  future  contingents.  Interpreters  are opposed on the question of whether Molina endorses or denies the Principle of Bivalence (PB) in the case of future contingent propositions. The fatalist  inference  discussed  by  Aristotle  in De  interpretatione ,  Chapter  9 (18a34-b25) starts from the premise that PB applies to all future contingent  propositions,  and  concludes  to  the  necessity  of  what  will  happen. One way of interpreting the argument is to see it as resting on the idea that if  some proposition is true, then there is a fact that corresponds to it, and facts are such that they are unpreventable. In the case of the past, we think  that  is  stocked  with  truths  and  this  is  the  reason  we  come  to believe that it is unpreventable or necessary. On the traditional interpretation, Aristotle would not deny the principle on which the fatalist inference  is  based,  but  instead  restrict  the  scope  of  PB.  The  fatalist  and  the Aristotelian share the idea that there is a strict match between truth (or\n\n$^{1}$^{0}$^{4} Concordia , disp. 51, n. 12 and Commentaria in primam D. Thomae partem , q. 25, a. 4, 354a-355b. See Craig, The Problem of Divine Foreknowledge , 186-87.\n\n$^{1}$^{0}$^{6} Molina's criticism anticipates C. Normore's remark that 'if what is genuinely past is what is past for us, this raises the very delicate issue of wether what is in our past is really necessary or not' ('Duns Scotus's Modal Theory,' 136).\n\n$^{1}$^{0}$^{5} Concordia , disp. 51, n. 14.\n\n$^{1}$^{0}$^{7} Concordia , disp. 51, n. 25; disp. 48, n. 21; De scientia Dei , ed. Stegmüller, 244-45.\n\nontological determinateness) and necessity. And Molina seems to accept the  same  conclusion. $^{1}$^{0}$^{8} But  Scotus's  conception  of  synchronic  contingency and God's will as a truth-maker for contingent propositions, at least as far as propositions on the present are considered, entails a possible gap between the two. $^{1}$^{0}$^{9} Conversely, Molina's criticisms of the theory of concomitant decrees seem to rest on a fundamentally Aristotelian intuition.\n\nWe have seen above that Molina ascribes deterministic consequences to Scotus's theory of the source of contingency. He comes to same conclusion as far as the latter's account of divine foreknowledge is considered. Scotus's position is summarized in the following way:\n\nhe claims that it is solely in the determination of His will that God knows which part of each contradiction is going to turn out to be contingently true in the future, and thus that it is solely in the free determination of His will that  He  knows  future  contingents  with  certainty  ( Concordia disp.  50,  n.  7, trans. Freddoso, 132).\n\nSuch a theory is  incompatible  with  libertarian  free  will. $^{1}$^{1}$^{0} Suppose  that S is  free  to  will A .  Then  it  must  be  able  to  refrain  from  willing A .  God decides to make ' S wills A ' true by bringing about the corresponding state of  a fairs.  But  this  seems  to  entail  that  either f S is  no  longer  able  not  to will A ,  or God's will would not su ffi ce to ground an infallible knowledge.\n\n$^{1}$^{0}$^{8} Concordia , disp. 52, n. 6, n. 15 and n. 37; Quaestio de futuris contingentibus, ed. Stegmüller, 9: 'si enuntiationes de futuro essent determinate verae, omnia evenirent necessario non solum necessitate consequentiae sed etiam consequentis.' In this passage, Molina does not reconstruct Aristotle's position but seems to give his responsio propria. Matters are complicated by the exact interpretation of the term 'determinate.' According to Craig ( The Problem of Divine Foreknowledge ) and Freddoso ('Introduction'), it means 'necessarily' and on their reading Molina does not restrict PB, but just tries to detect a fallacy in the fatalist  inference.  However,  it  is  more  likely  that  Molina  understands  'determinately'  as expressing the distribution of truth-values within a disjunction of contradictory sentences; see R.M. Gaskin, 'Molina on Divine Foreknowledge and the Principle of Bivalence,' Journal of the History of Philosophy 32 (1994): 551-71. A given sentence is determinately true if it is true and its contradictory is false. And it is indeterminately true i f it is indeterminately f false.  Such  a  reading  of  the  adverb  'determinate'  was  not  uncommon,  for  someone  like Peter Aureol in the 14th century, who explicitly denies that PB applies to future contingent propositions, simply equates determinate verum and verum . Cf. Scriptum super sententias I dist. 38, art. 3, ed. Schabel, Cahiers de l'institut du Moyen Âge Grec et Latin 65 (1995): 126.\n\n$^{1}$^{1}$^{0} De Scientia Dei , ed. Stegmüller, 238; Concordia , disp. 50, n. 7, n. 14.\n\n$^{1}$^{0}$^{9} For Scotus's hesitant claims about the determinacy of the future, see Lectura I, d. 39, n. 69, Vat. XVII, 502-03: 'sed in futuris non est determinatio talis: licet Deus determinate sciat a fore pro aliquo instanti, pro illo tamen potest scire a non fore'; Ord .  I,  d. 39, n. 26, Vat. VI, 432: 'talis autem non est determinatio ex parte futuri, quia licet alicui intellectui sit una pars vera determinate . . . non tamen ita quin in potestate causae est pro illo instanti ponere oppositum.'\n\nNow,  Molina  makes  up  a  possible,  compatibilist  answer  a  Scotist  could give: although 'God wills that S wills A and S does not will A '  expresses an impossible proposition ( in sensu composito ), yet it is possible in sensu diviso that S does not will A .  Molina is reluctant to countenance the pertinence of the distinction in such a case, because there are two types of conditional necessity of the form 'necessarily (if P ,  then Q ).'  If  the  antecedent P is such that if someone S has the power to bring it about that Q is not true, then S has the power to bring it about that P is not true either, we can consistently maintain both 'it is impossible that P and notQ ' and ' S has the power to make notQ true.' If, however, the truth of the antecedent is beyond the scope of S ,  then it should be denied that S has the power to make notQ true. $^{1}$^{1}$^{1}\n\nIn the Concordia , Molina introduces the theory of a thorough Thomist like Domingo Bañez (1528-1604) as a mere verbal variant of Scotus's own theory. $^{1}$^{1}$^{2} This  gives  him an occasion to discuss a problem which Scotus struggled with, as we saw above, namely, how an account of divine foreknowledge based on divine decrees avoids the pitfall of either making God the author of sin or rendering him uncertain about bad events. $^{1}$^{1}$^{3} Bañez's own answer introduces a clear asymmetry: God knows that S sins  when he refrains from willing that S acts righteously. But as we saw above, Scotus considered that this cannot provide a secure basis for God's infallible knowledge,  unless  one  claims  that  any  free  creature,  if  left  to  her  own resources, will inevitably sin. But this last concession entails the denial of free will and responsibility. The Thomist opponent of Molina is treated as an extreme version of Scotus's account of foreknowledge, which con fi rms that he interpreted the latter as a deterministic theory.\n\n$^{1}$^{1}$^{1} De scientia Dei ,  ed.  Stegmüller, 238; Concordia ,  disp.  50,  n.  9;  Molina's distinction is similar to the Anselmian distinction between necessitas antecedens and necessitas sequens . Cf.

As  this  aspect  of  his  thought  is  treated  elsewhere  in  the  volume,  I will  give  only  a  rough  sketch. $^{1}$^{1}$^{4} Molina's  central  innovation  consists  in the  introduction  of  middle  knowledge  ( scientia  media ) as  an  intermediary  stage  in  the  divisions  proposed  by  Scotus  and  Aquinas.  The  former distinguished God's natural knowledge of what is necessary and his free knowledge of contingent states of a fairs. Middle knowledge falls between f the natural and the free knowledge. Like Scotus, Molina describes God's natural knowledge as the knowledge, based on the contemplation of his own essence, of what is possible. $^{1}$^{1}$^{5} Natural knowledge and free knowledge are characterized exactly as Scotus did: the content of the former includes all  necessary  states  of  a fairs  and  lies  beyond  the  scope  of  God's  power. f God has free knowledge of what he decrees to create. It is free because (i)  it  could  have  a  di ferent  content  and  (ii)  such  a  change  depends  on f God's  will  ( Concordia ,  disp.  52,  n.  9).  Middle  knowledge  is  then  added to  this  dichotomy  in  order  to  save  creaturely  freedom  as  well  as  God's providence and predestination. According to Molina, God knows before any decision, not only what is possible under any hypothesis considered, but  also  what  creatures  would  do  in  any  situations,  in  particular,  what humans would freely do under such or such a hypothesis. $^{1}$^{1}$^{6} Through his middle  knowledge,  then,  God  knows  not  actual  future  contingents,  but what Molina calls conditional future contingents (FCCs):\n\nAll  contingent  states  of  a fairs  are,  I  repeat,  represented  to  God  naturally, f before any act or free determination of the divine will; and they are represented not only as being possible but also as being future-not absolutely future,  but  future  under  the  condition  and  on  the  hypothesis  that  God\n\n$^{1}$^{1}$^{4} Freddoso ('Introduction,'  46-62)  and  Craig  ( The Problem of Divine Foreknowledge , Chapter 7) provide valuable entries in Molina's version of the doctrine. For later developments within Jesuit theology, see S.K. Knebel, 'Scientia Media. Ein Diskursarchäologischer Leitfaden  durch  das  17.  Jahrhundert,' Archiv  für  Begri fsgeschichte f 34  (1991):  262-94.  For an introduction to middle knowledge discussions within contemporary philosophy of religion, see E. Dekker, Middle Knowledge (Leuwen: 2000).\n\n$^{1}$^{1}$^{6} Evidence for the reality of such a knowledge is given by the biblical story of David and Saul at Keilah (1 Sam. 23:10-12), and Jesus's lamentation at Chorazin and Bethsaida (Matt. 11:21).\n\n$^{1}$^{1}$^{5} De scientia Dei , ed. Stegmüller, 239; God's essence is the primary object of his knowledge; see Concordia , disp. 50, n. 16.\n\nshould decide to create this or that order of things and causes, with these or those circumstances ( Concordia , disp. 50, n. 15, trans. Freddoso, 140).\n\nThat is,  God  knows, under various hypothetical antecedents H ,  whether agent S would  freely  do A or  freely  refrain  from  doing A . Then,  if  he decides to create a world containing H ,  he knows that S will do A . $^{1}$^{1}$^{7} For instance, he knows that, if David stayed in Keilah, Saul would besiege the city,  while  there  is  no  incompatibility  between  David  staying  in  Keilah and Saul not besieging it.\n\nNow,  according  to  Scotus,  natural  and  free  knowledge  are  mutually exclusive  and  jointly  exhaustive,  since  the  root  of  contingency  must  be traced back to God's will. Thus the whole charge against the divine ideas account rested  on  the  claim  that  purely  conceptual  connections  escape the  will's  power  and  are  therefore  necessary. $^{1}$^{2}$^{1} Molina  turns  the  Scotist\n\nThe theory's central tenet is that the truth or falsity of any FCC escapes the control of God's will, and in this respect, middle knowledge is akin to natural knowledge: 'before any free determination of His will, by virtue of the depth of His natural knowledge . . . He discerns what the free choice of any creature would do by its own innate freedom' ( Concordia , disp. 49, n. 11, trans.  Freddoso,  119). $^{1}$^{1}$^{8} However,  FCCs  are  contingently  true,  because their truth depends on what creatures would freely do. $^{1}$^{1}$^{9} The content of middle  knowledge  is  such  that  though  it  escapes  God's  power  it  is  not essentially  so,  and  in  this  respect,  it  shares  common  features  with  free knowledge. $^{1}$^{2}$^{0}\n\n$^{1}$^{1}$^{7} Freddoso  uses  the  device  of  Creation  situations  in  his  presentation  of  Molinism. Intuitively,  the  idea  is  that  God  cannot  create  any  possible  worlds  he  pleases,  but  only those that are part of a Creation situation. As he writes ('Introduction,' 49): 'if God knows prevolitionally in CS w ( ) that Adam will sin if placed in H ,  then He cannot arrange things in such a way that Adam will be in H and yet not sin . . . Over this fact God has no control.' Of course, God may decide to create a world with a di ferent condition in which Adam f would not sin, but that would constitute another Creation situation.\n\n$^{1}$^{1}$^{9} Concordia , disp.  50,  n.  15,  Freddoso,  140-41;  disp.  52,  n.  9; De  scientia  Dei , ed. Stegmüller, 240.\n\n$^{1}$^{1}$^{8} Concordia , disp. 52, n. 10, trans. Freddoso, 168: 'such knowledge should in no way be called free, because it is prior to any act of God's will and also because it wat not within God's power to know through this type of knowledge anything other than what He in fact knew'; n. 12: '[God] knows through it middle knowledge, not freely, but quasi-naturally.'\n\n$^{1}$^{2}$^{0} Concordia ,  disp.  52,  n.  10,  Freddoso,  169:  'therefore  it  is  no  more  natural  for  God to know through this sort of knowledge one part of a contradiction than it is for Him to know the opposite part.'\n\n$^{1}$^{2}$^{1} In  addition to the references above, see the following passage: 'nullum subiectum continet nisi veritates necessarias de ipso, quia ad contingentes de ipso aequaliter se habet ex se et ad opposita' (Scotus, Ord . Prol. q. un., p. 3, n. 169, Vat. I, 112-13).\n\nargument on its back. Since the theory that God's will is the root of contingency  destroys  human  freedom,  the  only  way  to  save  the  latter  is  to claim that knowledge of what free creatures would do in various circumstances is prior to any actual decision on God's part. This, in turn, entails the  denial  of  the  Scotist  claim  that  the  extent  of  God's  will  settles  the limits of what is contingent. $^{1}$^{2}$^{2}\n\nThere are two further points within the theory of scientia  media that need some discussion. First, the theory requires a substantial use of the notion of possible worlds. As we have seen above, although there are elements in Scotus's thought which invite to ascribe him a possible worlds modal framework, nevertheless total states of a fairs or combinations of f unactualized possibilities into uni fi ed worlds do not have a speci fi c role, in part because the notion of compossibility alone does not provide enough resources to  de fi ne a whole possible world. But the main reason is that every contingently uni fi ed ordo rerum is a possible object for God's choice. Thus if it is  possible that the past history of the actual world be exactly as it is now, call it h , and some state of a fairs f s contingently obtains now, then the combination h &amp; not-s is another possible object of God's choice. But then it is indi ferent to say either that God actualizes a collection of f compossible states of a fairs or that he actualizes a complete f ordo rerum . Talk  of  possible  worlds  is  inessential  within  Scotus's  modal  framework. But things change once we say that some FCCs are true independently of God's  choice.  In  Molina,  expressions  like ordo, series  rerum, combinatio , or even mundus are not occasionally mentioned, but systematically used in order to describe complete sets of circumstances that are the object of divine choice. The following passage is especially striking:\n\nGod in  His  eternity  before  the  free  determination  of  His  will  to  create  or produce something, from the intuition of His essence and power, knew by a natural knowledge everything He could do, that He could create this world,\n\n$^{1}$^{2}$^{2} Concordia ,  disp.  50,  n.  15,  trans.  Freddoso,  140:  'and  so  we  disagree  with  Scotus, because  we  hold  that  the  explanation  for  God's  knowing  with  certainty  which  part  of any  contradiction  among  those  contingent  states  of  a fairs . . . is  going  to  obtain  it  not  a f determination of the divine will . . .' Molina's charge in disp. 53 against those who try to account for God's knowledge of FCC through his conditional decrees can be applied to the similar move a Scotist could do. The 17th-century Scotist, Bartolomeo Mastri (also known as Princeps scotistarum), advanced such a view of God's knowing FCCs through his actual decree that if it were that H ,  then S would do A .  Cf. Disputationes theologicae in I librum Sententiarum (Venice: 1684), d. 3, q. 4, a. 4, n. 256; 193b. For Mastri's overall position on the issues discussed here, see J.-P. Anfray, 'Prescience divine, décrets concomitants et liberté humaine d'après Bartholomeo Mastri,' in Saggi sul pensiero fi loso fi co di Bartolomeo Mastri (1602-1673) , ed. M. Forlivesi (Padova: 2006), 555-92.\n\n360\n\n## jean pascal anfray -\n\nand in fi nitely many others that he could create this one in this or that part of  time  or  any  other,  that  He  could  create  in  it  these  angels,  or  in fi nitely many others . . . that He could grant to each single man such or such a complexion, or not this one but another; and so on for the in fi nitely many other orders and combinations of things and circumstances that His omnipotence could do in this universe.\n\nOne should know in addition, that [God] in His eternity and before the determination of His will, by the same natural knowledge stemming from the absolute comprehension and penetration of the things and causes, saw what would be future if He chose to produce this or that order, what any angel, left  to  his  own  free  will,  would  do  by  his  innate  freedom  with  such and such helps and, given these or those occasions and circumstances, what any man . . . would do by his innate freedom, while he could nonetheless do the contrary if he willed so, and under the same set of circumstances, temptations and occasions ( De scientia Dei , Stegmüller, 239).\n\nIn the fi rst paragraph, Molina describes possible worlds as alternatives to God's choice. But the second paragraph shows that even if, for instance, a  world  where  Peter  does  not  deny  Christ  is  a  possible  world,  it  is  not an  object  for  God's  choice,  which  is  restrained  by  what  Peter  would  do under such circumstances. The truth of FCCs (of what some call conditionals of freedom) constitutes a barrier beyond which God's power does not extend. By giving such a prominence to the truth of FCCs over possible worlds, Molina might seem to downplay the idea of a possible world. But this is not so. If some state of a fairs f s depends on what a free creature would do, then God would no longer have a choice between actualizing  world w where h  &amp;  s obtain  and  actualizing  world w' where h  &amp; not-s obtain. Suppose it is true that if it were that h , then it would be that s ,  then  supposing  that  God  wants h to  obtain,  he  must  actualize s .  And since God acts according to an overall providential plan, if he wants some combination of circumstances to obtain, he must actualize all the FCCs that follow from them. This collection describes a unique set of states of a fairs,  and  makes  up  a  single  possible  world.  This  is  especially  imporf tant  to  account  for  the  realization  of  God's  providential  project.  Scotus sees it  as  a  sequential  process,  including  many distinct decrees, ordered according  to instantia  naturae :  thus fi rst  God  wills  the  principal  goal  of creation, namely the Incarnation of his son, and then he predestines some to glory, and fi nally he permits Adam's sin. $^{1}$^{2}$^{3} On the contrary, according to Molina, God knows what would happen in each ordo rerum considered as  a  complete  history  of  the  world  and  makes  a  single  uni fi ed  creation\n\n$^{1}$^{2}$^{3} Scotus, Ordinatio III, d. 7, q. 3, passim, in particular n. 67, Vat. IX, 288-89.\n\ndecree rationally grounded on his scientia media . $^{1}$^{2}$^{4} The end is therefore not  speci fi ed  independently  from  the  means  to  attain  it,  which  entails that, had Adam not sinned, God would not have incarnated himself.\n\nSecond,  from  an  epistemological  point  of  view,  Molina's  account  of middle  knowledge  can  be  seen  as  a  revised  version  of  the  divine  ideas account, as is con fi rmed by his explanation of the medium of God's middle knowledge:\n\nThus with Molina, the notions of asking what would happen in a given world, and thereby of truth in a world, become central. And thus far, the theory  of  middle  knowledge  is  an  important  step  between  the  Scotist notion of a possible logicum and the modern notion of a possible world. $^{1}$^{2}$^{5}\n\nIt  is  absolutely  true  that  the  ideas  (or  the  divine  essence  known  as  the primary object) are the fi rm and certain explanation for the fact that God, who comprehends in the deepest way both Himself and the things that He contains  eminently,  knows  future  contingents  ( Concordia ,  disp.  50,  n.  16, trans. Freddoso, 142).\n\nMolina grants that ideas are not su ffi cient to ground God's foreknowledge of actual future contingents, since a divine decree must be added. Nonetheless, ideas as intellectual representations prior to God's decrees are an appropriate characterization of the object of middle knowledge. $^{1}$^{2}$^{6} Such ideas  are  not  distinct  from  God's  essence,  because  following  orthodoxy, Molina claims that God's knowledge is not taken from things. $^{1}$^{2}$^{7} He  disagrees with those who ascribe to Scotus the idea that God knows things in their objective being understood as a divine production in an esse deminutum .  On  the  contrary,  he  rightly  ascribes  to  Scotus  the  view  that  God's essence  is  the  primary  object  of  his  cognition. $^{1}$^{2}$^{8} However,  he  departs\n\n$^{1}$^{2}$^{4} Commentaria , q. 23, a. 4-5, disp. 1, memb. 7, 313a: 'at ita, propter plenissimam deliberationem,  cognitionemve,  qua  futura  omnia,  ex  hypothesi  praevidebat,  meditandus  est elegisse simul totum ordinem illum.'\n\n$^{1}$^{2}$^{6} Concordia , disp. 50, n. 17-20.\n\n$^{1}$^{2}$^{5} See T. Ramelow, Gott, Freiheit, Weltenwahl, Der Ursprung des Begri fes der besten aller f möglichen Welten in der Metaphysik der Willensfreiheit zwischen Antonio Perez ( 1599-1649 ) und G.W.

Thomae partem ,  q.  14,  a.  5  and  6,  disp.  un  (Lyon: 1622), 154a.:  '[intellectus  divinus]  primo  fertur  in  suam  essentiam,  ut  in  obiectum  primarium, in  quo  virtute  continentur  naturae  aliarum  rerum,  et  mediante  essentia  ita  cognita  illo eodem intuitu cognoscit ac intuetur ulterius, ut obiectum secundarium, naturam cuiusque aliarum rerum propriam.'\n\n$^{1}$^{2}$^{8} Commentaria , ibid., 155a.\n\n362\n\nfrom Scotus and aligns with Aquinas, by claiming that ideas as such are not to be identi fi ed with the essences or natures of things, but are identical  with  God's  essence. $^{1}$^{2}$^{9} Molina  justi fi es  this  by  appeal  to  the  further claim  that  the  creatures'  essences  are  not  possible  through  themselves, but owe their possibility to God's power. $^{1}$^{3}$^{0} And this is clearly in opposition to the standard interpretation of Scotus. Moreover, the identi fi cation of  ideas  with  God's  essence  is  closely  connected  to  another  speci fi cally Molinist  claim,  namely  that  God's  knowledge  is  more  perfect  than  its objects,  or  more  precisely,  that,  in  virtue  of  God's  in fi nite  superiority  to the  known  objects,  something  can  be  epistemically  determinate  within God, in other words, God can be certain about it, even if it is metaphysically indeterminate. This property of God's knowledge is what Molina calls supercomprehensio . $^{1}$^{3}$^{1} Without  entering  into  the  intricacies  of  this  doctrine, what is clear is that it is close in spirit to the Neoplatonic thesis that what  is  known  has  the  character  of  the  knower,  so  that  a  most  perfect being can know what is indeterminate in itself. $^{1}$^{3}$^{2} Such an idea somehow comes to the surface in Thomas Aquinas's treatment of God's foreknowledge, when he claims that a thing's mode of being is not necessarily the same as its esse cognitum .  It  entails  that  knowledge with respect to God\n\n$^{1}$^{2}$^{9} Commentaria , q.  15,  a.  1,  disp.  2,  242a:  'comparatione  intellectus  divini  essentia divina propriissime habet rationem ideae creaturarum, et non ipsae naturae rerum. Haec est contra Scotum, Durandum, et reliquos . . .'\n\n$^{1}$^{3}$^{1} The fullest  account  of  the  doctrine  is  to  be  found  in Concordia ,  disp.  52,  n.  11-18. Molina says at n. 11 that 'in order to see which part a free being will turn itself toward . . . what is required is an absolutely profound and absolutely pre-eminent comprehension, such as is  found  only  in  God  with  respect  to  creatures.'  The  chiasm  between  an  object's  intrinsic knowability (its metaphysical determinateness) and the possibility that some in fi nite being be able to know it is clearly a ffi rmed ibid., n. 17: '[that] things that are knowable in the object by their very nature or because of their being, but it is not true of those things that are known in a way exceeding their nature solely because of the eminence and unlimited perfection of the knower.' Cf. Commentaria , q. 16, disp. 1, 246b: 'quia Deus non sumit talem cognitionem suam nec certitudinem illius a rebus ipsis contingenter futuris, quae in utramque partem possunt evenire, sed ex altissima comprehensione rerum ominum in sua essentia, ut in primario obiecto, atque ex in fi nita, omnique ex parte illimitata perfectione sui intellectus eam habet, inde est quo mensura veritatis illius scientiae nulla ratione sit obiectum secundarium, hoc est, essentia divina una cum libera determinatione voluntatis divinae.'  On  this,  see  Freddoso  'Introduction,'  50-53;  Craig, The Problem of Divine Foreknowledge , 179-83.\n\n$^{1}$^{3}$^{0} Commentaria , ibid.: 'exemplar igitur primum, in quo a Deo fi eri posse conspicitur . . . non est ipsamet natura humana habens rationem entis, sed essentia divina, in qua virtute continetur, et cuius potest esse participatio, eam suo modo imitando.'\n\n$^{1}$^{3}$^{2} See  in  particular  Boethius, Consolatio  philosophiae ,  V,  pr.  4,  l.  75-77,  000:  'omne enim  quod  cognoscitur  non  secundum  sui  vim,  sed  secundum  cognoscentium  potius compre  henditur  facultatem.'  To  characterize  this,  Hoenen  1993  (172)  contrasts  such  an epistemo  logical subjectivism with epistemological objectivism.\n\nand to creatures is at most an analogical concept, and in so far, Molina seems  to  share  Aquinas's  conception  of  the  divine  attributes. $^{1}$^{3}$^{3} And  in turn, this is clearly at odds with Scotus's metaphysics and rational theology,  the  starting  point  of  which  lies  in  the  univocity  of  the  concept  of being, of its attributes, and of other perfections. $^{1}$^{3}$^{4}\n\nXII\n\nWhat emerges from this study is that it is almost impossible to give a onesided appraisal of Molina's relation to Scotus. Both thinkers have a strong notion of metaphysical freedom, but they do not articulate it with exactly the  same  metaphysical  hindsight.  The  discussions  around  the  relation of  time  and  modality  and  about  the  grounds  of  knowledge  have  shown that  Molina  is  sometimes  closer  to  ancient  modal  and  cognitive  paradigms than it might have seemed at fi rst glance. However, no account of foreknowledge provides a prima facie so complete reconciliation of God's foreknowledge  with  a  libertarian  view  of  free  will  than  the  doctrine  of middle knowledge. And so, to close this study, we should ask if it is possible to cast some light on Scotus's theory through the lens of Molinism. As  we  saw  above,  some  passages  in  the  Subtle  Doctor  lend  themselves almost  naturally  to  a  quasi-Molinist  reading.  Thus,  in Ord .  II,  d.  34-37, Scotus seems to claim that there is a kind of dependency, more precisely a counterfactual dependency between a creature's free decision and God's decreeing its occurrence, such that, if  the creature had willed di ferently, f so  would  have  God.  Until  now,  this  dependency  has  been  understood along Ockhamist lines. But there might also be a Molinist interpretation if one adds that God knows what a creature would do before (in our way of conceiving) decreeing anything. And so, as Molina himself remarks in at least one place, Scotus's theory, if considered as incomplete, is not incompatible with the Molinist account:\n\nIf  therefore,  Scotus,  when  he  says  that  God  foreknows  future  contingents in the determination of His free will, conceives according to the sense that\n\n$^{1}$^{3}$^{3} See ST I,  q.  14,  a.  6,  ad.  1;  a.  13,  ad.  2.  On  the  analogy  of  divine  attributes,  see ST I, q. 13. See L.J. Elders, The Philosophical Theology of S. Thomas Aquinas (Leiden et al.: 1990). $^{1}$^{3}$^{4} Scotus, Ord .  I,  d.  3,  p.  1,  q.  1-2,  n.  26-55,  Vat.  III,  18-38.  On  the  univocity  of  the concept of being, see the studies in Part IV of Honnefelder et al., John Duns Scotus: Metaphysics  and  Ethics .  In  the  particular  case  of  divine  perfections  like  intelligence  or  will, Scotus claims that in fi nity does not destroy the formal nature of that to which it is added ( Ord . I, d. 8, q. 4, n. 17).\n\n364\n\n## jean pascal anfray -\n\nhas been explained, and that, assuming this natural knowledge by which He eternally  knew  all  future  contingents  in  their  future  being,  not  absolutely but  conditionally  such;  and  if  by  the  free  determination  of  His  will  [God] decided  to  create  this  or  that  order  of  things  with  these  or  those  circumstances, then what he says is true and agrees with ourselves ( De scientia Dei , Stegmüller, 240).\n\nMolina acknowledges that Scotus could be read as claiming that divine decrees provide a su ffi cient ground for God's knowing what will (unconditionally) exist, but that such a free knowledge is preceded by God's knowledge  of  FCC.  This  reading  was  not  uncommon  during  the  17th  century among Scotists. $^{1}$^{3}$^{5} And among recent scholars, those who hold a libertarian interpretation of his teaching on free will are led to ascribe a similar position to Scotus. In other words, in order to fi ll  the gap between God's knowledge  as  based  on  his  decrees  and  the  counterfactual  dependence of his decrees upon what a free creature would do under such and such circumstances, one would have to add something like middle knowledge to  Scotus's  account. $^{1}$^{3}$^{6} In  this  respect,  Molina's  innovations  can  help  to shed new light on the Subtle Doctor's thought.\n\n$^{1}$^{3}$^{5} Especially  important  'Molinist  Scotists'  are  John  Punch  and  Filippo  Fabri.  Cf. Filipppo  Fabri, Disputationes  theologicae (Venice:  1619),  I,  dist.  39,  dispute  53,  n.  22-23, 325b: '. . . contingentia provenire et a voluntate divina, et simul etiam a voluntate creata, quae est causa proxima . . .'; op. cit., disp. 54, n. 42, 337a: 'Molina et alii sentiunt ergo in re cum Scoto'; ibid., n. 50, 338b: 'ad salvandum libertatem nostrae voluntatis, et contingentiam in rebus su ffi cit quod decretum illud divinae voluntatis sequatur praevisionem, quid sit volitura mea voluntas.'\n\n$^{1}$^{3}$^{6} This  is  approximately  the  conclusion  reached  by  Dekker.  See  'Does  Scotus  Need Molina?' 109-10. In the end, however, he thinks that the theory of middle knowledge as a name for the process of God's cognition does not lead further than Scotus's own account in terms of decrees. The theory of middle knowledge only gives a fi ner explanation of the way of reconciling God's foreknowledge and created free will.",

Scotus and Molina both developed theories of free will and divine foreknowledge, but with important differences in their approaches and metaphysical foundations.\n\n2. For Scotus:\n- The will is the only truly rational power capable of self-determination\n- God's will is the ultimate root of all contingency\n- God knows future contingents through his own eternal decrees\n\n3. For Molina:\n- Free will requires the power to act otherwise even at the moment of choice\n- Created wills are independent sources of contingency alongside God's will\n- God has \"middle knowledge\" of what creatures would freely do in any circumstances\n\nKey Supporting Arguments:\n\nFor Scotus's view:\n- Only the will is undetermined to a single effect, unlike natural powers\n- God's eternal decrees remain contingent and could have been otherwise\n- Divine foreknowledge is based on God's own decrees about what will happen\n\nFor Molina's view:\n- Free will requires real power for opposites, not just logical possibility\n- God's concurrence with created causes does not determine their effects\n- Middle knowledge allows God to know future contingents without determining them\n\nKey Relations:\n\nSupport:\n- Molina builds on Scotus's theory of concurrent partial causes\n- Both emphasize libertarian free will against determinism\n- Both reject simple foreknowledge based on eternal presence\n\nAttack:\n- Molina argues Scotus's view makes God the only free cause\n- Molina rejects Scotus's claim that God's will is root of all contingency\n- Molina criticizes grounding foreknowledge solely in divine decrees\n\nThe core argumentative structure shows how Molina both builds on and critiques Scotus's framework while developing his own distinctive solution through middle knowledge.\n\nLet me know if you would like me to expand on any part of this analysis or extract additional argumentative elements from the text.",
