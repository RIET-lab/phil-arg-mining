Novotný\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nThe aim of this article is to draw interest to a period, or rather a certain philosophical culture, which has been neglected so far by standard historians of philosophy. Althought the authors of this period discussed many perennial philosophical  and  theologial  topics,  their  views  and  discussions  are  largely unstudied. The significance of these authors can be illustrated, for example, by the problem posed by nonexistent objects. Most contemporary discussions of this problem are inspired by the Austrian philosopher Alexius Meinong (18531920),  although  he  is  by  far  not  the  only  important  philosopher  of  the  past who  has  addressed  it.  For  the  problem  was  also  extensively  discussed  in medieval and post-medieval scholasticism, in the context of what were called 'beings of reason.' 1  Until recently Francisco Suárez (1548-1617) has been regarded  as  representing  the  climax  of  these  scholastic  discussions. 2   In  fact, however, Suárez stood at the beginning , rather than at the end , of an interesting and highly sophisticated philosophical culture, flourishing from 1597 (the year of the publication of Suárez's Metaphysical Disputations )  until  round 1700. This culture should best be called 'Baroque scholasticism.' Many more topics, besides beings of reason, could be mentioned as an illustration of important topics discussed by Baroque authors at the time, without their being adequately recognized  and  investigated  by  contemporary  historians  of  seventeenth-century  philosophy  (God's  existence  and  attributes,  transcendentals  and  categories, causality, intentionality, freedom and determinism, natural law, etc). Here\n\n1 See, for instance, John P. Doyle, 'Suárez on Beings of Reason and Truth', in: Vivarium 25 (1987), p. 47-75; and ibid. 26 (1988), p. 51-72, and Nicholas Rescher, 'Nonexistents Then and Now', in: Review of Metaphysics 57 (2003), p. 357-381. For a detailed study of beings of reason in Baroque scholasticism, see my Ph.D. thesis, 'Beings of Reason: A Study in Scholasticism of the Baroque Era' defended at the University of Buffalo in 2009 (it is electronically accessible through ProQuest/UMI Dissertation publishing). This article is a revision of the appendix of the thesis.\n\n2 See Ludger Oeing-Hanhoff, 'Gedankending ( ens rationis )', in: Historisches Wörterbuch der Philosophie Bd. 3 (G-H) ,  ed. Joachim Ritter (Basel, Stuttgart: Schwabe &amp; Co. Verlag, 1974), col. 55-62.\n\n## Daniel D. Novotný IN DEFENSE OF BAROQUE SCHOLASTICISM\n\nI offer  some  ideas  on  why  the  study  of  the  period  has  been  until  recently neglected and argue that more attention should be paid to it. 3\n\nIt is a known fact that the scholastic tradition flourished in the West in the medieval period, but in reality it continued well into the Renaissance and the Baroque. In the minds of many of our contemporaries, this period is linked with Platonism (Ficino, Pico della Mirandola) for the Renaissance and with the rationalists  (Descartes,  Spinoza,  Leibniz)  and  empiricists  (Locke,  Berkeley, Hume) for the Baroque. Yet, according to the estimate of Charles B. Schmitt, there  were  fewer  than  five  hundred  editions  of  Plato  before  1600,  whereas there  were  an  astonishing  three  to  four  thousand  editions  of  Aristotle. 4   The situation was no different in the seventeenth century, except for the growing influence  of  Descartes  and  British  empiricism  toward  its  end.  Thus,  in  the minds  of  historically  informed  philosophers,  the  sixteenth  and  seventeenth centuries should be linked with the overwhelming reality of scholastic philosophy and its predominant, although not exclusive, Aristotelian basis. Unfortunately, it is hard to detect this fact from today's standard historiography written in  English. With the exception of Suárez (and perhaps John of St. Thomas), seventeenth-century  scholasticism  seems  still  a  virtually  uncharted  territory. Maurice Grajewski said sixty years ago: 'Seventeenth century scholastic philosophy has suffered at the hands of historians. Not only is there a painful lack of histories of philosophy treating the Scholasticism of this period, but the few historians that mention it usually present an incomplete and distorted view'. 5 Unfortunately, these words are true today no less than they were then. Similarly,  Martin  Stone  points  out  in A Companion to  Early  Modern  Philosophy ,  that\n\n3 It needs to be said, however, that the interest in the period seems to be growing. Pereira, for example, has recently published two books manifesting the extent and value of Baroque philosophical and theological culture. See José Pereira: Suárez: Between Scholasticism and Modernity , Milwaukee,  WI:  Marquette  University  Press  2007;  and  José  Pereira  and  Robert  Fastiggi: The Mystical  Theology  of  the  Catholic  Reformation:  An  Overview  of  Baroque  Spirituality , Lanham, MA:  University  Press  of  America  2006.  Nevertheless,  the  most  extensive  surveys  by  Baroque philosophy were published more than fifty years ago in several German articles: Bernhard Jansen: 'Deutsche  Jesuiten-Philosophen  des  18.  Jahrhunderts  in  ihrer  Stellung  zur  neuzeitlichen  Naturauffassung', in: Zeitschrift für katholische Theologie 57 (1933), p. 384-410; 'Zur Philosophie der Scotisten des 17. Jahrhunderts', in: Franziskanische Studien 17 (1936), p. 25-58 (Part I), p. 150175 (Part  II);  'Quellenbeiträge  zur  Philosophie  im  Benediktineorden',  in: Zeitschrift  für  katholische Theologie 60 (1936), p. 55-98; 'Zur Phänomenologie der Philosophie der Thomisten des 17. und 18. Jahrhunderts', in: Scholastik 17 (1938), p. 49-71; 'Die scholastische Psychologie vom 16. bis 18 Jahrhundert', Scholastik 26 (1951), p. 342-63. These surveys are based on cursory reading of primary sources and are somewhat dismissive of the accomplishments of Baroque scholasticism. See also notes 7 and 27 below.\n\n5 Maurice Grajewski: 'John Ponce, Franciscan Scotist of the Seventeenth Century', in: Franciscan Studies 6 (1946), p. 54.\n\n4 See Charles B. Schmitt: Aristotle and the Renaissance , Cambridge, MA: Published for Oberlin College by Harvard University Press 1983, p. 14.\n\n## Daniel D. Novotný IN DEFENSE OF BAROQUE SCHOLASTICISM\n\n'we remain in a position of profound ignorance about what is referred to as Aristotelian  Scholasticism.  With  the  exception  of  a number  of  recent  studies that  have  sought  to  illuminate  the  thought  of  influential  thinkers  such  as Galileo, Descartes, Hobbes, and Leibniz, by considering the context in which they worked, the institutional philosophy of the period remains unstudied by contemporary historians of philosophy.' 6\n\nThis  article  is  divided  into  four  parts.  The  first  argues  that  seventeenthcentury scholasticism should be best labeled 'Baroque scholasticism' (I). The second presents a brief account of its emergence (II). The third argues that this period should be viewed as a sui generis chapter in the history of ideas (III). The fourth gives reasons for its investigation (IV).\n\nAlthough the article provides some information about Baroque scholastic culture, it is not intended to be a short history of Baroque scholasticism. The article offers only preliminary and general considerations of Baroque scholasticism, without treating in depth any particular Baroque author or topic. The same provisional character has the bibliography provided in the main text and in the footnotes; it by no means aspires to be exhaustive. Contemporary and future historians need to undertake many specialized studies in order to be able eventually to come up with a reliable and philosophically illuminating outline of the period. At the moment it is premature to attempt such an outline. 7\n\n6 Martin  W.  F.

Novotný\n\n## IN DEFENSE OF BAROQUE SCHOLASTICISM\n\nFinally, although in my opinion Baroque philosophical culture is valuable not just  for  historians  but  also  from  the  systematic  point  of  view,  this  claim  will not  be  substantiated  in  an  article  such  as  this,  which  deals  primarily  with historical considerations.\n\n## I. LABELS\n\nIn  the  seventeenth  century,  an  'alternative'  philosophical  culture  runs parallel to the well-known culture of so-called 'modern philosophy,' which is usually 'presented as a contest between two philosophies -Cartesian rationalism and British empiricism.' 8  This culture had its own agenda (which was, however, not entirely dissimilar to the agenda of 'modern philosophy'), a standard  set  of  assumptions,  and  its  own  technical  language  and  methods. Both in the Protestant and Catholic parts of Europe and the Americas, it was at home in universities, seminaries and other institutions of higher learning and it was 'the mainstream philosophy of the time.' The roots of this culture lie in the Middle Ages but many new elements had been integrated into it during the Renaissance. This culture reached its peak between 1630 and 1680 and it was still alive in the mid-eighteenth century, in the works of such authors as Luis de Losada (1681-1748). There are probably only two philosophers from this tradition whose names might be occasionally heard outside of the small circle of experts:  the  Spanish  Jesuit  Francisco  Suárez  and  the  Portuguese  Dominican John of St. Thomas (also known as João Poinsot). The two are paradigmatic representatives of this culture but by far not the only interesting ones.\n\nHistorians of philosophy use various labels to refer to this culture. Some of these labels, such as 'late medieval,' 'Renaissance,' 'early modern Aristotelianism/scholasticism,'  are  inaccurate,  whereas  others,  such  as  'Second  scholastic,'  'Counter-Reformation  philosophy,'  might  carry  unwelcome  connotations. 9  My suggestion is to call this culture Baroque scholasticism and take it to\n\nA Taxonomic Problem', Perspectives on Science 8 (2000), p. 186-191. The only overview of Baroque philosophy based on detailed in-depth topical investigations was published in Czech: Stanislav  Sousedík: Filosofie  v č eských  zemích  mezi  st ř edov ě kem  a  osvícenstvím , Praha:  Vyšehrad, 1997 (a German translation appeared recently: Philosophie der frühen Neuzeit in den böhmischen Ländern , Stuttgart  -  Bad  Cannstatt:  Frommann-Holzboog  2009).  It  covers,  however,  only philosophy in the Czech lands.\n\n9 For a list of labels in use, see also Marco Forlivesi, 'A Man, an Age, a Book,' in: 'Rem in seipsa cernere'. Saggi sul pensiero di Bartolomeo Mastri (1602-1673) , ed. Marco Forlivesi, Padova:\n\n8 See Richard Popkin: The Third Force in Seventeenth-Century Thought , Leiden - New York: E. J. Brill 1992, p. 90. Although Popkin has shown convincingly the inadequacy of the 'two-party view' of seventeenth-century philosophy (rationalism vs. empiricism) by identifying 'a third force' (a  combination of science, theosophy, and millenarianism) (pp. 91-119), he underestimates the sociological and intellectual importance of seventeenth-century scholasticism, which in fact might be called 'the first force.'\n\n## Daniel D. Novotný IN DEFENSE OF BAROQUE SCHOLASTICISM\n\nbe  the  successor  of Renaissance  scholasticism ,  both  being  phases  of Postmedieval scholasticism .\n\nLet me take up first the inaccurate labels. The main problem with the term 'late  medieval  scholasticism'  is  that,  in  spite  of  the  well-known  difficulties  in establishing the boundaries of the Middle Ages, it is too far-fetched to call any seventeenth-century philosophers 'medieval.' And to mean by 'medieval' merely  'being  inspired  by  medieval  thinking'  would  not  do,  for  many  contemporary thinkers, such as Norman Kretzmann or Peter Geach, would have to be turned into 'very late medievals' as well. Some have suggested that the distinguishing  feature  of  medieval  philosophers  is  their  concern  to  'measure  their philosophical  speculation  against  the  requirements  of  Christian  doctrine.' 10 This  will,  however,  turn  into  medieval  figures  not  just  Justin  Martyr  (midsecond century) and Suárez, who is anyway considered by some to be 'the last chapter in the history of medieval philosophy,' but even some contemporary thinkers such as Elisabeth Anscombe or Karol Wojty ł a. This would not make the term useful. 11\n\nWhat  about  the  terms  'early  modern'  and  'Renaissance'?  Historians  of philosophy commonly use 'modern' or 'early modern' for philosophers from Descartes  onward. 12   According  to  this  usage,  the  history  of  philosophy  between Antiquity and the Enlightenment is divided into medieval, Renaissance and  early  modern.  This  language,  however,  is  at  odds  with  the  practice  of general historians who mean by 'modern period' the times since the end of the Middle Ages. According to their convention, whatever the end of the Middle\n\nIl Poligrafo 2006, p. 106-110. Forlivesi himself prefers the label 'Academic philosophy'. This label is appropriate on its own but it does not delimit the period/culture chronologically. It is close in meaning to 'scholasticism' and if we adopt it we could speak of 'Renaissance' or 'Baroque Academic philosophy'.\n\n11 The vagueness of concepts applied to culture and its history is not surprising. Even though cultural periods do have a 'distinct physiognomy' (see Paul Oskar Kristeller: Renaissance Thought and Its  Sources ,  Columbia  University  Press  1979,  p.  17),  there  are  countless  respects  in  which a thinker of one culture may be compared to a thinker of another culture. What makes Augustine more similar to Aquinas than to Proclus? What makes Suárez more similar to Ockham than to Descartes?  One  could  find  countless  similarities  and  dissimilarities  and  it  is  futile  to  search  for  the single key property.\n\n10 Paul Vincent Spade: 'Medieval Philosophy,' in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2005 Edition) , ed. Edward Zalta, URL=  http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/medieval-philosophy/  .\n\n12 ' The modern period in the history of philosophy is conventionally supposed to begin in the seventeenth century, with the Novum Organon (1620) of Sir Francis Bacon (c.1561-1626) and the Discourse on the Method (1637) of René Descartes (1596-1650). Bacon and Descartes were not  isolated  thinkers,  and  their  writings  are  everywhere  influenced  by  the  work  of  their  predecessors and contemporaries. Nevertheless, it is not arbitrary to credit them with initiating modern philosophy, since between them they destroyed the assumptions, the methods, and the language which  had  been  the  common  property  of  philosophers  since  the  early  Middle  Ages. '  -  Roger Scruton: Modern Philosophy: An Introduction and Survey , London: Sinclair - Stevenson 1994).\n\n## Daniel D. Novotný IN DEFENSE OF BAROQUE SCHOLASTICISM\n\nAges is, the seventeenth century is by no means early modern times; rather it overlaps with what art historians call 'the Renaissance.' But suppose that we disregard  the  other  conventions  and  stick  to  the  practice  of  historians  of philosophy. Should we call the scholasticism of the seventeenth century, 'early modern' or 'Renaissance scholasticism'? The latter option has been more common. Frederick Copleston, for instance, deals with Suárez and a few post-Suarezian authors under the heading 'the Scholasticism of the Renaissance.' 13  The same is true of Charles H. Lohr, who published his bibliography of the Aristotelian  commentaries  from  1500  to  1650  under  the  title  'Renaissance  Latin Aristotle  Commentaries.'  Yet  Renaissance  scholasticism  is  supposed  to  end with  the  Renaissance,  doesn't  it? 14   Consequently,  it  is  somewhat  awkward  to say  that  Rodrigo  Arriaga  published  'a  Renaissance  scholastic  work'  (namely the newly revised Cursus philosophicus ) in 1666, almost fifteen years after Lorenzo  Bernini's The  Ecstasy  of  St  Theresa (1652)  and  more  than  sixty  years  after Claudio Monteverdi's Vespers for the Blessed Virgin (1610), paradigmatic works of Baroque art. It would have been hard for Renaissance scholastics to flourish in the midst of burgeoning Baroque architecture, sculpture, music, painting, literature, and drama. Moreover, 'Renaissance scholastic works,' such as Losada's three  volume Cursus  philosophicus ,  were  published  in  the  eighteenth  century (1724-1735) too. Hence, if we want to use the terminology of art history, we should adopt the term 'Baroque' and drop 'Renaissance.'\n\nBut let us go back to the term 'modern.' We need to distinguish a culturally-laden and a culturally-neutral meaning of the term. The latter designates a historical period which simply starts at a certain point in time. As mentioned above,  there  is  a  discrepancy  between  what  historians  in  general  and  what historians of philosophy take as the beginning of modern times but, whatever it  is,  Descartes  and  Bacon  are  modern  philosophers.  Hence  their  contemporaneous colleagues, such as Suárez or John of St. Thomas, must also be modern philosophers - in this culturally-neutral sense.\n\nIn  the  culturally-laden  sense  'modern'  designates  familiar  assumptions, goals, methods, and the terminology that has progressively gained importance\n\n13 See Frederick Copleston, A History of Philosophy. Vol. 3: Late Medieval and Renaissance Philosophy (Westminster, MD: The Newman Press, 1953).\n\n14 According  to  Kristeller  the  Renaissance  ends  by  sixteenth  hundred  (see Renaissance Thought and Its Sources, 18), according to Heinrich Kuhn ('Aristotelianism in the Renaissance,' in: Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2005 Edition), ed. Edward Zalta, URL=  http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2005/entries/aristotelianism-renaissance/  ) in 1648, and  according  to  Schmitt  (see Aristotle  and  the  Renaissance )  and  Lohr  (Charles  H.  Lohr, 'Metaphysics,'  in The  Cambridge  History  of  Renaissance  Philosophy ,  ed.  Charles  B.  Schmitt, Cambridge:  Cambridge  University  Press  1988,  p.  537-638)  by  the  middle  of  the  seventeenth century.\n\n## Daniel D. Novotný IN DEFENSE OF BAROQUE SCHOLASTICISM\n\nin Western history of philosophy. Modern philosophical culture in this sense has  a  certain  'physiognomy'  that  sets  it  apart  from  pre-modern  medieval philosophical culture. 15  Suárez and most of the seventeenth century scholastics ( pace Ferrater Mora as we shall see) do not belong to modern philosophy in this culturally-laden sense of 'modern.' For one thing, modern philosophy is epistemology-driven, whereas the standard seventeenth century scholasticism is metaphysics-driven. For another, modern philosophy is science-driven, whereas the standard seventeenth century scholasticism is theology-driven. I say 'standard' for it is a myth to consider seventeenth century scholasticism a philosophical monolith. There were even self-professed scholastics who combined scholasticism  with  Cartesianism,  such  as  the  French  Franciscan  Antoine  Le  Grand (1629-1699), or with Baconism, such as the Spanish Jesuit, working in Rome, Sebastian  Izquierdo  (1601-1681). 16   Such  'modern  scholastics'  or  'semi-modern scholastics' in the culturally-laden sense were perhaps a minority against the background of mainstream scholastic Aristotelians of the Baroque era, but they existed as well.\n\nAt this point one could object that 'scholasticism' implies Aristotelianism and so there cannot be such a thing as modern scholasticism in the culturally-laden sense of 'modern.' In other words, the objection would argue that if Le Grand and Izquierdo are moderns, they are no longer scholastics. So let us consider the  term  'scholasticism.'  As  in  the  case  of  'modern,'  one  should  distinguish various meanings. In a narrow sense, scholasticism is a philosophical method and a system of thought, rooted in Aristotle and Aquinas, with close ties to the\n\n15 Anthony Kenny, for instance, writes: ' The writings of the classical philosophers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in Europe form a continuous and coherent chapter in the history of  philosophy. Despite the many differences of doctrine between them, the major philosophers between the time of Descartes and the time of Kant address a broadly similar agenda by broadly similar  methods.  When  Descartes  wrote,  the  Aristotelian  tradition  had  come  to  the  end  of  the productive  development  of  the  Middle  Ages;  after  Kant's  death,  European  history  began  to fragment  into  schools  that  barely  communicated  with  each  other.  But  in  the  period  between Descartes and Kant the differences between 'empiricist' philosophers in Britain and 'rationalist' philosophers  on  the  Continent  were  minor  in  comparison  to  their  shared  presuppositions  and goals. ' -The Oxford Illustrated History of Western Philosophy ,  Oxford: Oxford University Press 1994, p. 107. Kenny is right in claiming that modern philosophy has a certain kind of Gestalt ; however, it is a mistake, as we shall see, to say that ' when Descartes wrote, the Aristotelian tradition had come to the end of productive development. '\n\n16 There were also other sorts of scholastics. For instance, the Italian Capuchin Valerian Magni (1586-1661) considered himself an anti-Aristotelian follower of Augustine and Bonaventure, while at the same time he applied modern experimental methods. Magni was the first to publish the discovery of the vacuum - independently of Toricelli; he was also interested in Galileo's works. See Stanislav Sousedík: Valerián Magni: Kapitola z kulturních dejin Č ech 17. století , Praha: Vyšehrad 1983; S. Sousedík: Philosophie de frühen Neuzeit, pp. 114-139.\n\n## Daniel D. Novotný IN DEFENSE OF BAROQUE SCHOLASTICISM\n\nCatholic Church of the Latin West. 17  In this historically-laden sense, someone may wish to disqualify Le Grand, Izquierdo, and others from being scholastics, for,  in  spite  of  their  impeccable  Catholic  credentials,  they  were  not  faithful Aristotelians. There is, however, a broader sense, according to which scholasticism is any professional institutionally-based philosophical culture  which  is  characterized, at least in times of health, by comprehensiveness, team-work, rigor, systematicity, and friendliness to an organized religion. 18  Le Grand, Izquierdo, and many others were clearly scholastics in this broader sense. 19   This means that the scholastic culture taken in its broader sense should not be called Aristotelianism , because this downplays the significant role of Plato, and later of Descartes  and  Bacon,  for  some  philosophers within this  culture.  It  is  true  that Aristotle  plays by  far the  greatest  role  for  these  philosophers,  but  to  be  an Aristotelian requires a more sincere commitment to Aristotle's views than just 'taking Aristotle into account.' 20\n\nThe  meaning  and  usefulness  of  the  term  'Counter-Reformation  philosophy,' has been explored by José Ferrater Mora in 'Suárez and the Modern Philosophy.' 21  He asks, whether there is such a thing as modern philosophy in opposition to Counter-Reformation philosophy. While there may be differences in stress between the two traditions, such as the attempt to start from scratch vs.  rootedness  in  tradition,  or  this-worldliness  vs.  the  existential  priority  of Christian faith, there are also fundamental similarities:\n\n17 According to Merriam-Webster's Dictionary, 'scholasticism' is a word which appeared in English round 1782 and means 'a philosophical movement dominant in western Christian civilization from the 9th until 17th century and combining religious dogma with the mystical and intuitional tradition of patristic theology, especially of St. Augustine and later with Aristotelianism.' The related noun 'scholastic' appears in 1644, the adjective in 1596. These words came into English from the Latin doctores scholastici which, since the ninth century, applied it to those who taught the seven liberal arts or theology. The Latin word comes ultimately from the Greek ' σχολάζειν ', which means 'to have leisure for something (such as study)'.\n\n19 In  the  broader sense one may apply the term 'scholasticism' even beyond the context of Western Catholicism to Protestantism (see Willem J. van Asselt and Eef Dekker: Reformation and Scholasticism: An Ecumenical Enterprise , Baker Academic 2001) and in fact even to other religious traditions (see José Ignacio Cabezón, Scholasticism: Cross-Cultural and Comparative Perspectives , State University of New York Press 1998). Thus we may speak of varieties of scholasticisms, such Catholic, Lutheran, Calvinist, Byzantine-Orthodox, Buddhist, medieval, Renaissance, Baroque, and modern, among others.\n\n18 Timothy B. Noone lists three 'overarching traits' of scholastic thinkers: rigorous argumentation ( ratio ),  dialogue with Aristotle and other predecessors ( auctoritas ),  and the coordination of philosophy with faith ( concordia ) -'Scholasticism' , A Companion to Philosophy in the Middle Ages , eds. Jorge J. Gracia and Timothy B. Noone, Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing 2003, pp. 55-64.\n\n20 For  the  recent  debate  concerning  this  point  see  Forlivesi:  'A  Man,  an  Age,  a  Book',  pp. 102-106.\n\n21 See José Ferrater Mora: 'Suárez and the modern philosophy', in: Journal of the History of Ideas 14 (1953), pp. 528-547.\n\n## Daniel D. Novotný IN DEFENSE OF BAROQUE SCHOLASTICISM\n\nThe interest in philosophy, and in philosophy capable of affording a complete explanation  of  the  world  and  of  the  human  person  in  rational  terms,  is common alike to modern philosophy, to Protestants since Melanchthon, and to the so-called Counter-Reformation philosophers. 22\n\nFerrater  Mora  suggests  that  'Counter-Reformation  philosophers  are to  a certain  extent 'modern'  philosophers'  and  so  their  scholasticism  is  something that belongs to the 'modern spirit.' Without explicitly acknowledging this fact, Ferrater Mora continues, we cannot explain why the paradigmatic philosophers of modernity, such as Descartes or Leibniz, take seriously the scholasticism of the time, and why only a few years after the antischolastic flames of the Reformation the scholasticism à la Suárez became unprecedentedly popular all over Europe, including the Protestant countries:\n\n[T]he outstanding importance of Suárez was really due to the fact that he was the  first  to  erect  a  systematic  body  of  consistent  metaphysics  at  a  time  when people seemed to want something more than a series of Aristotelian commentaries,  or  than  a  rhetorical  philosophy  like  Peter  Ramus's,  or  even  than a vague skeptical philosophy. 23\n\nNow  it  cannot  be  denied  that  Suárez,  John  of  St.  Thomas  and  others qualify  as  'Counter-Reformation  philosophers.'  Nevertheless,  this  term  gives an impression that these thinkers reacted against the Reformation. And although it is true that they wrote occasional polemical works against one aspect of the Reformation or another, their main philosophical works, such as Suárez's Metaphysical Disputations ,  have nothing to do with the Reformation; in fact most of these works were equally regarded in both Protestant and Catholic countries. Furthermore, the term 'Counter-Reformation philosophy' undermines the very thesis  Ferrater  Mora  himself  defends,  namely  that  the  philosophy  of  Suárez and the likes is almost as modern as the philosophy of Descartes and the likes. (I disagree here with Ferrater Mora, so I am not worried about this point, but Ferrater Mora should have been.)\n\nFinally, we come to the term 'Second scholastic.' This term was proposed by the Italian confrere of Suárez, Carlo Giacon. 24  The term originally seems to presuppose the Thomistic picture, according to which the history of scholasticism can be divided into the First scholastic (the Golden Age) in the thirteenth century,  reaching  its  apex  in  Aquinas  and  starting  its  decline  in  Scotus  and\n\n22 Ferrater Mora: 'Suárez and the modern philosophy', p. 531.\n\n24 See  Carlo  Giacon, La  seconda  scolastica , Milan:  Fratelli  Bocca  1946.  This  three-volume pioneer work has been recently republished (Torino: Nino Aragno Editore 2001).\n\n23 Ibid.\n\n## Daniel D. Novotný IN DEFENSE OF BAROQUE SCHOLASTICISM\n\nOckham,  and  the Second  scholastic (the  Silver  Age)  in  the  sixteenth  century, reaching its apex in Suárez (counted a fellow Thomist for the purposes) and starting its decline under the influence of Descartes and Bacon. 25  I am somewhat skeptical about this picture, for scholasticism seems to be a multifaceted continuous movement with various peaks and dips for various 'schools' and regions. A Thomistic decline may coincide with a Nominalistic revival, or vice versa. A decline in one country may coincide with a revival in another. On the other hand, the Black Death in the mid-fourteenth century does seem to be a significant blow to the thriving scholastic culture, and mid-sixteenth century Spain  does  seem  to  be  the  beginning  of  the  spectacular  scholastic  revival (lasting, as I would say, at least until the 1680s). Thus, although I do not share the common preference for Aquinas over other scholastic authors, the intuitions about the Golden and Silver Ages might prove to be roughly correct in the end. If we avoid a priori Thomistic criteria of evaluation, the term 'Second scholastic' may be a good term for the entire period of postmedieval scholasticism (hence its meaning is broader than 'Baroque scholasticism'). 26\n\nAt this point an objection might be raised that I merely indulge in tedious verbalism  here.  My  answer  is  that  labels  have  power.  If  something  is  called 'middle age' and lies in between 'classical age' and 'revival age,' then only a few will spend their time investigating it. Similarly, if something is called 'Renaissance scholasticism,' the humanist criteria of evaluation tend to be applied (and if something fails to satisfy such criteria, it is bad for the something). Again, if we label some period 'late medieval' and a chapter on it appears in a book with the  subtitle  'From  the  Rediscovery  of  Aristotle  to  the  Disintegration  of Scholasticism,  1100-1600,'  we  will  probably  not  spend  much  time  to  read anything later than Suárez's Metaphysical Disputations. A good and accurate label is needed in order to motivate and facilitate unbiased and thorough research. 27\n\n25 One speaks also of the Third scholastic at  the  turn  of  the  last  century.  By  far,  the  Third scholastic does not reach the qualities of the Second, let alone the First scholastic. However, besides many insignificant authors of the Third scholastic, there are also some that stand out, such as Joannes  Josephus  Urráburu: Institutiones  philosophicae ,  8  vols.,  Vallisoleti  1908,  and  Josephus Gredt: Elementa  philosophiae  aristotelico-thomisticae : 13.  ed.  recognita  et  aucta  ab  Eucharius Zenzen, 2 vols., Barcelona: Herder 1899/1961.\n\n27 See  also  Lüthy,  'What  To  Do  With  Seventeenth-Century  Natural  Philosophy?'  Forlivesi ('A Man, an Age, a Book', p. 48-98) offers the best synthesis and evaluation of what has been reached in this field so far. Standard historians of philosophy, however, such as Kenny (see Oxford Illustrated  History ),  persist  in  dividing  the  history  of  Western  philosophy  between  Socrates  and Kant into Ancient, Medieval, and Modern; hence the Renaissance and Baroque scholasticism are left out from this division. Only a few historians do not neglect this period when taking up a study\n\n26 The complexity of the development of scholasticism from the fourteenth to the seventeenth century  is  shown  by  Forlivesi:  'A  Man,  an  Age,  a  Book',  pp.  48-98.  Forlivesi  rejects  the  term 'Second scholastic' for similar reasons as I do.\n\n## Daniel D. Novotný IN DEFENSE OF BAROQUE SCHOLASTICISM\n\n## II. EMERGENCE\n\nIt  is  not  uncommon  to  speak  of  Renaissance  scholasticism  as  a philosophical movement coinciding with what is generally called Renaissance art. Why is it then that almost nobody speaks of Baroque scholasticism during the time in which Baroque art flourished? 28  There are at least three reasons. First, the term  has  bad  connotations.  As  Merriam-Webster  puts  it,  the  Baroque  is 'a style characterized by grotesqueness, extravagance, complexity, or flamboyance.' Hence those who are sympathetic to authors such as Suárez or John of St. Thomas out of respect do not call them 'Baroque.' Second, it is generally assumed that scholasticism died with Suárez so that, properly speaking, there is no  scholastic  philosophy  after  him  -  the  Baroque  era  has  art  but  no  philosophy. Third, the few who do acknowledge the existence of the scholastic tradition  in  the  Baroque  era  assume  that  it  had  no  'distinct  physiognomy'  scholasticism  lived  in  the  Baroque  but  only  in  the  thoughtlessly  conserved facade inherited from a glorious past.\n\nThis article does not address these three reasons in general, for such task would have been too large. It simply aims to indicate that (1) what seems to be 'extravagant  complexity'  is  rather  an  admirable  accomplishment  required  by the  difficulty  of  the  problems  involved,  (2)  there  is  nothing  wrong  in  being 'Baroque'  (similarly  as  in  art  we  do  not  take  this  term  to  be  derogatory  any more), and (3) scholasticism after Suárez has features that justify distinguishing the Renaissance and Baroque phases of postmedieval scholasticism.\n\nI discuss the differences between Renaissance and Baroque scholasticisms in  the  next  section.  Let  me  now  turn  to  some  similarities  between  them.\n\nof the history of a particular problem: Wilhelm Risse: Die Logik der Neuzeit , vol II.

Anthony J. Cernera and Oliver J. Morgan, Fairfield: Sacred Heart University Press 2000. As far as I know the term was first coined by Eschweiler ('Die Philosophie der spanischen Spätscholastik',  p.  307).  Forlivesi  ('A  Man,  an  Age,  a  Book',  p.  112-114)  also  seems  to  be sympathetic to it, although he rather uses the term 'Academic philosophy'.\n\n## Daniel D. Novotný IN DEFENSE OF BAROQUE SCHOLASTICISM\n\nA major transformation of the scholastic tradition occurred in the Renaissance, so  that  both  Renaissance  and  Baroque  scholasticisms  resemble  each  other more than they resemble medieval scholasticism.\n\nIn a very simplified way, one could argue that the Renaissance revival of scholasticism was initiated by Dominicans and transformed into the Baroque by Jesuits, with the addition of the strong voice of Franciscans later on. Dominicans  were  committed  to  Aquinas,  Jesuits  had  nominalistic  and  empiricist tendencies, and Franciscans were committed to Scotus.\n\nThe Dominican initiators of the Renaissance revival of scholasticism were first French and Italian, then German and Hispanic. The latter played the major role in the formation of Baroque scholasticism. 29  This was quite opportune, for Spain was in its Golden Age and its cultural and political power spread from Bohemia to Peru. Spanish culture became relatively isolated from the 'disturbing' influence of anti-Christian humanism, Reformation, and skepticism, and this isolation, together with good economic conditions and the commitment of both the elite and ordinary people to Catholicism created an excellent niche for scholastic philosophy. 30  The important figure in the formation of Renaissance scholasticism  in  Spain  was  Francisco  de  Vitoria  (1492-1546),  a  charismatic teacher, deeply influential in spite of the fact that he published very little during his lifetime. 31  Vitoria studied at the University of Paris, which was predominantly nominalist. He creatively enriched his Thomistic synthesis with elements of nominalism and humanism without compromising the fundamental Thomistic tenets. Today he is known primarily for his landmark work on the ethics of war, but the case could be made that his circle also prepared the way for modern economics. 32  Vitoria had several outstanding Dominican students and\n\n29 I am grateful to an anonymous reviewer for pointing out to me the importance of non-Hispanic initiators of the Dominican revival of Thomism, such as Hervaeus Natalis (1260-1323), Johannes Caprelus (d. 1444), and Peter Crockaert  (1465-1514) in France, Dominicus de Flandria (ca. 1425-1479), Chrisostomus Javellus (ca. 1470-1538) , and Tommaso de Vio, known as Cajetan (1469-1534), in Italy, and Petrus Nigri (1434-1483) in Germany.\n\n31 See  Gregory  M.  Reichberg:  ' De  Indis  and  De  Iure  belli  relectiones (1557):  Philosophy Meets War', in: The Classics of Western Philosophy, eds. Jorge J. E. Gracia, Gregory M. Reichberg and Bernard N. Schumacher, Malden, MA: Blackwell 2003, pp. 197-203.\n\n30 See Jorge J. E. Gracia: Hispanic/Latino Identity: A Philosophical Perspective , Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishers 2000, p. 70-87. By 'anti-Christian humanism' I mean a certain kind of humanism, not that humanism as such is anti-Christian. As Kristeller has shown, humanism as such is not a philosophical but a cultural movement oriented toward the study of literature, languages, moral thought, and oratory, inspired by the models provided by the Ancients (See Paul Oskar Kristeller: Renaissance  Thought:  The  Classic,  Scholastic,  and  Humanistic  Strains,  A  revised  and enlarged  edition  of  \"The  Classics  and  Renaissance  Thought\" ,  New  York:  Harper  and  Brothers 1955/1961).\n\n32 See  Murray  N.  Rothbard,  'New  Light  on  the  Prehistory  of  the  Austrian  School',  in: The Foundations of Modern Austrian Economics , ed. Edwin Dolan, Kansas City: Sheed and Ward 1976.\n\n## Daniel D. Novotný IN DEFENSE OF BAROQUE SCHOLASTICISM\n\ncolleagues that spread their version of intellectually vigorous scholasticism from their basis in Salamanca to other places within the reach of Hispanic power. 33\n\nA  major  event  of  the  sixteenth  century,  which  in  fact  contributed  to  its transformation into the Baroque, was the foundation of the Society of Jesus in 1534, by the Basque soldier Ignatius of Loyola (1491-1556). One of the greaest cultural  forces  of  the  sixteenth  and  seventeenth  centuries  quickly  developed from his original group of six companions. The Jesuit activity had two priorities:  missions  and  education.  By  the  time  of  Ignatius's  death,  there  were already seventy-four Jesuit colleges in Europe and the Americas, with growing missionary,  scientific  and  intellectual  networks  in  Asia. 34   Due  to  the  tireless work of  the  Jesuits,  an  ingenious  blend  of  medieval  systematic  thought,  humanist scholarship, natural science, mathematics and technology spread from Europe  to  the  Americas  and  Asia.  The  Jesuits  were  by  no  means  the  only actors in this drama, but they were clearly one of its main intellectual motors. The two major Jesuit philosophers of the sixteenth century were the Spanish Francisco  Toledo  (1532-1596)  who  wrote  many  commentaries  on  Aristotle, such as De anima , and Pedro da Fonseca (1528-1599), dubbed 'the Portuguese Aristotle'  who  wrote  innumerably  reprinted Elementary  Dialectics  (Institutionum Dialecticarum) (1564) and Commentary on Aristotle's Metaphysics (1577). The latter is a beautifully done work which includes not just the Greek text, a Latin translation,  and  detailed  exegetical  discussions,  but  also  systematic  treatments  of topics  inspired  by  the  Aristotle's  work,  going,  however,  well  beyond  it.  In a sense,  Fonseca's  commentary stands even today as a model of good philosophy done historically. 35  Fonseca also supervised the writing and the publication of the Coimbra Commentaries on Aristotle (five quarto volumes first published\n\n33 For  instance:  Domingo  de  Soto  (1494-1560) advanced the Thomistic synthesis by  commenting on several works that Aquinas did not ( Summulae of Peter of Spain, Porphyry's Isagoge , Aristotle's Categories ). In his commentary on Aristotle's Physics , Soto anticipated Galileo's discovery of the uniform acceleration of material objects. Domingo Bañez (1528-1604), known today mainly for his involvement in the controversy over grace and freedom, published some outstanding commentaries on Aquinas's Summa . Diego Más (1553-1608) composed a systematic work in metaphysics ten years before that of Suárez. It is not as comprehensive and influential as Suárez's Metaphysical Disputations , but strictly speaking it is Más who could be credited with publishing 'the first large treatise on metaphysics composed in the West that is not a commentary on Aristotle's Metaphysics . ' The list of brilliant Spanish Dominicans could go on.\n\n35 See Jorge J. E. Gracia: Philosophy and Its History: Issues in Philosophical Historiography , Albany, NY: SUNY Press 1992.\n\n34 Among other things, the Jesuits were the founders of Chinese-Western comparative philosophy.  Prosper  Intorcetta  (1625-1696)  and  his  team  translated  the  classical  works  attributed  to Confucius into Latin in 1687, while Martino Martini (1614-1661) translated Suárez's Metaphysical Disputations into Chinese (the translation remains unpublished). Various studies of Chinese philosophy were published, for instance, by François Noël (1651-1729). See Josef Kolmaš: 'François Noël (Franciscus Natalis): Philosophica Sinica',´in: Fragmenta Ioanna Collecta 8, 2008, pp. 41-70.\n\n## Daniel D. Novotný IN DEFENSE OF BAROQUE SCHOLASTICISM\n\nbetween 1591 and 1606). The Jesuits were influential not only due to a number of  great  personalities,  but  institutionally  as  well:  in  1599,  they  published The Official Plan for Jesuit Education (Ratio atque Institutio Studiorum Societatis Iesu) which was a product of eighteen years of labor, debates and experimentation. This plan gave an institutionally-codified position to philosophy as an autonomous discipline for the first time since antiquity.\n\nThe Scotistic school of the Franciscans underwent a great revival later, since the beginning of the seventeenth century. The landmark event for them was the first splendid edition of Scotus's Opera omnia in 1639. The first students of Scotus were  heterogeneously-minded  thinkers:  some  tried  to  follow  Scotus  strictly, others, such as the French Franciscus Mayronis (d. 1325) or the Italian Nicholas Bonetus (d. 1344), only loosely. The Scotistic school in the narrower sense of involving an agreement on some fundamental doctrinal and methodological points emerges only during the fifteenth century. The two peaks of Scotism come round 1500 (e.g. Antonio Trombetta, d. 1517) and then in 1650. With a few exceptions, all major Scotists were members of the Franciscan Order, in particular the Conventuals, which was the parent stem founded by St. Francis in 1209, and the Observants, constituted in 1517. The Capuchins, constituted in 1619, were not very active as scholars and did not adopt Scotus, but Bonaventure, as their Master. The influence of Scotism, however, extends far beyond the Franciscan family, and some argue that it is the dominant force in seventeenth-century scholasticism. 36\n\nFor  the  most  part,  Baroque  scholasticism  had  a  Catholic  and  Hispanic character. Nevertheless, in German Protestant countries there was a revival of scholasticism too, starting with the work of Cornelius Martini (1568-1621) in Lutheran universities and Clemens Timpler (1567/8-1624) in Reformed institutions. Cornelius Martini published his Metaphysica commentatio in 1605, Clemens Timpler his Metaphysicae systema methodicum in 1604. It seems that Baroque Protestant  scholasticism  emerged  independently  of  Suárez,  since  the Metaphysical Disputations became  known  in  Germany  only  in  the  Mainz  edition  (1600). Timpler explicitly points out 37  that he could take Suárez into account only too late in writing his book.\n\n36 See Jansen: 'Zur Philosophie der Scotisten'; Grajewski: 'John Ponce'; and Felix Bak: 'Scoti schola numerosior omnibus aliis simul sumptibus', in: Franciscan studies 16 (1956): 144-165. See also Jacob Schmutz: 'L'héritage des Subtils, Cartographie du scotisme de l'age classique', in: Les Études Philosophiques (2002), pp. 51-81. The influence of Scotism on Descartes was noticed by Roger Ariew: Descartes and the Last Scholastics , Ithaca - London: Cornell University Press 1999, pp.  39-57.  It  is,  however,  dubious  that  there  was  any direct Scotistic  influence  on  Descartes. Scotistic ideas influenced non-scholastic authors indirectly via the Jesuits, see e.g. David Clemenson, Descartes' Theory of Ideas , Continuum 2007, 7-14.\n\n37 C. Martini also published independently of Timpler. This suggests an interesting question: What brought about the remarkable interest in systematic metaphysics in three confessional groups\n\n## Daniel D. Novotný IN DEFENSE OF BAROQUE SCHOLASTICISM\n\nAs pointed out earlier, Baroque scholasticism recognized the autonomy of philosophy, but it was predominantly 'theology-driven.' This means that it still saw theology as the discipline  of  the  highest  authority  and  the  object  of  the final  ambition  for  the  most  talented.  Hence,  even  though  philosophical arguments were never compromised by theological intrusions, the selection of philosophical  problems  was  motivated  primarily  by  their  applications  in  theology. Beside  this  theological  scholasticism,  there  was  also  scholasticism  driven  by mathematics,  science,  and  technology,  especially  in  Jesuit  Colleges,  but  this type  of  scholasticism  is  more  practical  than  speculative. 38   Interestingly,  for a long time, the 'standard' theologically oriented scholastics were biased against their scientific colleagues - the work of the latter was considered unscientific. Mathematics was looked down upon in that it did not involve syllogisms but 'imagination' and only syllogisms were believed to constitute real proofs. The crucial  person  in  dispelling  some  of  the  bias  against  mathematics,  at  least among the Jesuits,  was  the  German  Christopher  Clavius  (1538-1612),  called 'the Euclid of his Century.' 39  For many years, the mathematical and conceptual-theological tradition within the Jesuit order lived side by side, sometimes without much interaction. 40  In the latter part of the seventeenth century some Jesuits, such as Giovanni Battista Tolomei (1653-1726), who was probably inspired by Juan Caramuel y Lobkowitz (1606-1682), began to apply mathematical methods to philosophical and theological problems. 41\n\nat around the same time? The emergence of Protestant scholasticism independently from Suárez is defended by Wundt, Die deutsche Schulmetaphysik ,  against  Eschweiler, 'Die Philosophie der spanischen Spätscholastik'. See also Lewalter: Spanisch-Jesuitische und Deutsch-Lutherische Metaphysik .\n\n39 See James M. Lattis: Between Copernicus and Galileo: Christoph Clavius and the Collapse of Ptolemaic Cosmology , Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press 1995.\n\n38 The Jesuits made many significant contributions to astronomic observation, instrument construction,  measurement, calendar  theory, timekeeping, calculation, geography, mathematics, linguistics, and so on. In general, however, the Jesuits did not do research in medicine and biology, although some other scholastic authors did. An instance is Joannes Marcus Marci (1595-1667), one of the most important Catholic intellectuals  in seventeenth-century Bohemia. Marci died as a Jesuit but he spent his life as a married layman. After 1620 he became a professor of medicine in Prague. Apart from medicine and biology, he published works in physics, philosophy and theology. See Ivana Č ornejová, Ji ř í Marek, Eva Procházková, Petr Svobodný, Alena Šolcová, and Stanislav Sousedík: Jan Marek Marci: Život, dílo, doba ,  Lanškroun: Rosa, 1995; and Sousedík: Philosophie der frühen Neuzeit, pp. 139-161.\n\n40 Arriaga, for instance, did not make any attempt to introduce mathematical considerations into philosophy, although he edited and published the work of his colleague Gregory of St. Vincent (1584-1667), that Leibniz heavily drew upon in his discovery of calculus. See Karl Eschweiler: 'Roderigo de Arriaga S.J.: Ein Beitrag zur Geschichte der Barokscholastik', in: Spanische Forschungen der Görresgeselschaft 3 (1931), p. 278; Marcus Hellyer: Catholic Physics: Jesuit Natural Philosophy In Early Modern Germany , South Bent, IN: University of Notre Dame Press 2005.\n\n41 See Petr Dvo ř ák and Jacob Schmutz, eds.: Juan Caramuel y Lobkowitz: The Last Scholastic Polymath , Praha: Filosofia 2008.\n\n## Daniel D. Novotný IN DEFENSE OF BAROQUE SCHOLASTICISM\n\n## III. DISTINCTIVE CHARACTER\n\nWhereas  the  basic  history  of  Renaissance  scholasticism  is  more  or  less known, our knowledge of Baroque scholasticism is much more rudimentary. 42 In  fact,  with  some  exaggeration,  we  may  say  that  historians  of  philosophy (especially Anglo-American) know nothing about it. One of the reasons for this fact  is  that  the  differences  between  Renaissance  and  Baroque  scholasticisms are not sufficiently understood. This section highlights some  of these differences.\n\nOne important feature of Baroque scholasticism has already been noted in the previous section. Baroque scholasticism is a blend of three philosophical schools,  namely  Jesuit,  Scotist,  and  Thomist.  Whereas  the  sixteenth-century (Renaissance)  scholasticism  was  characterized  by  Dominican  and  Jesuit  exegesis of Aristotle, the seventeenth century is dominated by the more progressive and diverse schools of the Jesuits and the Scotists. 43\n\nA  second  feature  of  Baroque  scholasticism  is  a  great  concern  for  systematic  thought. 44   The  passion  for  systematics  and  complexity  may  be  clearly seen in Baroque music and architecture. Although Copleston assumes the standard view of 'Renaissance' scholasticism being dead by mid-seventeenth century, he notes some changes in this respect around the time of Suárez:\n\nBoth Dominicans and Jesuits looked on St. Thomas as their Doctor. Aristotle  was  still  regarded  as  'the  Philosopher';  and  we  have  seen  that  Renaissance  Scholastics  continued  to  publish  commentaries  on  his  works.  At  the same time there was gradually effected a separation of philosophy from theology, more systematic and methodic than that which had been generally obtained in the medieval Schools. … We find, then, the gradual substitution of philosophical courses for commentaries on Aristotle [emphasis mine] . 45\n\n42 See Marcial Solana: Historia de la Filosofía Española, vols. 1-3, Madrid: Real Academia de ciencias exactas 1941.\n\n44 See Pereira: Suárez .\n\n43 True, the Thomists continued to produce solid works and there were other religious orders with their contributions, but these are, at least from the sociological point of view, not very influential  ( pace the  widespread  misconception,  such  as  Nuchelmans's:  'Thomism is  undoubtedly  the most influential school of thought in late-scholastic philosophy ', see Gabriel Nuchelmans: LateScholastic and Humanist Theories of the Proposition , Oxford - New York: North Holland Publishing Company 1980, p 7). Beside Poinsot and Araújo, the most important Baroque Thomistic authors were the French Dominican Antoine Goudin (1639-1695), the Austrian Benedictine Ludwig  Babenstuber  (1660-1726),  and  the  Carmelites  in  Alcalá  ( Complutum )  and  Salamanca  who published a complete philosophical and theological cursus between 1608-1704. See Jansen: 'Zur Phenomenologie der Philosophie', and Pereira and Fastiggi: The Mystical Theology .\n\n45 Copleston: A History of philosophy , p. 344.\n\n## Daniel D. Novotný IN DEFENSE OF BAROQUE SCHOLASTICISM\n\nThis leads to a third feature, namely a much looser attitude toward Aristotle (and  thus  Aquinas).  Suárez  routinely  complains  about  how  disorganized  the corpus Aristotelicum is; others, such as Caramuel even cease to be soi-disant Aristotelians.  We may observe progressively freer attitudes toward the philosophical authority of Aristotle, Aquinas or Scotus.\n\nThe  fourth  feature  concerns  the  increasing  preoccupation  of  Baroque scholastics with the intra-mental 'world.' Baroque authors describe the world with the sharpened awareness that the responsible description and explanation of it needs to take into account the act of describing and explaining itself, that the world is not simply 'mirrored' by our minds. They carry out what might be called 'epistemic' or 'cognitive ontology' which constantly switches back and  forth  between  the  epistemic  and  ontic  viewpoints.  Unlike  the  modern authors such as Descartes or Locke this does not, generally speaking, compromise their metaphysical and epistemological realism but they all share intense interest  in  the  'first-person'  perspective.  This  can  be  documented,  for  instance, by their passionate discussions about beings of reason. 46\n\nThe  last  feature  has  to  do  with  individualism  vs.  community  attitudes. 47 Modern non-scholastic philosophers develop their views with little regard for what the  larger  philosophical  community  thought  and  wrote;  their  argumentation took into account views of only a handful of authors. Also, their treatises often take up particular issues without intending to develop a comprehensive, all-embracing philosophical system. And even if they do intend to develop such a system, its drift may be original but it often lacks precision. In contrast, scholastic  philosophers (both in the Renaissance and the Baroque) took into account  a  large  number  of  works,  arguments,  and  positions;  their  aim  was usually  to  classify  and  present  all  possible  answers  to  a  question  before answering it in their own way. Moreover, they shared terminology, agenda, and training and this enabled them to reach the level of detail in their discussions which is unparalleled in non-scholastic philosophy at the time. Scholastics, in contrast to modern individualists, looked at themselves as workers in the large network. But there is a difference between Renaissance and Baroque scholastics: In the Renaissance the rule was not to name living adversaries and most authors  shied  away  from  originality.  In  the  Baroque,  individual  personalities came  much  more  clearly  to  the  fore.  Baroque  authors  engaged  in  extensive\n\n46 See  Forlivesi: ibid. p.  113;  Daniel  D.

It was  the  current  status  of  the  debate  that  most  concerned  them.  In  many respects  Baroque  culture  resembles  contemporary  'English  philosophy'  as described by Scruton:\n\nLet us say merely that contemporary English philosophy is modern in the true sense of the word … It attempts to build on past results and, where they are inadequate,  to  supersede  them.  Hence  English  philosophy  pays  scrupulous attention  to  arguments,  the  validity  of  which  it  is  constantly  assessing;  it  is like science, a collective endeavor, recognizing and absorbing the contributions of  many  different  workers  in  the  field;  its  problems  and  solutions  too  are collective, emerging often 'by an invisible hand' from the process of debate and scholarship. 48\n\nThis is not to deny that there are dissimilarities between the two cultures as well:\n\nModern  philosophers  are  not  system-builders  in  general:  or,  at  least,  their systems are peculiarly bare and unconsoling … Since the turn of the century, philosophical problems, and arguments have usually been introduced through articles, often devoted to some minute work of logical analysis, and sparking debates which to an outsider may seem extremely arid and in any case pointless  when  set  beside  the  aching  questions  of  the  human  spirit.  Learning  to take an insider's view of the debates, and to discover that they are not arid at all but, on the contrary, addressed to the most important human questions, is an exciting intellectual adventure. But it is hard work, and nothing can be learned without the patient study of difficult texts. The only mercy is that with few exceptions - the greatest works of modern philosophy are short. 49\n\nUnlike  contemporary  Anglo-American  philosophers,  Baroque  scholastics were  system-builders  par  excellence.  Every  Baroque  philosopher  aspired  to write a complete cursus, comprehending 'all of philosophy.' No one was considered an accomplished philosopher without having a comprehensive philosophical  system,  going  from  logic  though  natural  philosophy  to  metaphysics and  ethics.  There  was  no  division  of  labor  within  philosophy.  Hence,  'hot'\n\n48 Scruton: Modern  Philosophy ,  p.  1.  Interestingly,  Scruton's  description  of  contemporary 'English' (read: analytic) philosophy fits better Baroque scholastics than early modern non-scholastic philosophers - the late descendants of the modernist conquistadores become more similar to the  extinguished  tribe  than  they  are  to  their  glorious  forefathers.  Contemporary  analytic  metaphysics, so dissimilar to early modern epistemology-driven philosophy, would be another common denominator of 'English philosophy' and Baroque scholasticism.\n\n49 Scruton: Modern Philosophy , pp. 2-3.\n\n## Daniel D. Novotný IN DEFENSE OF BAROQUE SCHOLASTICISM\n\nphilosophical  problems  and  arguments  were  discussed  through  various  editions of huge volumes. Within these mammoth works, dozens of parallel discussions  were  going  on.  This  means,  sadly  for  us,  that  there  is  no  mercy  in Baroque scholasticism; none of their major works is short.\n\n## IV. WHY TO STUDY BAROQUE SCHOLASTICISM?\n\nContemporary Anglo-American historians of philosophy either completely overlook scholastic philosophy of the Baroque or their description of it is quite inadequate. Let me justify this claim with the example of three major synthetic works that have attempted to cover seventeenth-century scholastics: The Cambridge History of Later Medieval Philosophy , The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy ,  and The Cambridge History of Seventeenth-Century Philosophy . 50   Each of these otherwise outstanding works fails completely when it comes to Baroque scholasticism. The faults of these works are not by commission but by omission. When something is said, it  is  usually  correct  but  it  is  almost  nothing.  These works do not relate basic facts of seventeenth-century scholasticism; they show no  knowledge  about  major  Jesuit  or  Scotistic  philosophers  of  the  time;  and they  do  not  gather  a  proper  bibliography  in  English,  let  alone  in  other  languages. At the deepest level the problem with the current state of Anglo-American knowledge of Baroque scholasticism is not just ignorance of elementary facts but the second-order ignorance of its own ignorance, which is not even aware of the lack of knowledge in this area. Perhaps, this is a phenomenon of Everybody's Land = Nobody's Land: the Renaissance and later medieval scholars take the seventeenth century as too late and seventeenth-century scholars focus primarily on nonscholastic authors. 51\n\n50 Norman Kretzmann, Anthony Kenny, Jan Pinborg,  and  Eleonore  Stump: The  Cambridge History of Later Medieval Philosophy: From the Rediscovery of Aristotle to the Disintegration of Scholasticism, 1100-1600, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1982/1988; Charles B. Schmitt, Quentin Skinner, Eckhard Kessler, and Jill Kraye, eds.: The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy ,  Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1988/1991; Daniel Garber and Michael Ayers, The  Cambridge  History  of  Seventeenth-Century  Philosophy ,  Cambridge:  Cambridge  University Press 1998/2003.\n\n51 To be more specific in my criticism of the standard historiography let me mention, for instance, The Cambridge History of Seventeenth-Century Philosophy. The book is to be praised for superb  articles  on  non-scholastic  philosophy  and  for  not  entirely  ignoring  the  scholastic  mainstream. Suárez even made it to the list of canonical authors worthy of having the titles of their works abbreviated (pp. xv-xvii). Apart from Suárez, however, no major post-Suarezian scholastic philosopher is discussed. There is a list of primary literature (pp. 1472-1586), which includes, besides Suárez: Collegium Complutense (without indicating whether Carmelites or Dominicans are meant  -  they  were  two),  Collegium  Conimbricense,  Punch  (without  mentioning  his  main  rival Mastri, the princeps scotistarum ), John of St. Thomas, Rubio, Ś miglecki, and Vázquez. The names of  Toledo  and  Fonseca  also  appear,  although  the  two  lived  and  died  in  the  sixteenth  century. Equally, if not more, important Jesuit thinkers such as Arriaga, Compton Carleton, Hurtado, Izqui-\n\n## Daniel D. Novotný IN DEFENSE OF BAROQUE SCHOLASTICISM\n\nWhy  so  few  seventeenth-century  scholars  pay  attention  to  the  Baroque philosophy? There are at least  two reasons. First is  that  research  on  the  Baroque  is  difficult.  Any  'English-speaking  student  bold  enough'  to  study  it needs to face (1) a linguistic barrier, namely humanistic Latin, (2) the lack of helpful secondary literature, (3) a general skepticism as to the value of what he or she is doing, and (4) the enormous complexity and length of Baroque scholastic works. 52  Moreover, Baroque scholastic works are not just long and highly complex  taken  individually,  but  they  are  also  linked  to  each  other  by  innumerous references, sometimes explicit but mostly implicit. Scholastic authors freely borrowed from each other and what seems to be an original argument might be in fact  just  a  currently  fashionable topos .  Most  controversies  of  the time have to do with disagreements about the analysis of some traditional slogan  which  they  all  accept  as  a  platitude.  Hence,  the  real  disagreements  of Baroque authors are often hidden to the eye of superficial readers and the only adequate  way  to  understand  them  is  through  a  patient  and  in-depth  comparative research.\n\nA second reason why Baroque scholasticism gets so little attention has to do with its sui generis philosophical culture and the need to approach it without bias  and  a  priori  evaluations  in  terms  of  standards  foreign  to  it.  The  bias toward the Baroque comes from at least three sources. The first is inherited from the fathers of modern philosophy and their superficial, outsider knowledge of the scholastic culture of their time. 53  Descartes, for example, disliked scholastic  authors,  such  as  Toletus,  Rubio,  and  the  Coimbrans  (AT  III,  185) that he learned from in La Flèche. On the other hand, he praised Eustache de erdo, and Oviedo, among others, do not leave a trace. Most appalling is the absence of Caramuel. And not only is the primary bibliography deficient, but even the secondary one. Thus, for instance, even the must-read books of Ignacio Angelelli: Studies on Gottlob Frege and Traditional Philosophy , Dordrecht, Holland: D. Reidel 1967, and Larry Hickman: Modern Theories of Higher Level Predicates: Second Intentions in the Neuzeit , München: Philosophia Verlag, 1980) in English and Kobush's Sein und Sprache and Blum's Philosophenphilosophie und Schulphilosophie in German are not listed, let alone several important articles and studies in Spanish. The translations of John of St. Thomas into English are also ignored (even though there is a French translation in the list). Even more  serious  complaints  could  be  raised  about  other  books  in  the  Cambridge  History  series. Indeed, I am not aware of a synthetic history of seventeenth-century scholasticism in English that would go substantially beyond Copleston's A History of Philosophy . The recent German scholarship is in far better condition, and even though I am only imperfectly acquainted with French, Italian and Spanish scholarship, it is certainly much better informed. For similar criticisms see Lüthy: 'What To Do With Seventeenth-Century Natural Philosophy?', pp. 178-186.\n\n- 53 As Stone observes, ' For the most part, contemporary historians of philosophy tend to imitate the disparaging comments that 'modern' philosophers … directed at their scholastic teachers ' - 'Aristotelianism and Scholasticism', p. 8.\n- 52 See Stone: 'Aristotelianism and Scholasticism', p. 7.\n\n## Daniel D. Novotný IN DEFENSE OF BAROQUE SCHOLASTICISM\n\nSaint Paul (1573-1640). Anybody, who has ever looked into the works of the four mentioned authors, will agree with Dennis Des Chene:\n\nEustachius's Summa quadripartita , which Descartes called 'the best book ever written on this matter,' is, to put it bluntly, not. It is a kind of Cliff's Notes condensation, mainly of the Coimbrans, from whom Eustachius sometimes takes whole sentences verbatim. It is extremely sparing in its citations of authorities  …, it often gives  no  arguments for  its  conclusions,  and  it  rarely considers  alternatives  or  objections.  I  am  inclined  to  think  that  Descartes, who had no patience for details, little regard for authority, and an aversion to dialectic, liked it because it was unequivocal, comprehensive, and short. 54\n\nModern  nonscholastic  philosophers  were  for  the  most  part dilettantes , whereas scholastic philosophers were professionals . Their perspectives differ and hence  we  should  not  take  the  judgment  of  Descartes  and  Locke  as  the  last word. 55   It  is,  of  course,  an  interesting  question  why  in  the  end  the  moderns won over the scholastics but we should not presume that this has anything to do with winning a fair philosophical dispute. 56\n\nThe second source of prejudice against Baroque scholasticism comes from the Thomistic historiography of the nineteenth and twentieth century. John of St.  Thomas  was  considered  to  be  the  best  Thomistic  author  and  Suárez  the\n\n54 Dennis  Des  Chene: Physiologia:  natural  philosophy  in  late  Aristotelian  and  Cartesian thought , Ithaca: Cornell University Press 1996), p. 11.\n\n56 The moderns won not because they were smarter than the scholastics (they were not), nor because they had science (the scholastics had it too), nor because they were non-Christians (except for Hume and Spinoza they were mostly Christians too). In my opinion, the reasons for their victory have to do with their status of being laymen living in a secular environment, existentially independent from ecclesiastic institutions. Also, their works are much shorter, written in a personal style of national languages. It was also unfortunate that Baroque authors bought into a false cosmology. There were authors, such as Arriaga, who favored heliocentrism, but his view was seen as 'extreme' and exceptional. See Sousedík: Philosophie de frühen Neuzeit ,  p.  84  ( Filosofie v č eských zemích ,  p. 103), and Edward Grant, 'Were there Significant Differences between Medieval and  Early  Modern  Scholastic  Natural  Philosophy?',  in: Noûs 18  (1984):  5-14.  When  the  scholastics lost the cosmology battle, the impression was that all philosophy that these people did was wrong.\n\n55 Today, the differences between insiders and informed outsiders are no less apparent than they were in the time of Descartes. For instance, the BBC's program In Our Time announced the results  of  a  popular  poll  of  'the  greatest  philosopher'  in  July  2005.  The  vote  was  preceded  by weeks of presentations by professional scholars on their favorite philosopher, thus the vote was made by an informed public. The results were surprising even to the moderator himself (Melvyn Bragg): Marx (27.93%), Hume (12.67%), Wittgenstein (6.80%), Nietzsche (6.49%), Plato (5.65%), Kant  (5.61%),  Aquinas  (4.83%),  Socrates  (4.82%),  Aristotle  (4.52%),  and  Popper  (4.20%).  Such results could be hardly expected from contemporary professional philosophers. John R. Shook has half-seriously tried to compile an ordered list, which comes much closer to what I would expect the  results  to  be  among  today's  Anglo-American  professionals  (except  for  Buddha):  Plato,  Kant, Aristotle, Hegel, Leibniz, Aquinas, Hume, Buddha, Descartes, and Nietzsche.

Other  Baroque  authors  were  believed  to  be  inferior and sometimes even 'decadent.' Hence they did not deserve to be carefully studied. Some historians went even further and stressed the gap between the medieval genius (Aquinas, Scotus, Ockham) and the second-rate and derivative nature of the Renaissance and Baroque scholastics. 57\n\nThe third source of prejudice comes from experts on Renaissance philosophy (both scholastic and non-scholastic). For instance, Charles H. Lohr, a confrere of Suárez and a great pioneer of Renaissance Aristotelian research says:\n\nCursus philosophicus … was meant to be an answer to the syncretism, skepticism and new encyclopedism which threatened the scholastic view of the world. … An increasing narrowness was consequently a second characteristic of the cursus. Whereas writers like Pereira and Suárez had still attempted to master the entire tradition, the philosophy professors of post-Tridentine Catholic schools had less and less direct knowledge of Greek and Arabic sources and even a very limited acquaintance with their own medieval Latin authorities. 58\n\nLohr  assumes  that  since  'post-Tridentine  professors'  had  less  direct knowledge of Greek and Arabic sources, they were 'increasingly narrow.' In fact, most of these professors did not care for the Greeks and the Arabs. They were  interested  in  issues  and  arguments,  not  so  much  in  history  as  such. Hence, although they are less accomplished as historians of  philosophy,  this does  not  mean  that  they  do  not  make  any  progress  from  the  systematical, problem-solving, point of view. Lohr continues:\n\nBecause their teaching was directed in each case to the members of a specific religious community, they stressed the importance of its uniformity. Disturbed by the doctrinal confusion which marked the Renaissance period, they tended increasingly to return to the teaching of one of the great thirteenth-century doctors. … Summaries of scholastic philosophy were composed in Spain by the Jesuits Pedro Hurtado de Mendoza and Francisco de Oviedo, the Dominican John of St. Thomas and the Carmelite college of Alcalà; in France by the Cistercian  Eustachius  a  S.  Paulo  (who  is  said  to  have  an  influence  on Descartes);  in  Italy  by  the  Jesuit  Cosma  Alamanni  and  the  Franciscans Bartholomeus Mastrius and Bonaventura Bellutus; and for use in Germany and Eastern Europe by the Jesuit Roderigo de Arriaga. 59\n\n57 Needless  to  say,  fundamentally  Thomistic  convictions as  such do  not necessitate biased historiography, they just often lead to it.\n\n59 Ibid.\n\n58 Lohr: 'Metaphysics', p. 619.\n\n## Daniel D. Novotný IN DEFENSE OF BAROQUE SCHOLASTICISM\n\nIt is true that most of the scholastic philosophical literature was directed to a  specific  religious  community,  but  it  would  be  wrong  to  think  that  such literature was 'uniform' - not even within a given community. 60  The Baroque period  (especially  from  1620  until  1680)  was  marked  by  great  controversies both across and within divides of the philosophical schools. Controversies are mostly  recorded  in  subsequent  revisions  of  various  cursus,  and  they  are constant and explicit. Also, as already indicated above, Baroque professors did not care that much for the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. It was common practice  to  enlist  Aquinas  as  an  authority,  but  he  could  very  much  look  as  a Scotus or an Ockham. It should be also pointed out that it is strange to list Eustachius's little pocket book next to the great works of Mastri, Arriaga and others (the list has also important omissions). Eustachius's work is truly a mere 'summary  of  scholastic  philosophy.'  Other  works  on  the  list,  however,  are 'summaries'  only  in  the  sense  in  which,  for  instance,  David  Armstrong's Universals and Scientific Realism is a 'summary of analytic metaphysics.' 61\n\nIt would be premature to make a definitive evaluative judgment about the qualities  of  Baroque  scholastic  culture.  Moreover,  there  are  various  aspects which need to be considered. First, creativity: With few exceptions, Baroque scholastics did not try to create completely new systems or come up with quite new perspectives. They were creative in spite of their efforts not to be, but the creativity  is  not  their  strongest  suit. 62   Secondly,  the  kind  of  sources  that Baroque authors take into account: In general, with the exception of Suárez, they did not try to take too many historical sources into account. Beside a few standard classics (Aristotle, Aquinas, Scotus, and various commentators) they mainly discussed the views of their living colleagues. Thirdly, the diversity of topics: Every author aspired to deal with every standard issue. Within the framework of standard issues, various new sub-topics emerged but relatively rarely completely  new  topics  emerged.  The  advantage  of  this  approach  was  that issues were treated with the knowledge of the overall place in a comprehensive\n\n60 Also the mere fact that some philosophy is done within a closely-knit community should not  taint  it.  From  the  antiquity  we  see  that  communities  bound  together  by  some  fundamental convictions may produce outstanding results (e.g., Pythagoras's sect, Plato's Academy, Aristotle's Lyceum).\n\n62 The sense in which the Renaissance and Baroque scholasticism was and was not creative is well described by Forlivesi, 'A Man, an Age, A Book,' 40-48.\n\n61 Lohr further claims that ' Suárez stood not so much at the beginning as at the end of a long tradition ' ( ibid. , p. 615). However, if one studies exemplary Baroque works patiently and in depth, one can see quite the contrary. Moreover, not all Baroque scholastic philosophy was cursus-writing.  Focused  studies  (today  we  would  say  'essays'),  such  as  Izquierdo's Pharus  scienciarum (1659),  which  took  up  the  Baconian  project  of New organon ,  or  Caramuel's Leptotatos (1681), which developed the idea of a construction of a new artificial onto-language, were also immersed in this 'cursus-tradition.'\n\n## Daniel D. Novotný IN DEFENSE OF BAROQUE SCHOLASTICISM\n\nphilosophical system; the disadvantage was that nobody became a specialist in one or a few issues only.  Fourthly,  the  quality  of  argumentation:  This  is  the strongest point of Baroque authors. The detail and density of their argumentation  is  enormous.  Their  works  could  be  abbreviated  and  some  tangential issues left out, but in general the complexity of their arguments is not due to superficial rhetoric but to the inherent difficulty of the issues they dealt with. The philosophical culture of the Baroque age has certainly limitations but it is also  one  of  the  most  advanced  and  sophisticated  cultures  in  the  history  of philosophy.  Its  main  virtue  consists  in  trying  to  approach  important  philosophical issues with detailed methods of rigorous analysis and argumentation, while placing them into the context of a comprehensive theory. 63\n\nDaniel D.

Baroque scholasticism (BS) is a distinct and valuable philosophical culture that flourished from ~1600-1700 and deserves more scholarly attention.\n\n2. BS has been neglected by mainstream Anglo-American historiography of philosophy.\n\nKEY PREMISES SUPPORTING MAIN CLAIMS:\n\nP1: BS has distinctive features that set it apart from Renaissance scholasticism:\n- Blend of Jesuit, Scotist and Thomist schools\n- Greater focus on systematic thought\n- Looser attitude toward Aristotle\n- Increased focus on mental/cognitive aspects\n- More individualistic approach while maintaining community standards\n\nP2: BS was neglected due to:\n- Difficulty of research (language barrier, lack of secondary literature, complexity)\n- Biases inherited from:\n  - Early modern philosophers' critiques\n  - Thomistic historiography\n  - Renaissance scholars' prejudices\n\nP3: BS has significant philosophical value:\n- Sophisticated argumentation and analysis\n- Comprehensive systematic approach\n- Professional rather than dilettante philosophy\n- Important contributions to perennial problems\n\nRELATIONS:\n\n- P1 supports claim that BS is distinct and worthy of study\n- P2 explains historical neglect\n- P3 justifies call for increased scholarly attention\n\nThe paper aims to establish BS as a legitimate and valuable area of philosophical study while explaining and countering reasons for its historical neglect by Anglo-American scholarship.\n\nLet me know if you would like me to elaborate on any part of this analysis.",
