    "user_content": "## SUBJECTIVITY AND THE ENCOUNTER WITH BEING\n\nJason M. Costanzo\n\nForthcoming in the Review of Metaphysics\n\nI\n\nIn the 17 th century, RenŽ Descartes revolutionized metaphysics with six short meditations on the nature  of  subjectivity,  reality  and  God.    Certainly  the  groundwork  for  the  insights  contained within this work must have been implicitly laid down much earlier within ancient and medieval thought.    Nonetheless,  the  meditations  are  understood  as  a  metaphysical  endeavor  in  Òfirst philosophyÓ,  and  the  particular  manner  in  which  Descartes  achieved  this  end  served  as  the precise  point  of  differentiation  between  the  account  of  being  there  given  and  the  history  of metaphysical thought that preceded it.  Within this work, subjectivity and consciousness are for the first time established as a primary concern for metaphysics.  This arose on the basis of the Cartesian discovery of the ego, the I think at bottom to the encounter with being, which is further interpreted from the perspective of a phenomenal world that has been cast into doubt in regards to  its  being.    Although  the  primary  aim  of  these  meditations  was  to  provide  a  more  firm foundation  for  metaphysics,  history  tells  us  another  story.    So  Kant  would  later  question  the possibilities of metaphysics on the basis of what was, in principle, a Cartesian foundation.  Kant likewise concluded that subjectivity, rather than serving as the door into being, instead serves as an impenetrable obstacle to knowledge of things themselves.  Far from obtaining a more firm foundation, metaphysics was instead deemed impossible.\n\nTo this day, we still philosophize beneath the great shadow of KantÕs judgment.  That is not to say that metaphysics is not practiced, for indeed it is and there are both now and have been within the history of philosophy since Kant a number of noteworthy metaphysicians.  What is nonetheless troublesome is the fact that subjectivity is still very much seen as a terrible impasse impeding metaphysical progress.  In consequence, we no longer speak of being as such but only being in relation to the subject.  The reduction of metaphysics to subjectivity is likewise evident within  the  premier  works  of  19 th and  20 th century  thoughtÑfrom  the  Kantian  a  priori,  to  the Hegelian absolute where being and nothing are collapsed within thought into a single concept- synthesis, to HeideggerÕs renewal of the question of being which, although cognizant and even critical of the Cartesian turn, nonetheless resolves being into the subjectÕs dispositional stances of  being-there  ( Dasein ).    In  each  case,  the  classical  Aristotelian  idea  of  a  science  of  being  is either rejected or transformed into post-metaphysical forms of critical or relational ontology. 1\n\nClassically  construed,  metaphysics  was  understood  as  the  science  of  being  as  being.  The repetition as  being further  served  to  indicate  the  aspect  according  to  which  this  science  was thought  to  study  its  subject  matter.    It  is  inherently  reflective  ( reflexio ).    But  it  is  not  only reflective in the sense in which x is x involves reflection.  As a product of the human encounter with  being,  metaphysics  both  includes  subjectivity  but  was  likewise  thought  to  transcend  the subject on the basis of the human reflective capacity to Òdouble backÓ upon itself in thinking, as it were, to reflect upon the nature of its own encounter.\n\nThat metaphysics should be founded upon an act of reflection ought not to be surprising. Indeed,  we  discover  reflection  first  among  the  ancient  philosophers  as,  for  example,  Socrates who establishes self-examination as a primary concern for the thinker. 2 Within Plato, reflection is central to the possibilities inherent in knowledge of the Good and the intellectual ascent into the  intelligible  realm.    So  within  the  allegory  of  the  cave,  the  prisoners  are  first  completely immersed in a world of appearances. 3 The  shadows  upon  the  wall  are  said  to  preoccupy  the prisoners  who are in turn  embedded in the life of the body, of being in the world and beingdirected  toward  objects  without  consideration  of  the  metaphysical  ground  of  such  objects. Suddenly there is an awakening, which is to say, the awakening into reflection. A prisoner is forced to stand up, to turn around (as a doubling back) and to gaze upon the light of the fire. Even as the eyes of the prisoner are pained by that light, he is nonetheless forced (for after all, the  allegory  is  about  the  nature  of  education)  to  make  the  ascent  to  the  surface  and  into knowledge, where, following an arduous process of acclimation to the brilliance of the light of the sun, there is finally a vision of the sun itself.  Far from a static possession of facts, the vision of the sun, here a symbol for the Good, is interpreted once again as a complete turning of the\n\n1 Among contemporary speculative realists, including Ray Brassier, Ian Hamilton Grant, Graham Harman, etc., what is  here  called  Òrelational  ontologyÓ  is  termed  ÒcorrelationismÓ,  as  first  coined  by  Quentin  Meillassoux  in After Finitude: An Essay on the Necessity of Contingency , trans. Ray Brassier (London: Continuum, 2008), 5.\n\n2 Plato, Apology 38a.\n\n3 Plato, Republic 514a-521e.\n\norgan of knowing in such a way that knowledge of that which is reflects back upon the knower and is transformed into self-knowledge. 4\n\nIf we consider further the works of Aristotle, we find that in spite of the extant differences between these two thinkers, a likeness of foundation is yet discernible.  In the first place, there are the four causes ( aitiai ) wherein the final cause culminates in a reaching out toward the Good as the aim and end of all human desire and action.  Metaphysics is also called wisdom ( sophia ) and through contemplation ( theoria ), wisdom is reckoned within the Nichomachean Ethics as the supreme source of human well-being. 5 Although Aristotle considers the heights of wisdom in many ways unattainable, as the sole possession of the gods, he nonetheless urges on pursuit of this science.  Finally, contemplation entails reflection, and in AristotleÕs characterization of the prime  mover  within  the  twelfth  book  of  the Metaphysics according  to  the  notion  of  thought thinking  itself  ( noesis  noeseos ),  we  discover  reflection  expressed  in  its  highest  and  most complete form. 6\n\nThat Aristotle should later characterize metaphysics as the science of being as being follows almost naturally from the very aims of wisdom.  For how else are we to attain to the universal and  objective  perspective  with  respect  to  the truth of  being  if  there  is  not  a  like  subjective context according to which such a perspective is expressed?  Reflection and the desire to know emerge as the foundation of metaphysical inquiry.  On the other hand, from the perspective of the immersion of consciousness within the life of the body, the higher metaphysical and quite transcendent standpoint could never be achieved.\n\nWhat is  in  consequence  required  is  a retrieval of  the  classical  Aristotelian  conception  of metaphysics.    First  and  foremost  such  retrieval  involves  reaffirmation  of  the  possibilities  of metaphysics as a science in the broader sense of an objective and systematic body of knowledge about  being.    Since  Descartes,  the  history  of  thinking  about  being,  far  from  metaphysics, emphasizes instead relational forms of ontology inasmuch as the subject now takes center stage in the account of being.  From such a perspective, there is no longer a scientific study of being as being but at best descriptive analysis of being in relation to me, as it were, being for a subject . This is a fundamental addition that leads to an entirely separate domain of inquiryÑone that we\n\n4 So  in  the Republic (508e),  Plato  speaks  of  the  Good  as  bestowing  both  truth  and  the  power  of  knowing  to  the knower.\n\n5 Aristotle, Nichomachean Ethics 1178b8.\n\n6 Aristotle, Metaphysics 1074b30-35.\n\ndo not here censure but only seek to isolate from metaphysics proper.\n\nFor  over  two  centuries  metaphysics  has  suffered  serious  and  in  many  ways  irrecoverable damage  on  account  of  confusion  and  critique.    Despite  this,  the  science  of  being  remains, awaiting further development, the foundations of which having first been laid down by Aristotle and the scholastics.  The positive retrieval of metaphysics inevitably demands a detailed process of  historical  analysis,  a  process  that  we  can  never  hope  to  fully  achieve  within  a  single ÒcommentaryÓ on this problem.  Despite this, it is our hope that the efforts here made will serve as an initial starting point toward such retrieval.\n\nII\n\nAlthough Cartesian thought represents the springboard for the later transformation of metaphysics into relational ontology, within Kant that transformation is developed in its most complete form.  Indeed, the Kantian a priori severed the relationship between appearance and reality and in Kant the transcendent nature of being takes on an entirely new status.  So the term ÒtranscendenceÓ finds its origin in the Latin transcendentalis , related to transcendens , the latter formed  from  the  combination  of transÒacrossÓ  and  scandere Òto  climbÓ.    Transcendence involves  an  ascent  that  crosses  over  into  something  other  in  the  sense  of  reaching  past, surpassing  and  surmounting.    Although  the  philosophical  usage  of  this  term  finds  its  origin among the scholastics, the actual expression seems to have been popularized by Kant. 7 Prior to Kant, the Latin transcendens was used in reference to and as a characterization for being ( ens ), insofar  as  being  was  thought  to  soar  above  all  differences.    A  similar  view  was  early  on expressed  by  Aristotle  within  the Metaphysics in  recognition  of  the  fact  that  any  and  every difference added to being must itself be some thing, for which reason he concluded that being cannot be a genus. 8 He  further  noted  that  being  ( to  on )  and  the  one  ( to  hen )  are  coextensive, inasmuch as the subject remains undifferentiated in the transition from x  is to x  is  one . 9 The scholastics later added to this the doctrine of transcendentals, viz., that not only are being and\n\n7 See  Jan  Aertsen, Medieval  Philosophy  as  Transcendental  thought:  From  Philip  the  Chancellor  (CA.  1225)  To Francisco Su‡rez (Leiden: Brill 2012), 13-15.  Apparently John Duns Scotus was the first to speak of metaphysics as Òtranscendental scienceÓ, e.g., see Simo Knuuttila, ÒThe Metaphysics of the Categories in John Duns Scotus,Ó in Categories of Being: Essays on Metaphysics and Logic , ed. Leila Haaparanta &amp; Heikki J. Koskinen (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), 62-77.\n\n8 Aristotle, Metaphysics , 998b23, 1059b33.\n\none  convertible  ( ens  et  unum  convertuntur )  but  also  truth  ( verum ),  goodness  ( bonum ),  and something  ( aliquid ). 10 These  were  likewise  all  referred  to  beneath  the  general  heading ÒtranscendentalisÓ.\n\nLater  on,  through  the  influence  of  Kant,  the  term  ÒtranscendentalÓ  assumed  an  entirely different meaning.  So in the Critique of Pure Reason ,  Kant rejected these scholastic doctrines and further reduced the Aristotelian categories to a priori concepts of pure understanding which he  characterized  as  the:  Òlogical  requirements  and  criteria  of  all knowledge of  things  in generalÓ. 11 Even  as  Kant  rejected  these  scholastic  notions,  he  nonetheless  retained  the  term ÒtranscendentalÓ on account of the recognizable affinity between the old usage of this term and his own application on the basis of the a priori conditions of experience in general.  But what is far  more  interesting  is  that  conscious  reflection  is  once  more  brought  in  for  the  purpose  of explanation of the basis of our knowledge of such transcendental conditions of experience.  This can be seen in examination of his discussion of both the peculiar way in which we discover the concepts of pure understanding in contradistinction to the method of pure reason as well as the source of the unity of consciousness brought forth upon the basis of transcendental apperception.\n\nSo in the second edition to the Critique in The Amphiboly of Concepts of Reflection, we read  the  following:  ÒReflection  ( reflexio) Ó,  Kant  asserts,  Òdoes  not  concern  itself  with  objects themselves with a view to deriving concepts from them directlyÓ, but instead to, Òthe state of mind in which we first set ourselves to discover the subjective conditions under which [alone] we are able to arrive at concepts.Ó 12 In  other words, the primary concern of reflection is the a priori form of experience as opposed to the a posteriori content or matter of it. We might in turn say that reflection looks to the transcendental conditions of our experience.\n\nKant further analyzes the nature of the reflective act itself, noting that this act involves a consideration  of:  Ò identity and difference ,  of agreement and opposition ,  of  the inner and  the outer , and finally of the determinable and the determination (matter and form).Ó 13 The dialectic\n\n9 Ibid. 1003b27.\n\n10 See Thomas Aquinas, De Veritate , q. 1, a. 1. On other accounts, beauty is likewise included as a transcendental. See,  e.g.,  Jacques  Maritain ,  Art  and  Scholasticism (Indiana:  University  of  Notre  Dame  Press,  1974)  and  more recently  Alice  Ramos, Dynamic  Transcendentals:  Truth,  Goodness  and  Beauty  from  a  Thomistic  Perspective (Washington: The Catholic University of America Press, 2012).\n\n11 Immanuel  Kant, Critique  of  Pure  Reason ,  trans.  Norman  Kemp  Smith  (Boston/New  York:  Macmillan  &amp;  Co., 1965), B114.\n\n12 Ibid. B316.\n\n13 Ibid. B317.\n\nthat  here  emerges  is  determined  to  be  a  fundamental  offspring  of  the  act  of  reflection.    Kant further  proceeds  to  distinguish logical  reflection ,  at  bottom  comparative  in  nature,  from transcendental  reflection ,  said  to  involve  consideration  of  Òthe  objects  themselvesÓ  which further, Òcontains the ground of possibility of the objective comparison of representations with each  otherÓ. 14 As  such,  for  Kant,  transcendental  reflection  upon  the  a  priori  conditions  of experience serves as a basis for logical reflection upon experience that follows from this. 15\n\nIn other passages within the Critique , Kant emphasizes the reflective dimension at ground to the deduction of the pure concepts.  He further distinguishes the method of understanding from that  of  pure  reason:  ÒWhatever  we  may  have  to  decide  as  to  the  possibility  of  the  concepts derived  from  pure  reasonÓ,  he  asserts  within  the  opening  paragraph  to  the  Transcendental Dialectic, Òit is at least true that they are not obtained by mere reflection but only be inference.Ó He  goes  on  to  distinguish  such  concepts  or  ideas  of  reason  from  the  concepts  of  pure understanding,  adding  that  these  latter:  Òcontain  nothing  but  the  unity  of  reflection  upon phenomena.Ó 16 Two points stand out in relation to this distinction.  First, the pure concepts are again  discoverable  through  an  act  of  reflection  and  so  appear  in  relation  to  the  reflective  and quite  transcendental  Òstate  of  mindÓ  that  considers  the  conditions  of  this  encounter.    Second, actual  metaphysical  inquiry,  through  pure  reason,  no  longer  involves  reflection  but  instead inference.  This is an essential point.  Following KantÕs analysis, the foundations of metaphysics depends upon the way in  which we experience the world, and we can only know this through reflective consideration of the conditions of our experience.  On the other hand, metaphysics in its  actuality  (as  practiced)  involves  rational  (inferential)  speculation  that  follows  upon  the reflective act of discovery.\n\nAlong with the pure concepts of understanding, the problem of the unity of consciousness is likewise  resolved  through  the  act  of  reflection.    This  can  be  seen  in  KantÕs  account  of transcendental  apperception  wherein  a  distinction  is  formed  between  the  empirical  ego  as\n\n14 Ibid. B318.\n\n15 One of the interesting results of KantÕs analysis here has to do with the immediate influence it would exert upon the thought of the later German Idealists that followed and in particular in relation to Hegelian dialectic.  So within the Science  of  Logic ,  although  Hegel  rejects  the  static  manner  in  which  Kant  determines  the  pure  concepts,  he nonetheless adopts the very same reflective determination as the core foundation of dialectical idealism.  Although Hegel likewise confounds thinking and being, his use of reflection is of particular interest if we consider the fact that in  many ways Hegel considered his own thought as following within the direct lineage of Aristotle who himself gave priority to reflection with respect to metaphysical thinking. 16\n\nIbid. A310/B367.\n\nimmanent within consciousness and the transcendental ego as the unifying principle at ground to consciousness.  So in the Transcendental Deduction within the first edition to the Critique , Kant denies access to the ego a posteriori insofar as: ÒNo fixed and abiding self can present itself in this flux of inner appearances.Ó 17 Following this, he nonetheless affirms the necessity of an a priori unifying principle at bottom to the various representations of experience on account of the fact  that  experience  finds  a  focal  point  in  the  subject  of  experience.    So  as  the  manifold  of appearances are referred to a focal point, viz., the transcendental ego, to that extent the ego has: Òbefore  its  eye  the  identity  of  its  act,  whereby  it  subordinates  all  synthesis  of  apprehension (which is empirical) to a transcendental unity, thereby rendering possible their interconnection to a  priori rules.Ó 18 For  this  reason,  Kant  suggests  that  appearances  Òall  belong  to  meÓ  and  are ÒmineÓ.  He further adds that appearances find unity in and through the ego insofar as they are all referred to a single Òself-consciousnessÓ. 19 In effect, although Kant will later deny knowledge of the substance of the ego, he nonetheless affirms knowledge of the referential relations that hold between appearances and the transcendental ego as the focal point of those appearances.\n\nAt this point we might pause in order to consider the precise nature of this knowledge. For even if  we  reject  the  Kantian  a  priori,  we  nonetheless  discover,  as  Kant  has  pointed  out,  that experience retains a specific subjective character , which is to say, involves the specific addition of consciousness over and above experience. 20 What Kant has likewise shown is that from the perspective of consciousness, the objects of experience are reinterpreted as appearances that are now  said  to  be for  an  ego .    Through  reflection,  we  not  only  discover  a  separate  domain  of knowledge, but in the dialectic that unfolds from this, we obtain the ground of possibility for determining what does and does not belong properly to subjectivity itself.  Reflection reveals a distinction between being for a subject and being apart from the subject.  This shall then be the perspective according to which the proper foundation of metaphysics shall here be determined, viz.,  by  way  of  reflective  analysis  of  the  relational  structures  inherent  in  consciousness  and\n\n17 Ibid. A107.\n\n18 Ibid. A108.\n\n19 Ibid. B134. The full text states: ÒThe thought that the representations given in intuition one and all belong to me, is therefore equivalent to the thought that I unite them in one self-consciousness, or can at least so unite them; and although  this  thought  is  not  itself  the  consciousness  of  the synthesis of  the  representations,  it  presupposes  the possibility of that synthesis.  In other words, only insofar as I can grasp the manifold of the representations in one consciousness, do I call them one and all mine .  For otherwise I should have as many-coloured and diverse a self as I have representations of which I am conscious to myself.Ó\n\n20 This  notion  of  subjective  character  is  here  derived  from  Thomas  Nagel,  ÒWhat it is  Like  to  Be  a  Bat,Ó  in The Philosophical Review 83, no. 2 (Oct. 1974): 435-450.\n\nexperience.\n\nIn the order of consciousness and experience, what is prior and first?  Initially, we might answer that the life of the ego is first inasmuch I know myself more than my own body and indeed I know myself best as thinking.  But if we consider the initial state of consciousness that the child first awakens to within the womb and at birth, what is first is never the life of ego, the life of thinking, but instead the life of the body.  Thinking follows after the life of the body.  Before thought, there is first sensation and perception through which we are inundated with innumerable objects and their properties.  We experience pain and pleasure, can feel and at times hear the rhythmic pulse of our heart.  Our skin brushes up against our surroundings and our legs and body press against the ground.  We further perceive other bodies in the world, both close at hand and at a distance.  Through the life of the body we thereafter discover that I think , but it is never the other way around.  We do not think and then discover the body. Rather, we are embodied and then we discover thinking.\n\nThe life of the body is in consequence first on the order of experience.  As embodied, the ego lives within the life of the body, interacting with the world and with other bodies.  Within this state, the ego does not initially recognize and differentiate itself from its life within the body. The ego feels, perceives, wants, and when it thinks, it thinks through the life of the body.  For the embodied ego, I and my body are one.\n\nBut the life of the body, of embodiment, is not the only life lived by the ego. The ego has instead  a  life  of  its  own,  even  as  it  is  tied  to  the  body.    This  is  immediately  evident  in examination of the value we place upon our own bodies inasmuch as it is never the body itself that is first and foremost valued, but instead the life of the ego in the body.  So we tend to the health of the body for the sake of the ego that lives through the body.  Still more, far from being just  the  body,  within  great  illness,  disease  or  bodily  misfortune,  the  ego  learns  to  despise  the body.    Suddenly  the  body  becomes  a  weight  that  mercilessly  suffocates  the  ego.    We  in  turn recognize that we are bound to our body and through our body compelled to attend to the life of the body, regardless of will or desire.  As such, the health, sustenance and continuance of the life of the body is held as something altogether precious insofar as another life, both tied to while yet\n\nentirely its own, thrives within and through the body.\n\nPleasure and in particular pain further reveal that we are more than just the life of our body. We might formulate arguments in proof of the non-existence of the ego, but beneath the power of pain we quickly forget such arguments and learn to know of the ego.  Pain penetrates through the body and into the ego.  The inquisitor is well aware of thisÑwith his sharp knife he draws forth the ego from its hiding place in the body as skillfully as the surgeon draws a splinter from the eye.  Where the endurance of pain reaches a limit there the ego stands forth and pronounces that the body and the life of the body has become for it a source of terrible oppression, and so to be rid of the body becomes its sole hope.\n\nIn consequence, such a denial of the life of the body testifies to the fact that we are more than  just  our  own  body.  Within  pain,  I  will  to  be  beyond  my  body.    Human  experience  thus extends beyond the body and discovers the ego at the core of consciousness.  For we fear first and foremost not the cessation of the life of the body, but the life of the ego.  I might lose a part of my body, but so long as I remain, I feel somewhat satisfied.  On the other hand, the loss of the life  of  the  egoÑthinking,  hoping,  judging,  etc.,  appears  to  me  as  a  far  deeper  and  more penetrating death.  I might accept the death of the body coupled with the continued life of my ego, but never the death of the ego coupled with the continued life of the body. From this we might conclude that although the body is first on the order of experience, the ego is first on the order of consciousness.\n\nRecognition of the separate life of the ego implies an act on an entirely different order.  Such recognition implies not only awareness of self in the sense of self-awareness, but recognition of the whole order of the self.  The ego must, in a way, extricate itself from the life of the body in such a way that, even as it is tied to the body, it views the body and embodied experience as if from above.  That such a higher standpoint of consciousness is possible is evident from the fact that, even as we undergo an experience, we may view that experience objectively, as though an outsider.    I  might  warm  my  hands  before  a  fire,  or  feel  the  cold,  powdery  sensation  of  snow. Alternatively, as I experience warmth and cold, I may likewise stand apart and examine myself experiencing.    From  this  latter  perspective,  the  ego  disengages  itself  from  the  undergoing  of experience and now views its own body and embodied experience as an object.  Within such a state we might speak of the ego as itself disembodied insofar as it no longer properly undergoes as  embodied,  but  as  though  apart  from  it.    This  conscious  act  according  to  which  the  ego\n\nseparates itself from the life of the body is here called reflection .\n\nIt is important to note that although we use such terms as disembodied, disengaged, outside, apart, independent, isolated, etc., all in reference to the reflecting ego, the ego is never properly speaking separate from the body.  Such terms apply not to the substance of the ego but instead to the perspective according to which the ego views itself.  As will be explained further below, the ego is not an independent entity but a relational focal point within consciousness.  Although we never discover this focal point directly within consciousness, experience is nonetheless referred to  that  focal  point  in  each  case  and  for  this  reason  we indirectly know of our own ego.  Still more, through the act of reflection, the ego stands apart as though separate from the body in the sense that we cease to undergo, cease to be within the immediacy of experience and now view experience as a relation.  We dialectically separate what belongs to the ego from what does not belong to me and from this obtain a standpoint for assessing what is proper to each.  From this, a new  recognition  and  judgment  follows,  and  it  is  through  this  judgment,  as  will  be  seen,  that metaphysics finds its foundation.\n\nTaking into account the separate life of the ego, it is plain that experience is never just of an array of impressions falling upon a hollow wooden horse, as Plato once recognized. 21 Such  a view  implies  the  absence  of  any  unifying  principle  at  bottom  to  this  encounter,  and  so  the absence of the ego as one who abides along with and as an inherent condition of experience.  It further brings to mind the projector.  A projector projects an image upon the screen.  The images themselves are posited outward, in a purely object-oriented perspective.  But the projector never internalizes the perception of the image.  The image is but a mere projection and the projector the medium  for  it. On  the other hand, every experiential encounter with being involves internalization of that encounter.  There is added to the encounter the subject and ego, as one for whom there is said to be an encounter.  In a word, what has been projected upon the screen of consciousness is internalized from the perspective of the ego itself.\n\nNow every  identifiable  object  of  experience  is  brought  forth  from  within  and  out  of  the whole background of our encounter with being as such.  On the other hand, that whole is never in\n\n21 Plato, Theaetetus 184d.\n\nitself  given  as  object,  but  is  at  best  only  implicit  within  any  one  encounter.    We  obtain  in consequence a specific restriction.  Experience of an object involves always an encounter with some determinate object.  This is evident in our normal everyday dealings with entities.  As I walk along the streets of New York, I encounter people, cars, buildings, clouds, the sun, and so on.    In  each  case,  my  relationship  to  the  objects  of  this  experience  arises  according  to  the restriction that I encounter some determinate object or finite collection of objects.\n\nA second restriction presents itself.  Every object of experience involves a relation to me as the experiencing subject.  Take the following example.  My intention this evening is to go to the theater. IÕm late and now searching for me keys.  The keys were in my pocket but are now gone. Here we might of course imagine that by some miracle my keys have vanished into thin air, but naturally the thought of such a possible transgression of the physical laws of nature never occurs to me.  I am instead immersed in the embodied experience of searching for my keys.  I go into the bedroom, look beneath the couch, on the table and then finally, turning toward the door see my keys sitting within the keyhole.\n\nAt which point, we might ask, am I not in this encounter?  As I recall each moment, I first discover myself fiddling for the keys in my pocket, then I am looking in the bedroom, searching beneath the couch, looking on the table, and finally at the door.  So we might confidently assert that  every  object  of  experience  is  an  object  that I encounter.    What  comes  to  the  fore  is  a relationship with being wherein the subject, the I and ego, plays a definitive role.  The relation is likewise a product of the fact that within the experience of object, the ego subsists as an essential principle and condition so that we might say that someone encounters something .  Inasmuch as that someone is in each case both you and I, to that extent every encounter is an encounter for some I.\n\nWe obtain then two distinct restrictions with respect to the encounter with being qua object of experience.  First, I can only directly encounter some one object or collection of objects but never the whole, and so never the whole of being as such.  In effect, the horizon of my encounter with being qua object is limited.  For in any attempt to encounter the whole, e.g., extending the perceptual horizon of observation so as to include the complete domain of perceptual and indeed conceptual  (as  limited  by  time  and  the  succession  of  thoughts)  experience  within  a  single comprehensive  glance,  I  inevitably  lose  sight  of  both  being  and  I.    In  further  extending  the horizon of observation, what remains is just an indefinite continuum from which all nature and\n\ndifference has been evacuated.\n\nSecond,  the  encounter  with  being  is  here  further  restricted  to  my  ego,  as  an  inherent condition for every encounter.  This implies that every encounter with being is thereby rendered a being for me, and in general, a being for someone.  For this reason, relational ontology speaks of  the  object  of  experience  in  each  case  according  to  various  relational  descriptors,  viz.,  as  a showing,  an  appearing,  a  phenomenon,  presentation,  representationÑobject.    That  which appears,  appears  for  another.    What  shows  and  presents  itself,  shows  and  presents  itself  to someone. In effect, as the ego plays an integral role in every experiential encounter with object, to that extent the ontological status of the objects of my experience may be determined according to the mode of being-given .\n\nWe thereby first encounter being according to the transcendental determination that being is a datum in the sense of the object of experience.  From the perspective of experience, being is given to me qua object.  As noted, the whole of being can never be known as object.  For as I expand the horizon of perception or conception, I encounter some one object or union of objects or  succession of objects but never the whole.  It in turn appears that an encounter with being apart from the subject is excluded from the realm of experience as such.\n\nOn the  other  hand,  if  we  consider  the  subject  not  as  an  a  priori  transcendental  condition governing experience but only as establishing specific restrictions with respect to experience qua consciousness of experience, then we obtain a distinct basis for understanding the precise nature of the being of this encounter.  I know being according to the restriction that being is given to and for me.  Being as such must in some sense be contained within the encounter according to this restriction.  On the other hand, in dividing representation and thing itself as Kant has done, the immediate result is that being for me and being as such become entangled within phenomenal experience,  according  to  the  form  of  being-given.    Things  themselves  inevitably  become  the realm of that of which there is no encounter, as it were, a world of objects without relation and so without reference ( noumena ).\n\nOn the other hand, every object, insofar as an object is given, includes within itself being according  to the above  restrictions. If  the  being  of  my  experience  were  nothing  but representation, then the relation of being-given would be unknown to me.  I would know only object as a pure immediacy collapsible into and indistinguishable from my own subjectivity.  But I can in fact recognize, identify and differentiate the relative parts within the relation that holds\n\nbetween subject and object and such recognition must be due to the fact that being as such is in some sense given within being-given.  Through reflection just such a relationship is revealed and in  consequence  we  are  able  to  distinguish  what  belongs  to  the  subject  from  what  belongs properly to object of my encouner and hence to being.\n\nV\n\nThere is a second mode of encounter with being.  For example, before walking downstairs, I am certain that the floor will be there and that my feet and my body are there.  I have likewise a sense that the being of the living room, the couches, the windows, the doors and so on are all there.  Of course, this recognition that being is there before I encounter being for the most part goes  unheeded.    In  the  main,  I  go  about  my  daily  activities  in  the  assumption  that  there  is something.  I pour a cup of coffee or a glass of water or wine, turn on the television, read a book. I  have  no  interest  in  the  possibilities  at  ground  to  my  every  encounter  with  being  or  in  the previous encounter that has just occurred.  I talk and laugh and drive to work and am in general preoccupied, without being preoccupied with being, but nonetheless always immersed within the abiding recognition that being is there.\n\nWhat is this recognition?  It would be incorrect to suggest that when I do not experience an object that, as my missing keys, it simply ceases to be.  To the contrary, whenever I experience an  object  there  is  implicit  within  this  experience  the  fact  that  something  else  is  there  in  the background to my encounter with being, so that I am confident that when I turn elsewhere, I will turn to and encounter some other thing.\n\nBut how do I know that being is there if I never have any direct encounter with the whole of being?  There would appear to be a distinction between the kind of recognition that I have within the immediate here and now encounter with the givenness of being and the abiding recognition that being is there in the background to my every encounter.  Evidence for this arises from the fact that at any moment I may consider some particular aspect of what it is that I am now doing and there arises from this a reflective recollection of that aspect of my body in its engagement as if from before.  For instance, initially I do not notice the low hum of the air conditioner in the background until another points this out to me.  Following this, I realize that although I was not explicitly  aware  of  it  at  the  time,  I  was  somehow  ÒawareÓ  of  the  hum  in  another  way.    This\n\nmemorial understanding that reveals to me that being is there within the background to my every encounter I term ÒmindfulnessÓ.  We might say that whereas awareness applies to the explicit here and now encounter with object, mindfulness implies recognition that being is there prior to (in the order of experience) any such encounter. So even as I encounter a part of being from the perspective of being-given, I am nonetheless mindful of the whole of being in the background to that  encounter.    Still  more,  although  I  am  the  one  who  is  in  each  case  mindful,  mindfulness extends beyond me insofar as it involves recognition of being prior to any encounter with an object where being and I necessarily stand within the restrictions of the relation of being-given.\n\nBut in what way do we here speak of an encounter with being through mindfulness?  What serves as the basis of this encounter?  Here the answer appears evident: mindfulness is related to embodiment and my being embedded in the body.  For instance, I may be caught within the moment, swimming in the ocean, immersed within each stroke, the proper draw of each breath. Although I am not explicitly aware of it, I am yet mindful of the presence of the being of my whole body, of the body of water that surrounds me and of the ocean that surrounds this body of water, and so on.  Immersed in the life of the body I am already in the world ( Inderweltsein ), as Heidegger early recognized. 22 I  am  mindful that being is there because I am immersed in the body and through the body immersed within the world of embodied beings.  Through my body, I further  lay  possessive  claim  to  the  being  of  my  experience  and  call  it  Òmy  ownÓ.    From  this perspective, we encounter being according to the second mode of being-mine .\n\nThis second mode is readily seen in the example of poverty.  The ancient Greeks were aware of  the  power  of  poverty  understood  according  to  a  more  universal  sense.    Within  PlatoÕs Symposium and indeed the whole of Platonic thought we see a fundamental opposition between need  and  expediency  where eros is  brought  forth  from  their  admixture. 23 Likewise  within AristophanesÕ Plutus ,  the god of wealth is there represented as blinded by Zeus so that he will abstain from awarding riches only to the just and those deserving but instead, indiscriminately, as fortune would have it.  When Plutus is later given sight and the once impoverished but now rich Athenians rejoice in their wealth, Penia, the goddess of want and poverty, enters upon the scene to  scold  them  and  to  re-mind  them  of  their  true  place  in  existence.    She  censures  them  in attempting  to  drive  her  out  and  asserts  that  their  well-being  in  fact  depends  upon  her,  further\n\n22 See the first part of Martin HeideggerÕs Being and Time (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1962).\n\n23 Plato, Symposium , 204d-209e.\n\nasserting  that  she  is  the  sole  cause  of  all  their  blessings  and  that  their  safety  depends  on  her alone. 24 In  turn,  through  wealth  we  become  forgetful  of  being,  but  through  want  we  remain mindful that being is there.\n\nPoverty involves an encounter with being as a whole.  Through poverty being is brought forth from the perspective of lack.  This instills value in being, which serves to reveal the more concrete dimensions inherent in transcendence.  In a state of poverty, I recognize that being is there through the possessive relations that hold between myself, my body and other things.  I am mindful that I abide in a place of lack with respect to the being that is there, which I am in need of and yet do not possess.  Within this state of lack, I further come to know of the meaning of want.    Poverty  inflicts  suffering  upon  the  individual  and  the  need  for  that  which  is,  exerted through  poverty,  in  turn  determines  that  the  being  of  my  encounter  is  a  fundamental  reality. There  is  an  encounter  with  hunger,  exposure  to  the  cold  of  winter,  famine,  the  demolition  of hopes,  the  injustice  of  an  early  death.    In  poverty,  I  encounter  being  as  a  whole  through  the privation and the need to possess being.  Being in turn stands forth as that which is, in relation to me, according to the perspective of being-mine, which is to say, in the potency for appropriation and possession.\n\nTwo further points follow from this.  In the first place, the mode of being-mine is expressed through the mode of being-given even as the former involves a more primordial mode of being in relation to things.  This is evident from the fact that immersion within the body implies that at every  moment  I  am  never  just  somewhere  but  always  here  now.    This  is  the  constitutive condition of the relation that holds between being and I through the body.  Through the body, being is likewise and during each waking moment given to me.  So whether or not I explicitly pay attention to this givenness, I am nonetheless bound to the here and now being of my body so that I am always caught within the temporal passage of sensing, feeling, perceiving and so on. Mindfulness  in  turn  subsists  and  indeed  persists  throughout,  as  a  principle  at  bottom  to  this givenness.  In effect, as being-given serves as an explicit and we might say, actual encounter with being, mindfulness and being-mine expresses always the potency for an encounter.  The two are likewise interwoven into my every experiential encounter, so that at each moment, as being is given to and for me there is also mindful appropriation of being there in the background.\n\nIn the second place, the science of being demands objectivity with respect to the study of\n\n24 Aristophanes, Plutus , 467.\n\nthat  which is.  By objectivity is meant a subject-less account of being, as it were, being apart from any relation to a subject.  On the other hand, the modes of encounter thus far examined, viz., being-given and being-mine, each involve definite restrictions with respect to the encounter with being.  For being-given, the two restrictions are that being is always encountered in part and for me.  For being-mine, the restrictions are that being is encountered as mine and according to the potency of being for me.  As relational, however, the analysis of being according to the above modes  and  restrictions  cannot  serve  as  the  basis  for  the  science  of  being,  which  requires objectivity, and so belong instead, in the main, to relational ontology.  As will be seen, however, a third mode of access to being does indeed present itself.\n\nAlthough ownership is expressed through mindfulness and being in the body, it is important to note that the body is not and cannot be the principle of ownership itself. This is evident from the following argument: Every relationship involves at least two terms where the terms themselves must be differentiable, dependent and non-reducible. So in the relation of Motherhood, the term ÒmotherÓ  is  clearly  differentiable  from  ÒdaughterÓ  (or  ÒsonÓ)  and  the  two  terms  are  likewise dependent in the sense that neither has independent meaning or sense apart from the other. So too,  neither  term  is  reducible  to  the  other,  i.e.,  being  a  mother  cannot  be  reduced  to  being  a daughter and vice-versa. On the other hand, if the body is the principle of ownership, then such relational structures inevitably fall apart. So ownership is itself a relation between an ÒownerÓ and the ÒownedÓ. As the principle of ownership, the body becomes the owner. But the body is likewise an object owned, viz., ÒMy body is my ownÓ. So then the body becomes both owner and  owned  and  the  two  terms  are  each  reducible  into  one  another  such  that  both  become undifferentiated. In effect, for the relationship of ownership there must be some other basis and principle of ownership itself. That principle we here identify with the ego.  Indeed, the ego is never owned by another but is always that which claims ownership over all other things to which it stands within such a relation.\n\nFor  this  reason,  we  call  the  ego  the  focal  point  of  experience  and  have  furthermore distinguished the embodied from the disembodied state of consciousness.  Within the embodied state, as above noted, the ego is immersed within the life of the body.  The ego experiences the\n\nworld as a body in relation to other bodies.  This follows from the fact that within the embodied state,  although  we  may  speak  of  awareness,  we  cannot  speak  of  any  clear  separation  and isolation of self and other, I and world and in general, what belongs properly to me and to being apart from me.  Instead, the ego experiences from the perspective of the body, wherein self and other merge into one.  Although there is a sense of property and ownership, the reference to the ego is thereby muted,  and appropriation passes from  one  body  to another within the intersubjective domain of shared (embodied) experience.\n\nWe  likewise  think  and  feel  within  the  embodied  state.    We  want,  hope  for  and  form judgments and in each case these acts are embodied in the sense that they relate to the life of the ego immersed within the body.  Within the embodied state, we speak of being in the world, of being in relation to other bodies, and so on, but we do not yet interpret experience as a specific encounter  for  I.    Recognition  of  being  as  an encounter instead  demands  explicit  reflective recognition of the relation that holds between being and I, which is never understood from the perspective of my being embodied.\n\nFrom the embodied state, we must therefore depart, through reflection, into the disembodied state  of  consciousness.    As  disembodied,  we  immediately  take  up  our  position  as  if  one  step removed from the body and perceive, to use LockeÕs description,  Òthe  operations  of  our  own mindÓ. 25 In other words, we now view our own conscious acts as objects as well as the relation that  holds  between  these  acts  and  the  associated  objects  toward  which  these  acts  are  directed. Within  the  disembodied  state,  self  and  other,  I  and  world,  emerge  in  dialectical  opposition. Subjectivity  and  objectivity  are  torn  asunder  so  that  the  ego  now  views  the  world  from  the perspective  of  an  opening  formed  between  the  two.    Still  more,  as  disembodied,  the  subject views even itself as object insofar as its own acts, originally embodied, emerge from and as an integral part of this relation, according to the modes of being-given and being-mine.\n\nThrough reflection, the embodied relations that hold between being and I rise to the surface and  are  made  known  to  me. 26 For  this  reason  and  from  this  perspective,  we  might  initially conclude with Descartes that the ego is nothing but these acts, as it were, a res cogitans.  But such a conclusion is at best premature.  Within the embodied state the ego is dispersed into the\n\n25 John Locke, Essay Concerning Human Understanding II.1.4.\n\n26 It  is  a  mistake  to  see  reflection  as  a  purely  intellectual  act.  Reflection  is  an  act  of  consciousness  and  so  may likewise have more emotive sources at bottom to it, for instance, in the despair of depression, the loss of a loved one,\n\nintersubjective  relations  that  hold  between  itself,  the  body,  and  being  in  the  world  of  other bodies.  On the other hand, within the disembodied state, the reflecting ego now sees itself as an object, and by this is meant that the ego views itself in and through its own embodied relations. In effect, the ego knows itself as a relational focal point only.  Despite this, as reflecting, the ego no longer experiences through its body but now views itself and the body as an object that is adjudicated  to  be  Òfor  meÓ  and  Òmy  ownÓ.    A  chasm  is  thereby  created  between  subject  and object, but the chasm is likewise mediated by the ego inasmuch as the ego is at bottom the focal point of the encounter.\n\nJust as the embodied state has its own acts of thinkingÑwanting, feeling, judging, etc., so too the disembodied state has analogous species of acts as the result of reflection.  The primary difference is that within the disembodied state, the ego is no longer immersed within these acts so  that  subject  and  object  are  merged  together,  but  instead  the  ego  now  views  every  object objectively.  By way of analogy, no longer immersed within the stream of experience, the ego views its experience at a distance, as though from a small vessel gliding along the surface.  The ego furthermore views the objectivity of every object along with the relations that hold between itself and each object and so views its own subjectivity within that relation.  As reflecting, I am no longer caught within the immediacy of pain or pleasure.  Instead, I view myself as feeling and I view my own pain as a felt object.  The same may be said for perception, thinking, wanting, and so on.  Of course, each act is still undergone and indeed experienced, so that the ego can never truly separate itself from the body and embodied relations, for which reason we call the disembodied  ego  a  relational  focal  point.    Despite  this,  through  reflection  we  obtain  a  new vantage point for the consideration of experience, viz., experience itself becomes for the ego an object that stands over my ego, and in such a way that the totality of experience is brought to the fore.\n\nAs reflecting, the ego now considers being as an encounter according to various standpoints. So  the  ego  may  observe  this  encounter  in  either  the  objectivity  of  its  being-given  or  in  the subjective  appropriation  of  being-mine.    In  doing  so,  the  ego  may  further suspend  judgment regarding this undergoing and simply observe the play of this encounter as it unfolds. 27 But the ego may also take a different direction and standpoint with respect to the encounter with being.\n\nfear of death, the will to nothing (in suicide), or in moments of guilt and sorrow where the ego reflectively looks upon itself in horror.\n\nRather than observing and suspending judgment, the ego may instead assent to  that  encounter through an act of judgment.  It is  from  this  latter  perspective,  from  an  assent  and  subsequent reflective judgment (reflex judgment) that a unique encounter with being comes to the fore so that  the  ego  may  now  assert  not  only  that I  encounter x ,  but  still  more  that x  is .  We  note  the radical  distinction  between  these  two  assertions.    In  the  first  place,  whereas  the  subject  is necessarily included within the former encounter, within the latter reflex judgment, there is no such inclusion of the subject.  In effect, the assertion becomes subject-less, as it were, devoid of any relation to a subject, and yet it is truly an encounter with being from the perspective of the subjectÕs knowledge of that which is. 28\n\nAn illustration will help to further reveal this distinction.  Yellow light extends, as a halo round the small office within which I now sit.  I do not yet regard the source of this light.  I am nonetheless mindful of the presence of something within the background.  When I thereafter turn to this source, I see a lamp, and may further consider the lamp according to any number of its categorical features and properties.  So I might consider its color, size, figure or even its parts, as the conical lampshade that tapers off into a metallic finial top.  I might further consider where the lamp is and the distance that separates it from my own body.  In each case, I consider something about my encounter with the lamp and indeed the relational structures that hold between being and I. So too, from the perspective of these relational structures, I recognize that the lamp is for me and is an encounter that is in some sense my own.\n\nBut in reflection, I might also pass into consideration of the fact that the lamp is not-mine according to another sense, viz., that as I look away, the lamp passes off into the background and I lose sight of it.  Despite this, the memory of the lamp is still retained and as I view the halo of light emitted within the room, I now consider the lamp as a being that can be encountered and in general from the perspective of the potency for an encounter.  In once again returning to the lamp I now regard the lamp, not just from the perspective of a being that can be possessed but instead as  now  a  being  that  is  given  in  an  explicit  encounter.    In  other  words,  the  potency  for  an encounter has been actualized in an encounter with the givenness of the being of the lamp as\n\n27 Here of course we have in mind the phenomenological epochŽ.\n\n28 Regarding this  reflex  judgment,  otherwise  known  as  the  judgment  of  existence,  Gilson  writes,  ÒIn  order  to  go further, another class of judgments is required, namely, those by which we state that what the thing is, actually is, or exists.  Such is the composite operation which we call the judgment of existence.  By saying that x is , we mean to say that x is a certain esse (to be), and our judgment must needs be a composite operation precisely because, in such\n\nobject.  In further considering the being that was only potentially mine with the being that is now given  in  an  actual  encounter,  I  dialectically  separate  and  differentiate,  judging  that  something about the lamp is not-mine, viz., the being of the lamp. From this, the reflex judgment follows that as not-mine but as now for me the lamp must stand in some sense on its ownÑ the lamp is .\n\nInitially, the reflex judgment might appear to follow from the factum of the lampÑso that the existence of the lamp is known only as a propositional encounter. But it is important to note this difference: the reflex judgment does not follow from the lamp as a factum that I encounter, but the factum of the lamp follows from an encounter with the existence of the lamp.  Through reflection, the dialectic that emerges involves analysis of identity and difference.  In particular, in the  first  dialectical  movement,  the  lamp  is  not  immediately  given,  but  remains  in  potency through  mindfulness  as  a  being  that  I  might  appropriate  within  an  explicit  encounter.    In  the second movement, turning to the lamp, that potency is now actualized and the being of the lamp is encountered in act.  In the third movement, these two prior movements are compared and from this  the  reflex  judgment  is  formed, x  is .  It  is  only  after  this  that  the  judgment  may  be  further qualified, viz., x is in fact there . 29 We accordingly conclude that it is not from the factum of the lamp that the recognition of existence arises, but instead being is that which can be encountered and so recognition of existence arises from the capacity to be, coupled with the act of being, and hence from a comparison and judgment.\n\nOf  course,  the  reflex  judgment  here  does  not  penetrate  into  the  very  focal  point  of  this encounter.    For  this,  further  metaphysical  analysesÑreason  and  inferenceÑare  required  that extend beyond the scope of this present investigation.  Nonetheless, what is here discovered is unqualified  being  as  such.    This  follows  from  the  fact  that  through  reflection  coupled  with judgment there is an encounter with being in the sense of assertion of the existence (esse) of the object of my encounter.  Still more, the knowledge of that which is here transcends the relational structures inherent in subjectivity and being in relation. We in turn discover that metaphysics is possible as a science, nor does subjectivity stand in the way as an obstacle hindering this science. To the contrary, subjectivity coupled with reflection and judgment serve as the door into being and it is through this door, coupled with the desire to know, that further metaphysical inquiry into the nature of being as being finds its point of departure.\n\ncases,  reality  itself  is  composite.Ó    Etienne  Gilson, Being  and  Some  Philosophers (Toronto/Ontario:  Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies, 1952), 187-188.\n\n29 In other words, ontological truth trumps propositional truth.",
