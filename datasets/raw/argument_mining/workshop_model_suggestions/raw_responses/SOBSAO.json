They\n\nFrequently however, even still, consequentialism is attacked on the grounds  that there   would be bad consequences if people explicitly thought in terms of how to maximize the when deliberated about how to act. Such complaints are not wrong much as misdirected It may be that, as some have claimed, it makes no sense to sharply separate truth-makers from decision procedures in practical matters. Or it may be that consequentialism an account of the truthmaker is sorely lacking  But criticizing consequentialism as a decision good they\n\n- I gratefully thank Rachel Cohon, David Justin D'Arms, Janice Dowell, Geoff Himes Ted Hinchman, Dan Jacobson; Doug Lavin; Mark LeBar, Loren Lomasky, David Schmidtz, David Velleman, Mike Weber, and Matt Weiner for their help with this articleam also grateful for helpful comments from anonymous associate editors of this journal.

Our decision procedures will, of course, be restricted by our capacities. But if a criterion becomes too remote from our capacities; it will cease as a criterion Bernard Williams earlier had suggested that a radical split between truth-maker and decision procedure can create problems for utilitarianism.

Rather, my is to offer a persuasive interpretation of what such accounts are accounts of:. This interpretation; if correct, reveals some criticisms of such views to misunderstand the views being criticized. Indeed, if my interpretation is correct; it seems that some proponents of the view also have not appreciated properly their own view. The failure to understand what subjectivist accounts of reasons for action are accounts of has impeded a fair assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of such views. goal goal\n\nIn this article I will argue that the most prominent subjectivist accounts of reasons for action are, like consequentialism, best understood as accounts of the truth-maker in a certain domain. are not in the first instance recommendations about the kind of reasoning that ought to be going on in peoples heads. Further, as with the case of consequentialism, the failure to appreciate that such accounts are accounts of truth-makers and not decision procedures has misled some of our best philosophers, most notably Christine Korsgaard, into criticisms that similarly fail to make contact with the views mean to address. They they\n\nMany contemporary proponents of subjectivist accounts of wellbeing have followed the consequentialists lead, advancing their views as accounts of the truth-maker of individual well-being rather than as methods of discovering it. As with consequentialism; such an approach provides the best interpretation of what subjectivist theories of well-being are theories of.\n\nFor reasons that are not clear, proponents of subjectivist accounts of reasons for action have not explicitly adopted this approach. Nonetheless, I will argue that just as consequentialism and subjectivist accounts of well-being are best interpreted as offering truth-makers rather than methods of discovery, so subjectivist accounts of reasons are best under-\n\nCambridge University Press; 1973], P. 135) . This is apparently held to be bad news for the thesis of utilitarianism As we will see later, if Williams's argument here was utilitarianism (as I think it is not) , it might be that Williams's own view of reasons would fall prey to the same sort of argument. telling against\n\nFew influential consequentialists have failed to notice that consequentialism is much better fitted for the role of truth-maker than decision procedure. among others, J S.

Henry Thinking\n\nstood as offering truth-makers for claims about what we have reason to do, rather than accounts of how to discover what we have reason to do.\n\nTo make out this case, I will at times draw parallels between subjectivist accounts of well-being and reasons for action. I do so because the most influential views of these sorts share common crucial feature. They both require that we be factually informed, or at least not factually misinformed, before allow that our proattitudes determine our wellor reasons for action. This is true of Hume's and Bernard Williams's accounts of reasons for action and for a long line of subjectivist accounts of well-being: These subjective accounts share the important that the factual information require may be impossible for actual agents to get. Further;, even when the required information is possible to get, it may yet be that the agent had no reasonable grounds to suspect it was worth the getting. Thus proponents of such accounts are not claiming that sensible deliberation would involve gathering all the information that the epistemically idealized agent would have. they being point they\n\nThis difference between an account of rationality and an account of reasons for action may sound trivial, but it is not. Subjectivist accounts of well-being or reasons for action are not relativized to our epistemic\n\nThis by itself shows that these accounts are not about how we ought to proceed in everyday life when we have to make a practical judgment. offer an account ofwhat makes it the case that one has more reason to rather than + or that it is better for to % rather than +. But are not claiming that a need be irrational or imprudent for failto act as she would had she known such facts. A person might do the best that could reasonably be asked of her by way of investigating such matters and still fail to learn the truth about her well-being or reasons for action Such a person should not be thought irrational or imprudent for acting on such justified but mistaken beliefs. Thus, I will be claiming, the famous Humean instrumental account is not best understood as an account of rationality at all. It is an account of the truth-maker of claims about an agent's reasons for action\\_ They they you person ing failing\n\n3. It might seem that Iam treating the fact that an account is epistemically relativized as criterial of its being decision procedure. And this would be problematic since it seems that versions of consequentialism that morally require us to maximize expected (rather than actual) value could nonetheless sensibly claim to be accounts of the truth-maker of moral claims despite being epistemically relativized But notice that my case hinges on claiming that the fact that an account is not epistemically relativized shows that it cannot sensibly be thought to be an account of the proper decision procedure. I can allow that some epistemic relativization is possible in some accounts of truth-makers and merely insist that the lack of epistemic relativization in is incompatible with interpreting the to be an account of proper decision procedures for finitely rational creatures like ourselves. must here resist the temptation to argue that the seeming plausibility of the version of consequentialism that recommends the maximization of expected utility is itself partly the result of the confusion between truth-makers and decision procedures. I thank an anonymous referee for urging me to be clearer about all this theory theory\n\n464\n\npredicament. Rather specify an ideal epistemic vantage and claim that our subjective reactions from that vantage determine our well-being or reasons for action. Accounts of rationality or prudence should be epistemically relativized .

Because of these differences, claims about rationality are typically best fitted to be claims about appropriate decision procedures and claims about reasons are typically best fitted to be claims about truth-makers. they point point get. special\n\nThis article will have two sections. In the first, I distinguish an account of reasons for action from an account of rationality: I claim that prominent subjectivist accounts are best understood as accounts of reasons and not of rationality  In the second section, I will examine how accepting the claims of Section against Humean instrumentalism offered by Korsgaard.\n\n## I SUBJECTIVISM: DECISION PROCEDURE OR TRUTH-MAKER\n\nThis section of the article will have five subsections. In subsection A 1 distinguish accounts of rationality from accounts of reasons. In B, I consider the accounts of Hume and Bernard Williams and argue that are best read as accounts of reasons and not accounts of rationality. In C, briefly argue that the failure to attend adequately to this distinction between reasons and rationality can also be found in the work of prominent subjectivists such as Richard Brandt. In D, I consider the parallel development of subjectivist accounts of well-being: I try to show that speaking of subjectivism about well-being and reasons for action in one breath, as I have been is justified. Finally, in subsection E, I consider what the subjectivist should have to say about the relationship between reasons and rationality: they doing,\n\n## A. A Parallel with Theoretical Rationaliy\n\nA person who is theoretically rational, I presume, adjusts her degree of confidence in a proposition to reasonably reflect the evidence for and against it. In some cases theoretically rational also involves seeking out data for or beliefs and perhaps even creating new data. The being against\n\n4. Allan Gibbard, Wise Choices; Apt (Cambridge, Mass. Harvard University Press, 1990), p: 18, makes a comparable distinction. He writes that one problem for any 'full awareness account such as Brandts is that rationality; in the ordinary sense, often consists not of using full information, but of the best use of limited information\\_ Acting in full awareness of all relevant facts suggests not rationality, but something more like 'advisability' . Whereas rationality is a matter of making use of the information one has, advice can draw on information the advisee lacks. See also pp. 89-92. Feelings making\n\nimportant here is that a person could be theoretically rational to believe proposition P; and yet P might be false: Sometimes the evidence that even conscientious striving allows us to can be misleading: To be theoretically rational in one's belief formation, therefore, does not preclude fallibility in one's beliefs. point gather\n\nRationality (or prudence) in practical matters seems quite similar to theoretical rationality in the above respects. A practically rational person is someone who processes the available information in reasonable ways in deciding what to do, not the person who happens; perhaps luckily; to act in the way that she had most reason to act.5 There are two things an agent might accomplish: (1) processing information and gathering information in sensible ways and (2) acting in the way that she has most reason to act. We call people practically rational to the extent that are successful in the former rather than the latter. The former accomplishment concerning invoking sensible decision procedures best corresponds to the way want to use the term rationality; as we will see in the following example: they we\n\nFurther; we cannot simply discover who is theoretically rational by seeing who holds the greatest number or proportion of true beliefs. A theoretically irrational person might nonetheless get lucky in that many of her unjustified beliefs turn out to be true. There are two things an agent might accomplish: (1) processing information and gathering information in sensible ways and (2) believing the truth. We evaluate people as theoretically rational or not in the ways satisfy the former requirement rather than how they fare with respect to the latter requirement. If the world cooperates then people who do well at the former will often do better at the latter\\_ But the world to so cooperate does not make reasonable decision procedures unreasonable\\_ they failing\n\nImagine that has carefully solicited advice from financial exdiversified portfolio. Let me stipulate that Sally has admirably investigated how best to invest her money in the way most likely given the information available at the time, to result in a comfortable retirement. Fred, on the other hand, has another retirement plan. He, like Sally, very much cares to have enough to live comfortably after retirement. But Fred decides to invest only a dollar in his retirement plan and powerball lottery ticket with it. The lottery works like this. Each person, whether the ticket or not, is assigned a number. Then a number is randomly drawn so that the winning number is determined to anyone investin the lottery; If a person purchases her number for a dollar then, if her number has been drawn, she receives enough money at retirement to be comfortable. Fred his number, puts the ticket in a drawer, and Sally buy they buy prior ing buys\n\n- 5 Of course we might also call someone practically irrational on the grounds that she does not act in accord with her sensible deliberation.\n\nconfidently awaits a comfortable retirement despite his knowing that the odds are 800,000,000 to 1 his winning: against\n\nBut this is not the most natural way to use the term 'rationality:' Most of us would say that Fred was irrational in counting on comfortable retirement yet got lucky and that Sally made rational decisions with her money but got unlucky: In speaking this way we tie rationality to the folof a reasonable decision procedure rather than acting in ways that in fact best further our In this sense a person could be rational to engage in activities that do not turn out for the best, perhaps because bad luck sometimes keeps the best plan from working better than bad lowing goals. plan.\n\nSuppose further that Freds number has been drawn to his buying the ticket; although he has no way of knowing this. Suppose also that Sally's carefully thought out investment scheme will lose her money as a result of unforeseeable and unlikely changes in the world economy What should say about the rationality of Sally's and Freds retirement schemes? We could say that Fred had a genuine reason to play the powerball (after all this will get him the money he so covets) and that since his action is in fact effective in realizing this important goal, his action is rational. Sally has a genuine reason to not invest her money: So she acted for a reason that was not a real reason and hence, we could say, is irrational.  We could say all this, tying the notion of rationality to acting in ways that in fact promote one's goals. prior we\n\nIf we want to be able to say that Sally invested rationally and Fred irrationally, then the Humean account of what agents have a reason to do is not an account of rationality: What is frequently called the Humean instrumental account of rationality is no account of rationality at all.\n\nAlthough we do not want to call Fred rational, we do want to allow that there is something to be said for his buying the ticket. Fred would certainly want to the ticket if he fully appreciated the truth of the situation. That he does not appreciate the truth does not mean that these attractive features disappear. This is clearest when a person requires inaccessible information to see the best causal to achieve a given end. Assuming the end to be uncriticizable; surely we want to say that the agent has a kind of reason to take the path that in fact will best further her aim, even when the agent herself lacks grounds for buy fully path good\n\nWe must further distinguish between choosing the act that rational decision procedure would recommend and actually invoking a rational decision procedure. When we merely act in conformity with the conclusions we would have reached had we deliberated rationally; let us say one makes a rational choice. Thus one might make a rational choice by sheer luck. When one makes a rational choice because one engaged in sensible deliberation, let us say one acted rationally: Thus only evaluanother as acted rationally commits us to a positive evaluation of the actor's decision procedure. ating having\n\nsuspecting that this action is the true means to her end. It is this kind of reason for action that is the topic of the theories of Hume and Williams. so I will argue in the following section. Or\n\n## B. Hume and Williams\n\n## David Hume wrote that\n\nme at a distance, and thro' mistake I fancy it to be pleasant and delicious. Here is one error choose certain means of reaching this fruit; which are not proper to my end. Here is a second error; nor is there any third one that can ever possibly enter into our reasoning concerning actions.\n\nFor Hume it would seem that our actual desires could mislead us into action that we have no reason to take. This is the case with the son who wants the fruit and takes effective means to it, yet finds it disagreeable. Hume wants to say that a passion must be accompany'd with some false judgment; in order to its unreasonable; and even then not the passion, properly speaking, which is unreasonable, but the judgement' (p. 416). According t0 Hume, passions are original existences, not attempts to accurately map or represent aspects of the world. Passions, on this view, cannot be true or false. per being 'tis\n\nFor Hume, \"Reason is the discovery of truth or falsehood' (p. 458) Thus, passions cannot directly be contrary to reason. Rather, 'passions can be contrary to reason only so far as are accompany'd with some judgement or opinion\" (p: 416). Thus; if there is, as Hume claims there is, the possibility of errors in \"our reasonings  concerning action' (p. 460), will have to result from errors of fact or inference that affect our wants . they they\n\n6. David Hume, A Treatise of Human Nature; ed. L. A Selby-Bigge (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1967), P. 460. This formulation is clearly better than the comparable one Hume offers at Treatise; P. 416, where he writes; \"Tis only in two senses that any affection can be call'd unreasonable. First, When a passion, such as hope or fear, or joy despair or security; is founded on the supposition of the existence of objects; which really do not exist:. Secondly; When in exerting any passion in action, we chuse means insufficient for the desig' d end, and deceive ourselves in our judgment of causes and effects \\_ This formulation of the former error is inferior because it fails to allow room for cases in which the object that is the foundation of our attitude actually exists, but, ifwe brought it nearer or had firsthand familiarity with it, we would alter our attitude. This is exactly the possibility that the later formulation allows. Further page numbers in the text refer to Hume's Treatise. grief\n\nSome modern interpreters of Hume have claimed that his view is that no action can be contrary to reason. Hence rather than really the founder of Humean instru mentalist accounts, he was a full-fledged skeptic about the powers of reason to have anything at all to say about action. See Rachel Cohon, Hume and Humeanism in Ethics, Pacific Philosophical Quarterly (1988):99-116; and Elijah Millgram, \"Was Hume a Humean? = Hume Studies 21 (1995) 75-93. Korsgaard concurs with the picture of Hume as a radical skeptic about practical reason and, for that matter, theoretical reason; in The Normativity being\n\n## 468 Ethics\n\nOne can read Hume as claiming that an action nonculpably based on a false factual judgment is still contrary to reason\\_ Evidence for reading Hume this way is that Hume claims that the errors that lead us to act contrary to reason might well be unavoidable\" (p. 460) and manner of upon the person who is so unfortunate as to fall into them= (p. 459) . He thus implies that there may well be no reliable method of learning the truth in the situation in which the agent made her mistake. Thus, on this way of reading Hume, he must think that we can do the best that we can in deliberation; given our epistemic circumstances; yet fail to discover our true reasons for action. This can happen guilt\n\nWe suppose, in wanting the fruit, that it will be pleasant to taste or that it will have a particular familiar taste. The belief is false Thus we have a criticism of the agents action. It rested on a false belief and without that false belief there would be no desire the fruit. Hume's example makes clear that it is reasons job to discover phenomenological facts as well as propositional facts. for\n\nThe above reading of Hume, it will surely be noted, develops a criticism of acts and passions that Hume himself found 'figurative and improper. He wrote that these false judgments may be thought to affect the passions and actions, which are connected with them, and may be said to render them unreasonable in a figurative and improper way of speaking' (p. 459) . This warning about improper ways of speaking, it seems to me, is meant to remind us that desires and actions that are misdirected by false judgments still lack representative value and so cannot themselves be true or false and therefore cannot literally, for Hume, be contrary to reason 8\n\nIf we appreciate what the fruit really looks like, tastes like, and so on, and still want it, and furthermore if we take steps that are effective in satisfying our wants, then our action cannot be contrary to reason. Acts, for Hume, are contrary to reason, albeit indirectly and in an 'improper way of speaking, when the act is motivated by a passion which would not exist (or; presumably, would be significantly altered) except for misinformation. On this reading of Hume it would be natural for him to say that one acts in accord with reason or one has a genuine reason to % when one's motivation to % is not based on some such misinformation.\n\nNonetheless; Hume clearly understood and felt the temptation to call acts or passions based on false beliefs contrary to reason. Suppose we want to understand the sort of criticism that Hume seems to level against\n\nof Instrumental Reason, in Ethics and Practical Reason, ed. Garrett and Gaut Cullity Berys\n\n8 It would have seemed open to Hume to claim that acts or passions that would only result from such false judgments are themselves defective on grounds other than that are false. they\n\nacts or passions based on false beliefs that is, the criticism that Hume himself finds figurative and improper. This criticism, I argue, is closer to the criticism of something one has no reason to do than the criticism of being irrational. being\n\nWilliams explicitly adopts and extends Hume's account of reasons for action. Williams claims that one only has a practical reason to % if one would arrive at a proattitude towards by proper deliberation. The boundaries of proper deliberation; according to Williams; are vague but not hopelessly so. Williams; like Hume, holds that it is not the case that just any of an agents concerns provide that agent with reasons for action because of elements in S [the agents subjective motivational set] based on false beliefs. 10 Thus, for Williams; proper deliberation involves disabused of false beliefs and, one would suspect, sup plied with unknown truths.'1 Williams also allows further and more creative roles for proper deliberation as well.12 being being\n\nFurther, it is this \"figurative and improper\" criticism of actions that Williams means to be building on in constructing his Humean account of reasons for action. 9 Modern Humeans have tended to fix on and develop Hume's 'figurative and improper\" criticism of acts and passions not because think that passions or actions can be true or false but because think that reason can do more than discover truths and falsehoods. Modern Humeans suppose that practical reason can also recommend an act on the grounds that it would serve one's authentic ends. When Ispeak of Hume's account of reasons for action, I am assuming this more expansive understanding of reason than Hume himself allowed. they\n\nWilliams does not explicitly require that the agent know all truths; but rather seems more concerned that the agent not have falsehoods affect her choice of actions. In a wide array of cases the latter requirement really encompasses the former. For in many cases a person might\n\n9. It is worth noting that it must also be this \"improper understanding of Hume that Korsgaard is working with when she writes; in The Normativity of Instrumental Reason, p. 228, that Hume does explicitly allow that actions can be irrational in two derivative ways: we act 'irrationally' when our passions are provoked by non-existent objects; or when we act on the basis of false causal judgements I take it that Korsgaards use of the word \"derivative and her putting in scare quotes 'irrationally signals that she is trying to uncriticism of acts and passions amounts to.\n\n11. Williams, 'Internal and External Reasons, p. 104.\n\n10 Bernard Williams, Internal and External Reasons, in his Moral Luck (Oxford: Oxford University Press; 1981), P. 102. Michael Smith's notion of proper deliberation in The Moral Problem (Oxford: Blackwell, 1994) is quite similar and explicitly builds on Williams's account. However , Smith claims that desiring to get Xafter proper deliberation only provides one with a reason to get X if all rational agents would converge in their desires. Smith also argues that we have good reasons to expect such a convergence [argue both of Smith's claims in \"Do the Desires of Rational Agents Converge?

Of course the agent might only have assumed that Ywas unlikely; which could be true. However; it is hard to believe that Williams means to make much of this latter sort of possibility: It would be odd, to say the least; to require that the agent know that Ywill occur when the agent believes that it will not, but to not require the agent to know that Ywill occur when the agent only believes that Yis unlikely.\n\nAn agent can fail to act for a genuine reason in this sense even though she did not engage in or stupid methods of deliberation and information gathering. Hume's fruit-fancier and Williams's petroldrinker acted contrary to reason. But for all we know these characters might have engaged in perfectly reasonable methods of deliberation. sloppy\n\nWilliams offers the following example: The agent believes that this stuff is gin, when it is in fact petrol. He wants gin and tonic. Has he reason, or a reason, to mix this stuff with tonic and drink it? Williams acknowledges that we speak both as if the agent did and did not have a reason to drink.  Williams tells us that in the explanatory sense, which is concerned with understanding why the agent acted as he did, the agent surely did have an intelligible reason to do what he did. But in the justifi catory sense, which is his concern here, Williams suggests the agent did not have a reason to mix the stuff with tonic and drink it.13 I think Williams's understanding of this case is somewhat He wants to allow that the agent that drinks is rationally relative to his false beliefs. Thus there is not only an explanation of his drinking but a kind ofjustification as well. I think Williams should say that the agent is justified in drinking in that it is rational for him to do so but not justified in that there is no genuine reason for him to do so. faulty. acting\n\nHume and Williams offer, in the fruit and petrol examples; cases in which people take actions that do not have genuine reason to take. The of these examples is to provide a clear case of an agent acting contrary to reason in the relevant sense and show why such actions count as contrary to reason from the of view of their theory: Yet Hume and Williams give us no grounds to suspect that the agent's decision procedures in these cases were improper; no reason to suspect that unwisely given their situation '4 Why is all such information about the gullibility or carelessness in the way these individuals formed their point point they acted\n\n## 13 Ibid , pp. 102-3.\n\n14. Williams, in rehashing the petrol example, remarks that \"we are allowed to change that is, improve or correct his beliefs of fact and his reasoning in saying what it is he has reason to do. Our license for doing s0 does not stem from the agent's poor use of available information but rather from the thought that \"what he wants is a drink of gin and tonic. See 'Internal Reasons and the Obscurity of Blame, in his Sense of Humanity (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; 1995) , P. 36. Making\n\nbeliefs left completely unspecified? Because, I submit; such information is irrelevant to the question that Hume and Williams are interested in, which is whether or not these people really had a reason to do what did. The issue of the reasonableness of the decision procedure employed in these cases is not under examination and irrelevant to the question at hand. they\n\nAssume for a moment that I am wrong and Hume and Williams are offering of rationality: might Hume and Williams think that the fruit-fancier and the petrol-drinker are acting irrationally? Obviously the only sensible answer would have to involve the unjustified nature of the beliefs that the agents had. But then our attention in the above examples should crucially be directed to the distinction between justified and unjustified beliefs. Acts based on justified belief, even if the belief is false, are not thereby irrational. Hume and Williams, however, far from focusing on the unjustifiability of the agents' beliefs; give us no information about the justifiability of the agents' assumptions. Can we imagine that the only in these cases which is relevant to the ratioof the agents action, namely the justifiability of the agents beliefs, was nonetheless forgotten when these philosophers offered canonical statements of their accounts of rationality? theory Why thing nality ~\n\nHume simply says that the choosing of means which are not efficient in producing the wanted end is an error that can lead us to act contrary to reason. Williams tells us that elements in our subjective motivational set which are there thanks to false beliefs do not give rise to real reasons. Neither Hume nor Williams finds any reason to investigate into the grounds of these false beliefs. Some false beliefs are justified. Others are not. But this distinction is treated by both philosophers as irrelevant.\n\nWilliams allows that the agent that drank the petrol and tonic would be \"relative to his false belief; rationally \" 15 Thus Williams thinks there is a kind of commendation of the agent that drinks the petrol. But it is also clear that Williams thinks that there is something to be said against the action. Williams's attention is on the attempt to understand the sense in which the agent in the case has no reason to drink the The fact that we cannot criticize the deliberation as irrational drops from sight in Williams's discussion. All the attention is on understanding what counts as ideal deliberation (which obviously can involve knowing facts that we were excusably unaware of) and the connection between one's motivations after ideal deliberation and one's reasons for action\\_ acting petrol agents petrol.\n\nThe deliberation that Williams claims can close the gap between our current motivations and our genuine reasons is deliberation that, in many cases, we are unable to carry out in the actual world. Often, for example, the relevant facts that one would have in ideal deliberation\n\nhave not yet been discovered.  Additionally, the deliberation that Williams thinks can close the gap will in cases be deliberation that it would be impractical for actual people to pursue To think otherwise is to require rational agents never to trust that previously reliable sources of gin contain gin but instead to thoroughly test each beverage for authenticity to drinking. many prior\n\nThere is room for subjectivists to disagree about the vantage from which one's proattitudes determine one's reasonsThus it is not necessary that a subjectivist accept a 'full information' account of reasons or well-being in which the deliberating agent knows all of the facts. However; I do suppose throughout that the most plausible subjectivist account would have to require that the agent deliberates in the light of information to which she may lack epistemic access. point\n\nWhatever the merits of their proposals, Hume and Williams are to capture the sense of a reason to % in which one might retrospectively say of onself; \"I had a reason all along to % and didnt realize it or have any reason to suspect it until now. We do as ifwe could have had a reason to % all along even though we did not have any information that would have made % a sensible choice at the time\\_ Their question is not 'is it reasonable for A to believe that she has a reason to 4\" but rather what makes it the case that A has a reason to %. hop ing having speak\n\nIdo not claim that Hume Williams always clearly had in mind the interpretation 1 have offered of their writings or that there are no parts of their thinking that are in tension with my interpretation. 16 Rather, I want to claim that this interpretation is better able to capture and express the bulk of their concerns than an interpretation that took them to be offering accounts of decision procedures. I claim that their accounts are best understood as accounts of an agent's reasons for action and not accounts of practical rationality: and\n\n16. Williams, in \"Internal and External Reasons, P. 103, writes that the internal reasons conception is concerned with the agent's rationality: Additionally; Williams confusingly writes that A may be ignorant of some fact such that if he did know it he would, in virtue of some element in S, be disposed to %: we can say that he has a reason to %, though he does not know it. For it to be the case that he actually has such a reason, however, it seems that the relevance of the unknown fact to his actions has to be fairly close and immediate; otherwise one merely says that A would have a reason to % if he knew the fact\" (p. 103). I think the last claim here shows that Williams is sometimes incoherently trying to straddle the line between an account of reasons for action and an account of rationality. But even here note that Williams does not require that the unknown fact be one that the agent was in any sense culpable for not knowing: Hume writes, 'A person may also take false measures the attaining his end, and may retard, by his foolish conduct, instead of forwarding the execution of any project\" (p. 459). The word foolish here is troubling for my interpretation. It is also very awkward in Hume's context. In this and surrounding passages, Hume stresses merely the truth or of the judgment, not its wisdom or stupidity. It is not at all clear why Hume thinks he has earned the right to call such \"false measures foolish rather than merely mistaken. Not all mistakes are foolish, and he tells us nothing about this false measure that helps us see why it counts as foolish. for falsity '\n\nWilliams, it must be conceded, is arguing in the first instance for internalism rather than subjectivism. \"The internalist view of reasons for action is that this formulation provides at least a necessary condition of its true that A has a reason to Ã¸: A has a reason to % only if he could reach the conclusion to % by a sound deliberative route from the motivations he already has. 17 This formulation leads to two ambiguities Ineed to briefly address. being\n\nTracking internalism holds that one's informed proattitude toward Ã¸ing is similarly just a reliable to one's reasons, not what makes it the case that one has a reason to %.19 It is thus compatible with objectivism rather than subjectivism about reasons for action.

Darwall briefly notes this ambiguity in the latter discussion. are\n\n19. Michael Smith's account of reasons for action in The Moral Problem is best understood as a version of tracking internalism. He thinks that the desires of all ideally rational agents converging on certain things is necessary and sufficient for our having reasons; and, in particular, reason to do what we would so converge on. But, according to Smith, the best explanation for such convergence, if it occurred, would be that there are extremely unobvious a priori moral truths\" (p. 187) . On his view; it is these truths that make it the case that we have reasons to do certain things and our ideally informed deliberations simply gets our motivations to track these truths. The view Peter Railton offered in 1986 also looks to be tracking internalism rather than truth-making internalism. See his Facts and Values , Philosophical Topics 14 (1986): 5-29, P. 25, and Philosophical Review 96 (1986): 163-207, pp. 175-76, n.17.\n\nthis context; is a thesis about what makes it the case that one has a genuine reason to %. If an account claims that the answer to this question is not to be found in the agent's contingent proattitudes; it counts as version of objectivism: On the other hand, truth-making internalism embraces the subjectivist's claim that what makes it the case that one has a reason though Williams's defense of internalism is compatible with either the subjectivist or objectivist interpretation, he is clearly much more inclined to embrace the subjectivist interpretation.\n\nRather we should read Williams to mean, by the requirement that one could reach the conclusion to % via a sound deliberative route, that further, more ideal deliberation would not upset one's conclusion to case does one's conclusion to % count as such that it could have been reached via a sound deliberative route\\_ Cases in which adding some true, but misleading, beliefs would create a motivation to that would be undone by further acquisition of truths would not count as such as could have been reached via a sound deliberative route\\_ being being\n\nSecond, Williams writes, \"A has a reason to % only if he could reach the conclusion to % by a sound deliberative route from the motivations he already has. 20 Suppose one started out without a certain bit of true information and without a proattitude toward Ã¸ing: Suppose further one that bit of information and as a result one had a proattitude toward Ã¸ing; Is this sufficient to say that the agent reached the conclusion to % by a sound deliberative route? I think clearly not and that Williams is committed to thinking s0 as well. Williams is interested in claims about one's reasons that are not epistemically relativized. This is why he announces that one has no reason in his sense to drink the gin and petrol without adding an epistemic qualifier: gained\n\nFinally, there is one more problem with Williams's account I must briefly mention It is clear that the idealization process of our mistaken beliefs undone can turn an agent into someone whose wellbeing and reasons for action differ from those of our actual misguided selves. Presumably the fact that I have gained a bit of information will typically make it the case that it is no longer for me to have that bit of information brought to my attention and that I have lost my reason to seek out that bit of information. But the fact that my factually informed self has bits of information does not take away my reason to learn that fact, despite its being the case that presumably my idealized self does lose any motivation to again be presented with or research that fact. Alternatively we could focus on cases in which the idealized agents broad experience has caused her to develop a delicacy of taste that the actual agent lacks. having good\n\nIf we are to look to the idealized version of ourselves to determine our well-being or reasons for action we must take care lest aspects of our well-being or reasons that are due to our nonidealized agents get lost. We are not interested in the well-being or reasons of the informed version of the agent. Rather, it is no doubt best to think of the idealized agent as an advisor 21 This keeps front and center the thought that it is what the informed agent has to say about desirable ways for the uninformed agent to live that we are interested in. 22 being fully\n\nThis points to a problem with Williams's account of reasons for action.  Williams seems to suggest that it is the desires that the informed agent would have for   herself, rather than the advice that the informed agent would have for mere mortals, that determines  the agent's reasons. And this is bound to lead to a mistaken view of the reasons for action of nonidealized agents such as ourselves. In subsection D we will see that in the well-being literature a plausible method of allaying this problem has been developed.\n\n## C. Brandt\n\nIn an attempt further to illustrate that there has been confusion in the literature between reasons and rationality; even amongst chief advocates of subjectivist accounts, I will briefly to the case of Richard Brandt. He does not distinguish adequately an account of reasons from an acrationality and this creates problems for his view: However, my chief example of a case in which this confusion has created real trouble will be the case of Korsgaard that will concern us in Section II point\n\nBrandt writes, \"I shall pre-empt the term rational' to refer to actions;, desires, or survive maximal criticism and correction by facts and logic, and later, this whole process of confronting desires with relevant information; by repeatedly representing it, in an ideally vivid way, and at the appropriate time, [ call cognitive psychotherapy. 23 Even with this minimal description of cognitive therapy it is plain that one could be blameless from the standpoint of rationality andyet still fail to act as one would want to act after it. It is not irrational to fail to read all the latest health journals. Thus it must not be irrational to act in light of the best information one can arrive at withpsycho-\n\n- Railton seems to have initiated this way of thinking of the ideal deliberator: See his \"Facts and Values,\n\n23 Richard Brandt, A of the Good and the Right (Oxford: Clarendon, 1979), pp. 10 and 113. Theory\n\n22. Although such a picture would produce a more adequate account of reasons for action, it would falsify Williams's version of internalism and his explanation condition. Or so I argue in my Explanation, Internalism, and Reasons for Action, Social Philosophy and Policy, vol. 18 (Summer 2001). There I argue that the best subjectivist account of reasons for action must reject Williams's understanding of internalism as well as his claim that \"ifit is true A has a reason to %, then it must be possible that he should for that reason\" (Williams, Internalism and the Obscurity of Blame, p. 39) \\_\n\nout reading all the latest health journals. Nonetheless; one's failure to read all the journals might result in one making a choice that one would not have made had one read all the journals. Cognitive psychotherapy is insensitive to the costs of getting information and deliberation. In this sense it seems best suited to be an account of the truth-maker rather than a decision procedure. Thus it would seem that the topic of Brandts account was an account of reasons rather than rationality.\n\nNow this is confusing: If Brandts targeted notion was our notion of rationality, then cognitive psychotherapy should not involve knowledge that it makes no sense to try to collect. But if his targeted notion is our notion of a reason, then he should not limit the information to the possibly false beliefs of the best science of the The fact that the science of the has not discovered that smoking causes cancer does not affect the fact that there is a reason for me not to smoke based in the fact that smoking has this effect. Thus Brandts cognitive psychotherapy does not capture our notion of a reason or rationality. Sometimes he was tempted to construct his theory as if it were an account of reasons (as when he requires that we deliberate in light of information that it might be prohibitively expensive to In other cases he constructed his account as ifit were an account of rationality (as when he relativizes the information in best explanation for the awkward combination is that Brandt did not keep clear the distinction between rationality and having a reason. day get) . used\n\nBut then, surprisingly, Brandt limits the information that cognitive psychotherapy would give us to available information\\_ The information that counts as available for Brandt is the propositions accepted by the science of the agent's plus factual propositions justified by publicly accessible evidence (including testimony of others about themselves) and the principles of logic. 24 Brandt explicitly notes that available information in this sense need not be true. It could also be information it would be intolerably expensive to so that trying to it might itself be irrational.' 25 day get get,\n\n## D. Subjective Accounts of Well-Being\n\nIn the well-being literature one finds a subjectivist account that is remarkably similar to the subjectivist accounts of reasons for action considered aboveCall it the full information account of well-being: Mills\n\n24. Ibid. , p. 13\n2. 25 Ibid.\n\n26. In a conversation late in his life; Brandt told me that he regarded Railton's discussion of such issues as an improvement on his own because Railton's version of cognitive psychotherapy required all information rather than merely available information. I think this suggests that we do best to understand Brandt to have really been trying to capture the notion of a reason rather than rationality:\n\ncompetent judges test offered an early model, Sidgwick offered perhaps the first explicit formulation of the account, and Brandt, Hare, Rawls; Gauthier, Griffin, Darwall, Lewis, Railton; and Harsanyi have developed and /or endorsed the view.?7 Roughly the picture is this: getting what one wants after one has full knowledge of the options available is what makes one's life go best.\n\nSidgwick's early version went like this:\n\nA mans future good on the whole is what he would now desire and seek on the whole if all the consequences of all the different lines of conduct open to him were accurately foreseen and adequately realized in imagination at the present in time. 28 point\n\nBut Sidgwick's version above quickly runs into difficulties. Consider that our informed and rational self would never want more information for herself but we are firmly convinced that it can sometimes be intrinsically in our interests to information. Further our better selves doubt have a refined palate and may well highly value expensive complex wines that taste just like the cheaper stuff to us. It is implautell the difference (assuming that it is only the taste of the expensive wine which causes our idealized self to it over the cheaper stuff ) . 29 The idealization process turns us into such different creatures that it would be surprising if the well-being of the two of us; my informed self and my ordinary self, consisted in the same fully gain no prefer things.\n\nIn response to problems such as these, Peter Railton has revised the account proposing that an individual's consists in what he would want himself to want, or to pursue, were he to contemplate his present situation good\n\n27.

Sidgwick, pp. 111-12 Robert Shaver, 'Sidgwick's False Friends, Ethics (1997) 314-20, helpfully reminds us that Sidgwick ultimately qualified this view in a way that limits its claim to being a subjective account. I dispute Shaver's further claim that Sidgwick had reason to so qualify his view in my \"Reply to Shaver, in the e-journal BEARS, http:/ / good\n\nI take this example from Griffin's Well-Being; P. 11.\n\nfrom standpoint and vividly informed about himself and his circumstances; and entirely free of cognitive error or lapses of instrumental rationality 30 fully\n\nThe adoption of a 'wanting to want' framework neatly eschews the implausible identification of interests between our informed and our ordinary self while retaining the insight that the advice of someone who has this fuller information, and also has the deepest sort of identification with one's fate, is bound to have some commending force. 31 Thus the sort of improvement Railton makes on Sidgwick's suggestion is just the sort of fix for the problem with Williams's account of reasons for action\n\nWith an agents well-being it is clear that the best forms of deliberation available to us when making everyday decisions do not assure us of understanding which option would be best for us.

Having a normative reason, on the other hand, seems to have both an epistemically  relativized sense and nonepistemically   relativized sense Thus confusions can and do arise. But when we see that Hume and Williams are best seen as pointing toward the latter sense we see that here too the account is of the truth-maker and not of a decision procedure.\n\n## E. Trying to Put Reasons and Rationality Back Together\n\nNo doubt it is sometimes the case that the account of the truth-maker in a domain can also plausibly serve as an account of the appropriate deci sion procedure for discovering the truth in that domain. 34 This might happen when the account of the truth-maker does not require extra human capacities. But the accounts that subjectivists offer do not suggest ideals of deliberation that it makes sense to try to approximate or that we might call someone prudent or rational to the extent that approximated. It would make no sense to randomly as many facts as possible, no matter how esoteric, before practical decisions: tual agents such as ourselves often must make decisions quickly, without crucial bits of information, and in the heat of the moment. Further we they gather making\n\n33 A recent criticism of such accounts is that there are serious conceptual difficulties in attempting to specify the fully informed vantage point. See my Full Information Accounts of Well-Being, Ethics 104 (1994): 784-810; and Rosati, Persons, Perspectives, and Full Information Accounts of the GoodSuch complaints retain whatever force have full information accounts of well-being when deployed against full information accounts of reasons for action. they against\n\n34 Kant claimed that \"in studying the moral knowledge of ordinary human reason we have now arrived at its first principle.

Yet the relationship between the categorical imperative and an approved decision procedure available to nonacademics seems obscure. Some have sugto me that the common thought of \"What if everyone did that? might count as invoking recognizably Kantian thought as part of one's decision procedure.

In fact it is as interesting as the question of what actual policies the consequentialist ought to recommend after she convinces herself that morality requires us to maximize the In both cases, the fact that of the work of figuring out what must do if we are to act for our true reasons or to act morally remains to be done even after accept such theories does not, by itself, constitute an objection to such theories.

Taking such into account will necessitate that the proper decision procedure involves heuristics and rules of thumb.35 The subjectivists account simply abstracts away from such problems. These added complexities in everyday deliberation make the subjectivist's account a silly model to try to approximate when making practical decisions. good things\n\nThese considerations so far highlight the lack of connection between a subjectivist account of the truth-maker of reasons and an acinteresting connection between reasons and rationality: I will here canvass three attempts to such an interesting connection. I will be doubtful that any of these links can be sustained. forge\n\nFirst, one could offer a connection of the sort that Michael Smith champions. 3 Smith offers an interesting proposal that attempts to forge formal link between rationality and reasons. He offers a vantage alleged to be ideal for deliberation about one's reasons. He then claims that if from that vantage one would want X for one's nonidealized self; then one has reason to get X. He also claims that if one believes that one would so want X from his vantage point; then one is irrational to not desire X Thus the connection between reasons and rationality would point point\n\n35 . Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky have written much about actual human heuristics and biases. See esp. Kahneman, Slovic, and Tversky, Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1982) Such heuristics and biases will, of course, sometimes lead us to contrary to our genuine reasons but this is not sufficient to show that adopting them as part of one's decision procedure is irrational. It would be a drastic mistake to reject all such heuristics and biases on the grounds that even the best are fallible. act\n\n36. Smith, The Moral Problem; PPp. 177-80. Gauthier (p. 31), in passing, also supports such a view.\n\nbe that if 0 is the case one has a reason to act in a certain way. If one believes that 0 is the case one would be irrational to not act in the way one would have reason to act if 0 were the case.\n\nThis seems to involve the tacit assumption that one cannot rationally reject the thought that one has reason to if one would want to from Smith's vantage Smith writes; \"Suppose we believe that we would desire to % if we were fully rational and yet fail to desire to %. Are we irrational? We most certainly are\\_ And by our own lights. For we fail to have a desire that we believe it is rational to have 37 But why is the agent irrational by her own lights in this scenario? She would be irrational by her own lights here only if she accepts the thought that it is rationally required for her to desire as her informed counterpart would have her desire. Smith tacitly assumes that she accepts this thought. If she rejects this thought;, however; then she is not irrational by her own lights to fail to desire to % in the above scenario. Further, an agent clearly can sensibly reject the thought that she is rationally required to desire as her fully informed counterpart would have her desire. point. fully\n\nAlternatively, Smith could claim that although an agent can ratiodispute that her wanting to % from Smith's vantage gives her reason to want %, she is nonetheless irrational if she believes that she would so want % and does not therefore want %. But how can this be? If she is indeed rational in doubting that her wanting to % from Smith's vantage signals that she has a reason to %, how can it be thought to be necessarily irrational for her to combine a belief that she would want to from Smith's vantage with a failure to be motivated to %? If nally point point point\n\nIndeed it seems to me that Smith 's view here confronts a dilemma. Smith could either say that no one can rationally dispute that one has a reason to % if one would want it in the relevant way from the vantage Smith describes. Once we remember that one can rationally dispute the truth of a claim even in a wide array of cases in which that claim is true, any plausibility to this thought evaporates. In order to disagree, Smith would have to argue that he has some sort of guarantee that no thought that disputes his above claim can even meet the standards of rationality. This would be bold stuff indeed.38 point\n\n38. David in \"Belief, Reason, and Motivation: Michael Smith's The Moral ProbEthics 108 (1997): 33-54, offers comparable considerations Smith. Copp considers Smith's attempt to insist on an identity between (1) thinking one has a reason to and (2) thinking one would be motivated from Smith's vantage to %. persuasively argues that even if there were an identity between Smith's problem. Even if Clark Kent is Superman we are not rationally required to treat them as the same person unless available evidence rationally requires us to believe that Clark Kent is Superman. Smith needs the identity between 1 and 2 to not only be true but to play a role in the agent's mental economy: Smith at least needs the claim that one cannot rationally reject the thought that 1 is identical to 2 and not merely the claim that are identical. See pp. 38\\_43\\_ Copp, against point Copp they Copp,\n\none can rationally reject the claim that a certain consideration gives one a reason, one cannot be held to be irrational for to give that consideration weight in one's deliberation. failing\n\nSecond, one might think that necessarily there is some reliable tendency for rational deliberators to arrive at the truth about their reasons\\_ As yet I see no reason to believe this. Of course we could just define rationality as the method of deliberation that tends to lead one to the right answer about 's reasons This will be the third method of connecting reasons and rationality that I will dispute below. For now understand rational deliberation to have no conceptual connection to one's true reasons. One still might claim that apparently rational practices such as avoiding intransitive preferences or avoiding weakness of will necessar ily have some tendency to lead one in the direction of one's reasons. But consider that logically valid reasoning need not have any general tendency to lead one to true beliefs if the true premises are epistemically inaccessible. And in the case of the subjectivist's account of reasons the true premises certainly do look to be epistemically inaccessible: one\n\nSmith's case for the claim that \"if we believe that we would desire to if we were fully rational then we rationally should desire to %\" trades on an ambiguity 39 If we suppose that the agent whose reasons are in question supplies the content of 'fully rational, then the thesis is plausible but uninformative. If an agent accepts that she would want to % if she deliberated in a way that she herself accepts to be ideal, then she is irrational to fail to be motivated to %. However, on Smith's view; Smith's theory; not the agent, supplies this content. But if the content of 'fully rational' is by Smith's account of what it is to be fully rational, then the account is informative but implausible.4 This looks to be bad news indeed for Smith's claim to have solved the moral problem\" as the above equation between belief and rationality is explicitly held by Smith to be the to the problem. plausibly supplied key solving\n\nThird, one could simply define rationality or the best decision cedure as the one that best leads to one acting in accord with one's true pro-\n\n## 39.

For a fascinating discussion of the extent to which an internalist account of the truth-maker must not only specify an idealization process and claim that motivated to % from that vantage point is necessary for having a reason to % but must also ensure that the idealization procedure itself connects up with the agents concerns in the right way; see Connie Rosati's Internalism and the Good for Person, Ethics 106 (1996): 297-326. Roughly, Rosati's view can be seen as an attempt to ensure that a rational agent would be motivated by her beliefs about what she would want after ideal deliberation by allowing the agent's current concerns to inform what counts as ideal deliberation for her. Rosati calls such a view 'two-tier internalism. If Smith accepted Rosati's two-tier internalism he might be able to the connection between reasons and rationality he was looking for but per haps at the of losing the cognitivism of the view. Rosati herself tells us that her view makes room for what might be a quite plausible antirealism being get price\n\nreasons\\_ Ido not want to be fighting definitions. However, one should notice that on such a view any epistemic inaccessibility of ones true reasons will simply translate into epistemic inaccessibility in ones account of rationality: If the truth-maker is epistemically inaccessible on this view; then the proper decision procedure will also be. One could again claim to be offering merely an account of what makes it true that one is rational. But eventually surely we will want a term for saying that someone has acted sensibly or not given her epistemic situation. But this third proposal for reasons and rationality deprives us of the notions of ratiolinking nality\n\nSome have supposed that Williams offered a fourth possible connection between reasons and rationality: On this reading, Williams is claim that internalism and only internalism can ensure that ones reasons are rationally available to one. Thus it is supposed that Williams holds that on an externalist view it is possible for an agent to deliberate rationally and still be unmoved by her reasons whereas this is alleged by him to be impossible on an internalist view. 41 But this confuses Williams's argument. Williams and other subjectivists are crucially committed to the thought that an agent can deliberate rationally and yet fail to be moved by her true reasons when, for example, she excusably lacks important factual informationKorsgaard writes that 'practical-reason claims, if are really to present us with reasons for action, must be capable of motivating rational persons I will call this the internalism requirement. Although Korgaard does not directly attribute this form of internalism to Hume or Williams, she writes that the internalism requirement is correct; but there is probably no moral that excludes it. 42 But real reasons not motivate rational agents (when, e.g.excus ably lack important information) and hence Korsgaard's version of internalism is false. Further, if I am right about the best understanding of the Humean program, it claims that there are reasons for action that do not respect Korsgaard's version of internalism. The sensible subjectivist should argue that there is a crucial connection between motivated after ideal deliberation and one's reasons.43 I do not claim that the subjectivist cannot champion an interesting connection between reasons ing they theory need they being\n\n41. See Rachel Cohon, 'Internalism about Reasons for Action, Pacific Philosophical Quarterly 74 (1993): 265-88. Although Cohon (wrongly I would say) supposes that this is Williams's argument; she (rightly; I would say) sees that this purported disanalogy with external views cannot be sustained .\n2. 42 Christine Korsgaard, 'Skepticism about Practical Reason,\" Journal of Philosophy 83\n3. 43 Obviously the subjectivist does not want to suggest that there are substantive stan dards for desire that are specifiable independently from ideal deliberation (in the way that many think that truth does supply deliberation independent standards for belief) .

KORSGAARD'S CRITIQUE OF HUMEAN INSTRUMENTALISM\n\nIn this final part of the article I will try to show that the failure to keep in mind the distinction insisted on above between an account of rationality and an account of an agent's reasons and /or to see that Humeans are offering an account of the latter has misled even our best philosophers into misunderstanding the subjectivists account of reasons for action failing\n\nThis section of the article will have three subsections. Subsection A considers objections to Korsgaards critique of instrumentalism that are at some remove from the considerations raised above The of subsection A is to argue that Korsgaard does not have other good arguments against instrumentalism that are not subject to criticism for failing to appreciate what has been argued above. Subsection B resumes the main line of thought of the article by showing how what has been argued in Section I above tells Korsgaard's critique of instrumentalism. I argue here that properly understanding Humean instrumentalism as an account of reasons rather than rationality helps us see that Korsgaard's critique simply fails to make contact with such views. Subsection Cargues that, seen Humean accounts of reasons for action; we cannot successfully redeploy Korsgaard's arguments against Humean accounts of rationality: point against having\n\n## A Instrumentalism and Real Ends\n\nChristine Korsgaard's principal complaint against subjective accounts of reasons for action in The Normativity of Instrumental Reason'\" is that cannot serve as guides; that is, normative instructions that might fail to heed. This objection; if it could be successfully made out, would clearly be devastating: She writes; they we\n\nThe problem is coming from the fact that Hume identifies a persons end as what he wants most; and the criterion of what the person wants most appears to be what he actually does: The persons ends are taken to be revealed in his conduct. [This] problem would be solved if we could make a distinction between what a persons end is and what he actually pursues. Two ways suggest themselves: we could make a distinction between actual desire and rational desire, and say that a persons ends are not merely what he wants, but what he has reason to want we could make a more psychological distinction between what a person thinks he wants or locally wants and what he 'really wants \\_ But in order to distinrational desires from actual desire, it looks as if we to have some rational principles determining which ends are worthy of preference or pursuit. So the first option takes us beyond instruOr, need guish\n\nmental rationality: But really the second option\\_the claim that these people are irrational because do not promote the ends which really want' also takes us beyond instrumental ratioalthough this may not be immediately obvious. If we are g0to appeal to 'real desires as a basis for making claims about whether people are acting rationally or not; we will have to argue that a person ought to pursue what he really wants rather than what he is in fact going to pursue\\_ That we will have to accord these 'real' desires some normative It must be something like requirement of reason that you should do what you really want; even when you are tempted not to: And then, again, we will have gone beyond instrumental rationality after all.44 they they nality ing is, force.\n\nHume's case of the unappetizing fruit is sufficient to show that he distinguishes between what one chooses and one's real end. After all, the of the example is that choosing the fruit is contrary to reason because so is not efficient in achieving one's genuine ends. Hume does not say that because one chose the fruit it must be one's real end. The accusation that Hume or the Humean is saddled with a 'revealed' account of a persons wants is ungenerous and undermotivated. Hume and many of his followers instead identify an agents genuine end with what one would want after one knows the facts. accord these desires normative force: Korsgaard suggests that such a move takes us beyond instrumental rationality' because it takes one's informed wants to determine one's genuine ends and then claims that furthering ones genuine ends has a kind of normative priority over one's uninformed wants. If this does take us beyond an account of reason as instrumental, then the accounts of Hume and Williams are not instrumentalist. point doing They\n\nKorsgaard seems to suppose that once the instrumentalist has someto say by way of distinguishing real from apparent ends, that she has gone beyond instrumental rationality because the instrumentalist thing\n\nOne of Korsgaard's in this paper is to show that the inprinciples directing us to the adoption of certain ends, there can be no requirement to take the means to our ends. 45 And this contains, I think, an important truth. If the instrumentalist had nothing to say about how to distinguish one's real ends from one's apparent ends, then there could be no requirement to take the means to our real ends rather than our apparent ends. But if the instrumentalist was precluded from distinguishing real from apparent ends, then the revealed preference account that Korsgaard saddles Hume with would be just as precluded as any other understanding of an agents true ends. key goals really\n\n44. Korsgaard, The Normativity of Instrumental Reason;\" p. 230. Such claims are quickly summarized in Korsgaard's The Sources of Normativity (Cambridge: Cambridge Uni-\n\n45. Korsgaard , p. 220.\n\n## 486 Ethics\n\nwould then be forced to recommend rational principles which do not flow from the instrumental principle itself. But the instrumentalist something to say here is simply for her to interpret the instrumental principle, not to offer a second fundamental principle. The consequen tialist does not add a second fundamental moral principle when she offers an interpretation of the The thought that the instrumental principle can stand alone should not be confused with the thought that it offers normative guidance even when left uninterpreted. having good.\n\nPut another way; if Korsgaard is right that to be an instrumentalist one must forswear the project of distinguishing real from apparent ends, then instrumentalism is not a widely held view. The real interest would then be in Humean views rather than instrumentalist views. The former do allow themselves to distinguish real from apparent ends but deny that all agents share any interesting substantive ends.\n\nIn any case, we should not think anything important on how we count principles here: Perhaps some interpretations of one's true ends would violate the traditional subjectivist spirit of instrumentalism and so would interestingly take us If someone added to instrumentalism an account of an agents true ends such that necessarily all agents had the end of being moral, then the distinctive traditional subjectivism of instrumentalism would be lost:. However, Hume and Williams identify one's ends with what one would want after one knows the facts. We can call this going beyond instrumentalism if we like, but so is misleading and the interesting differences with Kantian accounts of practical rationality remain hangs doing\n\nRelatedly, it is sometimes suggested that the Humean cannot pily appeal to a differential authority between, for example, first and secorder desires. Michael Smith writes, 'For even if we assume that reason is on the side of a harmony between our first-order and secondorder desires there is simply no reason to assume that reason is on the side of achieving that harmony by changing our first-order desires to suit our second-order desires rather than vice versa On the Humean's maximizing conception of rationality it all depends on which desire is stronger. 46 The idea seems to be that the Humean may only appeal to strength of desire but never to measure of authority of desire that is not derived from strength. This is an odd attribution. For, as we have seen, a central Humean contention is that informed desires have more authority than uninformed desires. And this judgment of differential authority is clearly not derived from appeals to strength of desire. If the Humean is barred from appeals to differential authority between, for hapond\n\nHumean appealing to a differential authority between different kinds of desires. He seems unconvinced but merely concludes that the Humean would have to offer a rationale for the differential authority:\n\nexample, first and second order desires (as I say she is not) , this cannot be because the Humean has forsworn the idea of their authority to a desire that is independent of strength. being\n\nKorsgaard closes her essay claiming that only three positions are possible: either (i) the Kantian argument that autonomy commits us to certain substantive principles can be made to work; or (ii) we are left in the position of the heroic existentialist; who must ultimately define his will through acts of unconditional commitment that have no further ground; or (iii) complete practical normative skepticism is in order \" 47 But the position Ihave claimed Hume and Williams offer is none of these It supposes that there are principles that determine one's ends, but that these principles do not require us to have any particular substan tive ends long options.\n\n## B. Reasons not Rationality\n\nKorsgaard sometimes; as in the paragraph quoted above, accuses Hume of identifying an agents end with whatever he actually chooses. But her considered view seems to be that Hume does not do this. She allows that one can have, according to Hume, an end different from what one chooses in at least two ways: (1) when one's current wants are based on factual misinformation or (2) when one takes means insufficient to satisfy one's ends. 48 long\n\nKorsgaard  claims that both of these [ways in which Hume can make room for our action not the means to our end] are cases of mistake; the actions that result from them are not, strictly speaking, irrational. 49 Thus; Korsgaard is claiming that cases in which the agent is misled by false beliefs into choosing an action that she would not be tempted toward except for the misinformation are not, strictly speaking, cases of irrationality 50 being\n\nKorsgaard's considered central argument against Hume and the Humeans is that neither of these ways of one's actions coming apart from one's ends can count as an instance of irrationality. That is, suppose for the sake of argument that it is always rational to take the means to one's ends. Korsgaard's claim is that the two ways for Hume that one's act can count as not the means to one's end are such that too cannot count as irrational. Thus Korsgaard claims that Hume and the Humeans lack the resources to label any action irrational. being they\n\n47. p. 253\n49. Ibid\n3. 48 Ibid. , P. 228. Again, I take it Korsgaard's official view is that Hume thinks there is no such thing as practical reason What she says here must be understood to be developing a Humean account that Hume himself found \"improper.\n50.  Korsgaard also claims in The Normativity of Instrumental Reason, p. 220, that 'after all, a person may be conditioned to do the correct thing as well as the incorrect thing; but the correctness of what she is conditioned to do does not make her  any more\n\nFurther, Korsgaard reminds us that Hume held that the moment we perceive the falsehood of any supposition; or the insufficiency of any means our passions yield to our reason without opposition\" (p. 416).51 Korsgaard concludes that\n\nThis suggests that Hume thinks no one is ever guilty of violating the instrumental principle. Making a mistake, after all, is not a way of irrational, and Hume thinks we do take the means to our ends as soon as mistakes are out of the But this is worrisome How can there be rational action, in any sense, if there is no irrational action? The problem is exacerbated when we see that Humes view is not just that people dont in fact ever violate the instrumental principle. He is actually committed to the view that people cannot violate it.52 being way.\n\nThus, according to Korsgaard, Hume (and his followers) have no account of how an agent might act irrationally in light of the information that are aware of, and this, according to Korsgaard; is to make no room for irrationality; strictly speaking: they\n\nMost of this argument is prefigured in Korsgaard's earlier paper, \"Skepticism about Practical Reason. 53 There she wrote that \"judgments of irrationality; whether of belief or action; are, strictly speaking, relative premises are not irrational. 54 She also pointed out in the earlier paper that the two ways of one's action not the means to one's end, for Hume, look to be of this sort, that is, look to be cases of conclusions drawn from mistaken premises. 'Hume might; and in fact does; mean simply that we base our action on a false belief about causal relations. So this is no more genuinely a case of irrationality than the other [case of belief in nonexistent objects] . Relative to the (false) causal belief, the action is not irrational. Thus, the familiar conclusion: If the only possibility Hume means to be putting forward here is the possibility of action based on false belief about causes and effects, we get a curious result. Neither of being\n\nrational She also writes that 'the rationality of action depends on the way in which the person's own mental activity is involved in its production, not just on its accidental confor to some external standard\" (p. 236) . These passages make clear that Korsgaard's concern is with the agent's decision procedure, or what have been calling the agent's rationality; rather than with her reasons mity\n\np. 228\n\n51 . This additional premise is permissible if Korsgaard's argument is intended only against David Hume. But Korsgaard makes clear that she intends to be arguing with Humeans generally. Against this broader position; the use of this premise is contentious Surely most Humeans admit that Hume made some mistakes and this looks like one of them. Further, Korsgaard has not made a case that Hume's commitment to this sentence runs deep. quite\n\n53.  Korsgaard, \"Skepticism about Practical Reason.\n\n54. Ibid. , PP. 11-12. Emphasis in original.\n\nthe cases that Hume considers is a case of true irrationality: relative to their beliefs, people never act irrationally:' 55\n\nKorsgaard's central mistake in these two papers is that she fails to appreciate that Hume's account is an account of an agent's true reasons for action and not an account of rationality. Thus Korsgaard's criticisms of Hume and his followers are misdirected and leave unaddressed the Humean theory because she misunderstands what such theories are accounts of. She is correct when she writes of the sorts of cases in which Hume thinks act contrary to reason that these are cases of [factual] mistakes; the actions that result are not, strictly speaking, irrational. 56 we\n\nKorsgaard's claim that attributions of rationality and irrationality are relative to the agents beliefs seems to me essentially correct. To demonstrate that an agent is irrational it does not suffice to show that her act was based on a false belief. Attributions of rationality and irrationality are directed toward the agents decision procedure and an agent could be employing the best available decision procedure and still sometimes base her actions on false beliefs. 1 agree with Korsgaard that such cases are not best thought of as cases in which the misled but diligent agent is irrational I agree; indeed I have been insisting, that attributions of rationality and irrationality should be relativized to an agent's epistemic situation. No action is ever simply rational or irrational until we know what the actor knew or should have known. being\n\nYet such actions certainly do count as contrary to reason for the Humean.\n\nOnce we understand the Humean claims to be about reasons for possible to fail to comply with the normative recommendations of the view. Mistaken facts are, as Korsgaard says, not (at least typically)   sources of irrationality, but are all too familiar sources of failures to act as one has genuine reason to act. Korsgaard writes as if the Humean instrumental principle only sanctions the means to one's ends when one has information that reveals what the true they taking\n\nRecall that Williams, in the context of the petrol example mentioned above, allowed that the agent that drank the petrol and tonic would be \"relative to his false belief; acting rationally.= 57 This did not keep him from claiming that the agent had no reason for drinking the petrol. To make sense of this combination of claims we must understand Williams to be distinguishing rationality from an agent's genuine rea-sons\\_ His principal question concerns an agent's reasons for action and not her rationality; as is made clear by his attention riveted by what there is to say against drinking the petrol. being\n\n55. Ibid. This general thrust of this paper leans less heavily on these thoughts than the later paper. Thus I think it significantly less hurt by my case. Indeed, for what it is worth, I find the earlier paper's central convincing: points\n57. Williams, Internal and External Reasons, p. 103.\n56. Korsgaard, The Normativity of Instrumental Reason; p. 228.\n\n490\n\nmeans to one's ends are I have argued that the Humean instrumental principle is better read as claiming that have a reason to take the means to our ends whether we recognize what the true means are or not. Korsgaard's remarkably ungenerous assertion that Kant, unlike followers of Hume, recognizes that we cannot be guided by an imperative unless we can also fail to be by it\" only seems plausible if we mistakenly assume that the topic of discussion in Hume and Williams is rationality 58 As we have seen, when we properly understand the topic of discussion it is clear that Hume and Williams leave plenty of room for people to fail to act as have genuine reason to act. 59 we guided they\n\n## C. Problems for Humean Accounts of Rationality ?\n\nOne might concede that the Humean instrumental principle is an account of reasons for action and not an account of rationality; and hence concede that Korsgaard's argument leaves the Humean view of genuine reasons unaddressed, yet insist that Korsgaard's argument provides real trouble for a Humean understanding of rationality: If it were true that accepting a Humean understanding of reasons for action left one incapable of developing a compatible of rationality according to which people sometimes act irrationally, this would be a serious criticism of the Humean program. However, I unconvinced that the Humean cannot develop such an account for two reasons. theory am\n\nSecond, it would seem that Korsgaard does help us see what the instrumentalist's first line of defense should be against the charge that she cannot make room for irrational action. This would be to to the possibility of what Korsgaard calls true irrationality:' This is the point\n\nFirst, before such a line could be compelling we would need to understand what would make an understanding of rationality Humean. I challenging question. I have been arguing that Humes own writings do not provide an account of rationality; and if this is right what counts as a Humean account of rationality will involve some subtlety of interpretation. Korsgaard does not help us in this task.\n\n- 58 Korsgaard, The Normativity of Instrumental Reason; p. 238. Korsgaard, in The Sources of Normativity, Pp. 163-64, reiterates that it is impossible to violate the hypothetical imperative as the instrumentalist must conceive it and concludes that therefore the instru mental principle cannot be a normative principle.\n59. I suppose Korsgaard could continue to claim that although the Humean view understood as I describe it leaves plenty of room for us to act contrary to its recommenda tions, nonetheless it cannot serve as a useful practical guide in actual (rather than counterfactual) deliberation. My response to such a line is that this is not what the Humean view aspires to be. Perhaps it will be claimed that this very notion of a reason that might not be able to serve as a useful practical guide in actual deliberation is somehow bankrupt. I think, on the contrary, that this is a commonsense notion that we would have difficulty doing without. The comparisons I offer with the concept of well-being in Sec. I, subsection D, might be helpful here.\n\nto your end. 60 Korsgaard herself tells us that one can admit the possibility of true irrationality and yet still believe that all practical reasoning is instrumental. 61 This seems clearly correct; but it ruins the case that instrumentalists can make no room for irrational action.\n\nWhy did Korsgaard think that instrumentalism could make no room for true irrationality? It seems that there were two reasons First; she claims that an instrumentalist can have nothing to say about how to distinguish real from apparent ends. I dealt with this above. But notice that ifit were true, the instrumentalist could not label any action as irrational Or rational If we do not know what an end is, we do not know what it would be to take the means to it. It is thus unsustainable to suppose that instrumentalists held that the instrumental principle might serve as the sole principle of rationality without any understanding of what a real end is. Second, Korsgaard points to Hume's own premise that the moment we perceive the falsehood of any supposition, or the insufficiency of any means our passions yield to our reason without opposition\" (p: 416) . This does seem to rule out the possibility of true irrationality: But if a Humean abandoned this optional premise, the possibility of her cases of true irrationality is plain. Thus, Korsgaard must restrict her argument to David Hume and cannot; as was her aim, generalize to Humean accounts. 62 finding\n\n## III. CONCLUSION\n\nIn conclusion, I have argued that we have reason to reject the view that the famous Humean account is an account of rationality but that it has it that no one can ever act irrationally:  We can avoid this surprising conclusion by rejecting the assumption that the Humean account is best read as offering an account of rationality, and instead understand accounts as accounts of an agent's reasons for action good such\n\nAdvocates and critics of Humean instrumentalism have misunderstood or not fully appreciated what the account is an account of: Prop-\n\nWhen we do so interpret such accounts we can understand, as Korscould not, how the instrumental principle can make recommendations that we might fail to follow: Further, we can then understand why Hume and Williams find such an interesting connection between an agent being factually misinformed and her acting contrary to her genuine reasons for action. Finally, I have argued that Korsgaard has not made a compelling case that the Humean lacks the resources to develop an account of rationality according to which people sometimes act irrationally gaard\n\n60.
