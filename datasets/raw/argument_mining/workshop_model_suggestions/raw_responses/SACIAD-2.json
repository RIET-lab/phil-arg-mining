According to that view, the institutional life of the Society in the early  decades  of  activity  (1660s  and 1670s) was characterized by a strictly Baconian  methodology.  But  the  reconstruction of the discussions about fossils and natural history within the Society  shows  that  this  monolithic image is far from being correct.

A New Science and a New Academy\n\nUnlike  mathematics  and  astronomy,  the  study  of  the  Earth  was  not  an independent  discipline  till  the  seventeenth-century  scienti fi c  revolution. Th e emergence of a new science requires the formation of a community of researchers sharing a clearly de fi ned object and some fundamental theoretical principles guiding their work. Historical geology achieved this through a complex  process,  which  started  in  the  second  half  of  the  seventeenth century. Like other experimental sciences at the same stage, its fi eld was full of  facts  resisting  generalization  of  theories. 1 Nicolas  Steno  compared  the doubts which facts engendered to the 'Lernean Hydra's heads': dispatched one, innumerable others grew up. 2 Till then, the natural history of the Earth essentially  consisted  in  the  classi fi cation  of fossilia .  As  Walter  Charleton explained in 1668, this word denoted all the objects under the super fi cies of  the  Earth. 3 To  distinguish  the  remains  of  living  beings  from  minerals one needed a clear discrimination of the organic from the inorganic within a continuous spectrum of fossil objects. 4 But Aristotelian and Neoplatonic philosophies supported an integral identi fi cation of what we now consider fossils with inorganic minerals. An example of this view and its wide diffusion in England can be found in Edward Jorden's An Account of Natural Bathes and Mineral Waters . From 1631 to 1673 the book had four editions. In fl uenced by the Paracelsian chemist Petrus Severinus, Jorden a ffi rms that fossilia are continuously produced in the bowels of the earth, where mineral seeds are placed from the creation of the world. 5 Th is doctrine, as Th omas Sherley observes in 1672, is not new but originates from Plato, Pythagoras and Moses, and has been revived by 'the noble Van Helmont and other great wits'. Operating as ferment, the 'architectonick stonifying spirit or petri fi ck\n\nTh e research for this article was made possible through a grant from European Commission (FSE 2007-13).\n\n- 1 Cf.

Mimicking living animals and plants, this virtue produces similar but inanimate bodies within the mineral kingdom. 7 Considered as bodies of inorganic nature and origin, fossils were classi fi ed according to their external shape ( lapides fi gurati ).\n\nTh e  advent  of  the  mechanical  philosophy  o ff ered  an  alternative  view of  minerals and fossils. Assuming a corpuscular de fi nition  of  matter  and body, Steno de fi ned the question of fossils as a mechanical problem: 'a body of certain fi gure, and naturally produced, being given, to fi nd in the body itself arguments, discovering the place and manner of its production'. 8 Th e mechanical analysis carried out by Steno provided decisive arguments favouring the organic origin of fossils. Looking for the place and time of their production, he found the solution in the biblical universal deluge. 9 Behind Steno's assumption of a biblical frame for the organic theory of fossils, there were traditional principles such as the stability of Earth's morphology a ft er the Creation, and biblical chronology. Notwithstanding the re-emergence of pagan chronologies in the Renaissance, the reformed and counter-reformed biblical literalism ended up rea ffi rming the six thousand years of Christian chronology. In England, for instance, the date of the creation calculated by Bishop Ussher (4004 BC) was printed in the King James Bible, and virtually become part of the scripture. In future, only under the pressure of compelling  arguments  would  these  principles  be  questioned. 10 Steno  maintained\n\n6 Th omas SHERLEY, A Philosophical Essay declaring the probable Causes whence Stones are produced  in  the  Greater  World .

As Nicoletta Morello argued, the long prevalence of classi fi cation aims and the belief in the stability of divine creation represented an 'epistemic preconception which did not induce a search for proof of an 'order' among the fossils'. 11\n\nWithin the Baconian project of a new instauration undertaken by the Society,  Robert  Hooke, fi rst  curator  of  experiment,  pursued  the  natural history of the earth. ' Th e subject is large, as extending as far as the whole\n\nIn di ff erent ways scholars faced the di ffi culties of a science such as seventeenth-century historical geology in the early stage of its formation. English experimental  philosophers  of  the  Royal  Society  assumed  Francis  Bacon's project  of  a new natural and experimental history. In one of his baroque metaphors, Bacon argued for a philosophy that, like bees, combined the ability to acquire the essential experimental material and to elaborate theories from  it. Th e  fundament  of  Bacon's  instauration  was  a new  experimental history 'which may serve for the building up of philosophy, and embrace material tested, abundant and properly arranged for the work of interpretation which will follow it.' It is 'a labour of many working together', whose 'work and labour (especially for the gathering in of experience) can best be shared out and then brought together.' 12 Only a community of researchers could realise Bacon's project. In the eyes of many fellows, the Royal Society was, or rather had to be, that community. In 1661, Abraham Cowley called for a new 'philosophical college', where naturalists, like miners, cooperate for  the  extraction  of  natural  treasures.  Living  in  their  private  studies,  he noted,  most  ingenious  person  are  driven  to  the  'inactive  contemplation of nature', while in a new academy they would be engaged in a collective work. 13 'Solomon's  house  in  the  New  Atlantis  -  Joseph  Glanvill  wrote  in 1665 - was the profetick scheam of the Royal Society.' 14\n\nAntiquarians:  Essays  in  Memory  of  Arnaldo  Momigliano .

Only a community of scholars could have achieved it, not single men working separately. 15 For Hooke, scholars engaged in the study of new fi elds of nature like historical geology should have shared not only their ideas, but also a common programme along the lines traced by Bacon:\n\nSuch persons also ought to agree upon a method &amp; should indeavour to share the di ffi culty of the work amongst them. And unless there be such a method agreed on, &amp; that joint &amp; united indeavours be added, the work of a philosophical history cannot be thought feasible in less than many ages. 16\n\nIn spite of the numerous di ffi culties of such a plan, fellows aimed to represent the Society as the historical realization of the 'college of Solomon' that Bacon 'with all his authority in the state' could never raise if not in romance. 17 Th omas Sprat's History of the Royal Society carried out this task. Sprat's emphasis on the Baconian features of the Society did not re fl ect its real state during the early years of activity. A ft er the royal patronage in 1662, fellows aimed to show the congruence of their activities with the new political order of the Restoration. 18 Sprat, himself an Anglican bishop, portrayed the Society as a natural ally of the Crown and the Church of England, both engaged in a desperate search for stability and conformity a ft er the Commonwealth years. 19 He described the fellows as devoted to their Baconian project,  attending  assemblies  without  'confusion,  unsteadiness,  and  the little animosities of divided parties' and avoiding the 'dangers for the time past'. Th e non-confessional nature of the new philosophy, however, should not mislead, the Baconian plan of the Society supported the Church of Eng-\n\n15   Robert HOOKE, Th e Posthumous Works .

Sprat, therefore, did not maintain Bacon's fi rm separation of science and theology. 21\n\n## 2. Fossils and the Micrographia\n\nTh ese aspects of the early Royal Society in fl uenced its institutional life and had signi fi cant consequences on the study of fossils by its fellows. Th e fi rst specimen of fossils, 'a curious piece of petri fi ed wood', was presented to the Society by Jonathan Goddard. Th e same day, 20 May 1663, 'Hooke produced three  microscopical  observations.'  He  was  carrying  out  a plan  of  microscopic  observations,  and  the  counsel  assigned  to  him  the  fossil  specimen so as to observe it with the microscope. At the following meeting, Hooke showed a thin section of Goddard's petri fi ed wood, but 'he was desired to cause the same stony wood to be cut sideways, and also to bring in his observations upon it.' On 10 June Hooke's observations were read and registered. Th e  report consisted of a comparison of fossil wood with ordinary wood. It  showed that the specimen maintained the internal structure and external shape of wood. Fossil wood had the physical and chemical features of minerals, which Hooke explained by a process of substitution of the wood's particles with stony ones. From the beginning of Hooke's microscopic observations, the Society decided to publish them. 22 For most of the fellows, the book was expected to be part of the general history of Nature undertaken by the Society. As 'it was ordered' on 23 March 1664, at every weekly meeting Hooke had to read 'one of his microscopic discourses, in order to their being printed by order of the Society.' At the meeting of the council of 22 June, fellows ordered the printing of 'Mr. Hooke's microscopical observations', demanding that 'they might be perused and examined by some members of the Society.' 23 As appears from a letter written by Hooke to Boyle on 24\n\n20 SPRAT, History ,  pp.  63,  91; cf.

Woodbridge: Boydell Press 1995, pp. 178-179.\n\n23 Ibid. , pp. 397, 442.\n\nNovember 1664, the book was already printed in October but was still in the hands of several fellows examining it. 'I hope- Hooke con fi des - I shall prevail with the printer to dispatch it some time this or the next week'. 24 Indeed, the day before the council had released the book. However, the license for printing was subordinated to the presence of a dedication explaining that the Society was not involved in the theories he advanced:\n\nTh at Mr Hooke give notice in the dedication of that work to the society that though they have licensed it, yet they own no theory, nor will be thought to do so; and that the several hypothesis and theories laid down by him therein, are not delivered as certainties, but as conjectures; and that he intends not at all to obtrude or expose them to world as the opinion of the Society. 25\n\nTh e council's note shows that Hooke's Micrographia was not the book they were expecting. It was not just a book of microscopic observations, neither the initial part of the general history of Nature. In contrast with the historical limit of the Baconian method as represented by the Society, Hooke's book contained numerous hypotheses and theories.\n\nMethodology had been at the centre of historians' analysis  of Micrographia 's case within the Royal Society. 26 Th ere are documents that contain elements  making  clear  the  extent  of  disagreement  among  its  fellows,  far beyond the apologetic image depicted by Sprat. Between late June and late November in the journal book there is only one reference to Hooke's microscopic observations. It is among the entries of 24 August 1664:\n\nIt was read a paper of Mr. Hooke concerning petri fi cations, designed by him as part of his microscopical book, then in the press. Th e Society approved of the modesty used in his assertions, but advised him to omit what he had delivered concerning the ends of such petri fi cations. 27\n\nTh is brief note supplies relevant data about the origins of Micrographia . Th e reference to the stage of the publication reveals that the 'paper concerning petri fi cations' read by Hooke can be identi fi ed with a dra ft version of the observation 16 or 17 of Micrographia . Th e Society's approval of Hooke's 'mod-\n\n24 Robert  BOYLE, Th e  Correspondence .  Vol.  II.  Edited  by  M.  Hunter,  A.  Clericuzio  and\n\n25  BIRCH, Th e History , vol. I, p. 491.\n\nL.

I, p. 463.\n\nesty' in his 'assertions' and the demand to omit a part of the paper from the publication, suggests that the fellows' dismissal of Hooke's hypotheses is not only methodological. As a community of researchers engaged in an historical and experimental work, the fellows avoided appearing to adhere to any of Hooke's theories. Th e book was associated with the Society: it was written by its curator, published by its printers, composed of observations read in its meetings and registered in its journal book. But the methodology it adopted and the view of nature it supported could not be attributed to the Society itself. It is signi fi cant that this comes into focus with reference to fossils. In fact, Hooke's observations contained a general view of the Earth's history incompatible with the biblical scheme and the traditional assumptions maintained by Steno and the other defenders of the organic origins of fossils.\n\n## 3. Hooke, History and the Natural History of the Earth\n\nTh e seventeenth observation of Micrographia reproduces part of the paper read at the Society's meetings. Th e published text maintains the comparison between the organic and the inorganic features of the specimens, and extends the conclusions on the organic origins of fossils into a criticism of inorganic hypothesis. Hooke's emphasis on the structural composition of bodies,  proper  to  the  general  project  of  microscopic  investigations,  in fl uenced  fossils  observations. Th e  microscope  was  expected  to  make  visible what was supposed invisible, the 'schematismes' and 'textures' of bodies. Corporeal forms and structure were explained by the composition of microscopic 'globular bullets'. Hooke intended the Society's microscopic project as an experimental history of matter's forms. In his view, the microscope showed that the 'geometrical mechanism of nature' operates in the same way in the generation of minerals, vegetables and animals.\n\nTh e  old  idea  of  continuity  in  the  scale  of  Nature  is  assumed  here  in mechanical terms. From ' fl uidity, or bodies without any form, we descend gradually till we arrive at the highest form of a brute animal's soul'. 28 Even where  Nature  'seems  to  act  yet  more  secretly  and  farther  remov'd  from the  detection  of  our  senses',  such  as  in  the  processes  of  formation  and generation of bodies, by means of the microscope 'her working also can be\n\n28  HOOKE, Micrographia . London: s . n . 1665, pp. 85-86, 91, 114, 127; cf. Arthur LOVEJOY, Th e Great Chain of Being: A Study of the History of an Idea . Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press 1936.\n\ndetected to be mechanical'. In this matter, Hooke observed, men appealed to spiritual and immaterial principle because bare senses do not enter into the microscopic realm of bodies. But now these principles 'stand up as an opprobrium to philosophical enquiry'. Th e microscope and a belief in the gradual  continuity  of  Nature  supported  Hooke's  exclusion  of  immaterial principles from Nature: 'if we consider the progress of nature from the most simple and plain operations to the more complicated and abstruse, we may deduce from them a great argument of incouragement'. 29 Neither in living nor in mineral bodies is there a 'vegetative faculty',  an  'anima  or forma informans ',  a 'plastic  virtue'  or  a ' seminal  formatrix ',  which  gives  them structure and shape. Only mechanical and geometrical principles are the causes of the generation of bodies. 30 Th us,  the  origin  of  fossils  cannot  be but organic; their inorganic composition is due to the admission of mineral substance into the structure of bodies overwhelmed by earth:\n\nFrom all which and several other particulars which I observ'd, I cannot but think,  that  all  these,  and  most  other  kinds  of  stony  bodies  which  are  found thus strangely fi gured, do owe their formation and fi guration, not to any kind of plastic virtue inherent in the earth, but to the shells of certain shellfi shes, which either by some deluge, inundation, earthquake, or some other means, came to be thrown to that place, and there to be fi ll'd with some kind of mudd or clay, or petrifying water, or some other substance, which in tract of time has been settled  together  and  hardned  in  those  shelly  moulds  into  those  shaped substances we now fi nd them. 31\n\nAs it appears in this passage, the alterations of the Earth's morphology are the main cause of fossils. Th e vague reference in Micrographia to 'some deluge, inundation, earthquake, or some other means' is su ffi cient to show Hooke's refusal of a diluvial  origin  of  fossils  even  at  this  stage.  In  a long series of lectures delivered to the Royal Society from 1668, Hooke exposed the  de fi nitive  moving out of the biblical scheme and the challenge of the traditional  views  of  the  Earth's  history. 32 In  these  papers,  which  largely\n\n29   HOOKE, Th e  Posthumous ,  p. 47;  on  Hooke's  and  Boyle's  criticism  of  plastic  virtues  see Roberto BONDÍ, L'onnipresenza di Dio: saggio su Henry More .

For Hooke, the microscopic observations were what 'Lord Verulam call'd experimenta crucis , which serve to direct the inquirer to proceed the right way in making his judgement'. 33 In Hooke's work the experimental activity was not separated from the theoretical one. Observing fossils and comparing hypotheses on their origin were parts of the same process. Once the microscope gave the decisive proof in favour of fossils organic origin, the research was directed to inquire its consequences, both theoretical and experimental. Th us, in the geological lectures Hooke undertook the research of the causes of fossils. He distinguished the proximate causes, the agents promoting the petrifactions of the organic substances from the remote ones. 34 Only when bodies are carried under the surface of the earth, petrifactions could take place. Indeed, in Hooke's eyes the organic origin of fossils involved geological alterations of  the  Earth's morphology by means of which vegetable and animal bodies  were  placed  underground.  Fossils  become  'sea  marks  and  evidences', because they indicate the existence of past alterations of the land-sea order in the place where they are found. Th ese 'monuments and hierogli fi ck characters of preceding transactions' are document that natural historians can read to reconstruct the Earth's past. 35\n\n## 4. Metamorphoses\n\nTh e irregular disposition of minerals and the length of the biblical deluge did not support the diluvial hypothesis largely associated with the organic origin of fossils. Refusing to take recourse to Noah's fl ood, Hooke challenged the idea of an immutable stability of Nature a ft er the Creation. He clearly outlined an alternate view to the prevailing image of a static Nature. Th at image was shared both by those who refused the organic origin of fossils and also by those who defended it, employing biblical support for the deluge. Both maintained the essential stability of the Earth a ft er Noah's fl ood. Th e question  of  fossils  in  itself  did  not  represent  an  alternative  between  two opposite views of the Earth's history. Not all the advocates of the organic hypothesis were ready to accept entirely its consequences. For a long time,\n\n33 HOOKE, Th e Posthumous , p. 339.\n\n35 Ibid. , pp. 341, 411, 432.\n\n34 Ibid. , pp. 290-296.\n\nthe prevailing recourse to the biblical deluge was a way to reduce the impact of the organic hypothesis, reconciling it with the traditional view. 36\n\nSince  the  1668  lecture,  Hooke  acknowledged  the  absence  in  ancient natural history of accurate descriptions of the great catastrophes of the past. Th ese  events  were  supposed  'very  hard  positively  to  prove'. 42 Fossils  are 'monuments and hieroglyphick characters of preceding transactions of the\n\nHooke extended the historical approach from Earth history to natural history as a whole. Among fossils known there were the remains of animals that did not have correspondence with any living species. For Hooke these were remains of extinct species or represented a previous form of those still living.  According  to  his  mechanical  interpretation  of  the  chain  of  being, Hooke assumed the principle that place, time and medium produce variations in bodies. 37 'Climate, soil, and nourishment doth o ft en produce a very great alteration in those bodies that su ff er it.' 38 Th is mechanical transformism led to the acceptance of the transformation or generation of new species under the in fl uence of environmental variations. A single deluge, such as the biblical one, could not have explained such e ff ects. Th e alteration of the Earth's internal structure and super fi cial shape had been continuous since the Creation. Hooke recognized the cause of this changing system in a phenomenon still operating in  Nature,  but  in  a di ff erent  degree  of  intensity: earthquakes. 'Nor are these changes now only - he notes - but they have in all probability been of as long standing as the world.' In contrast with the biblical deluge, there is no doubt as to the 'universality of this active principle', because 'there is no country almost in the world but has been sometimes or other shaken by earthquakes, that has not su ff ered some, if not most parts of these e ff ects'. 39 Like the Earth's one, 'in the younger dayes of the world' moon's morphology has been altered by earthquakes, or rather moonquakes. 40 Th e  intensity  of  past  earthquakes  was  such  as  to  alter  the centre of gravity and magnetic direction of the Earth. Th e great mountain chains, such as the Alps, were created at the same time by the same causes. 41\n\n- 36 cf.

However, the task was not impossible. In Hooke's view, there were 'other means and assistance of information'. 43 Since  natural histories do not give any proof of the Earth's early alterations, Hooke directed his views to other ancient forms of knowledge, to those events which had happened in the early stage of the Earth, before the invention of writing. Till the time of that invention, men preserved  their  memory  by  means  of  obscure  histories  and  fables. 44 'Mythologick history - Hooke states - was a history of the production, ages, states, and changes that have formerly happened to the earth.' 45\n\nFor  Hooke,  preceding  civilizations  and  systems  of  knowledge  could have been destroyed in the early time of the Earth's morphological alterations. Hooke clearly drew these arguments from the hermetic tradition of the prisca theologia ,  but he does not seem to have been interested in Neoplatonic mysticism and theosophy. On the contrary, his interest seems only historical. 46 Th e argument of a lost 'preceding learned age wherein as many things may have been known as are now', supported the idea that despite the  evidence  of  natural  histories,  there  was  a knowledge of  early  natural catastrophes. In spite of its apparent specious character, Hooke's approach was  in fl uenced  by  Bacon's De  sapientia  veterum .  Like  Bacon,  he  believed that  mythologies  should  be  interpreted  because  their  literal  meaning  is absurd. 47 But  Hooke's  interpretation  was  based  on  the  assumption  that myths do not contain any philosophical theory, but only historical notices of natural events. In mythology he distinguished three coexisting meanings: 'a physical,  comprehending the causes, e ff ects  and  reasons;  an  historical, comprehending the times ages, persons and places; and a moral, to make them instructive and useful for the regiment and moralizing the more vulgar part of mankind.' 48 Poets employed myths 'to conceale their knowledge from the vulgar, and yet communicate it to such as had a key to unfold the mystery contained therein.' 49 But not all the fables contains a natural truth:\n\n- 43   HOOKE, Th e Posthumous , p. 411.\n- 45 Ibid. , p. 384.\n- 44 Ibid. , pp. 334, 372, 374.\n- 46 Ibid. ,  p. 328; cf .

ROSSI, Th e Dark , p. 16.\n- 49 Ibid. , p. 392.\n\nNor that I do here undertake for the truth of history in every fable, for I conceive that there are as various kinds of fables as there are of histories. Some are reputed and believed fables which are true histories, other are believed true, but are really fables; some are believed fables and are really so, and others are believed true and are really so. But of this fourth head I fear is the smallest number. 50\n\nAmong ancient mythologies, Hooke considered Ovid the depositary of all the natural knowledge of early times. 51 Th e Roman poet composed the Metamorphosis in order to transmit the oral knowledge of the early ages. Indeed, he did not conceal 'marks and characteristics by which it may be found what the history is which he doth there mythologize'. 52 Ovid assembled the history of past catastrophes and the theories of those who, like 'Orpheus, Pythagoras, &amp;c', lived 'in ages so much nearer to those more active ages of the earth'. Ovid's work, then, contained an account of the formation of the world similar to Genesis and opposite to Aristotle's notion of eternity. 53 But the analogies between ancient mythologies and the Bible do not end here. Hooke employed the same hermeneutic approach both to pagan fables and to sacred history. Ancient mythologies not only contain a description of the formation of the world very similar to the biblical one, but even references to a 'total' deluge. Th is and the other particular fl oods described by pagans were e ff ects of early earthquakes. 54 According to Hooke, a 'plain and intelligible way' to explain the fl oods and the formation of the world was possible. A physical  interpretation  of  Genesis,  avoiding  miracles  and  supernatural events, seemed to Hooke consonant with the meaning of the mythological works of pagans and the rules of Nature. 55\n\nHooke's  lectures  do not  contain  a physical  description  of  the  Earth's creation alternative to the Bible and based on the Cartesian model. Even if these events have been explained only by means of physical causes, it does not entail the exclusion of providence from history and nature. 56 Following Gassendi, Hooke distinguished the proximate natural causes of phenom-\n\n50 Ibid. , pp. 396-397.\n\n52 Ibid. , p. 406.\n\n51 Ibid. , pp. 377, 394.\n\n53 Ibid. , p. 380.\n\n55 Ibid. , pp. 313-314, 324-327, 377-378, 380-381, 413-416.\n\n54 Ibid. , pp. 328. 408, 410.\n\n56 Ibid. , p. 391.\n\nena from the remote ones. 57 'I do not conceive - he notes - it doth any way detract from the omnipotency and power of God to explain the causes that he was pleased to make praevious to those e ff ects'. 58 Natural laws depends on God, and 'the universal providence that ordereth all the e ff ects,  doth also determine and appoint all the causes and means conducing thereunto'. Indeed the contemplation of the order of Nature 'does most magnify the beauty and excellency of the divine providence which has so disposed, ordered, adapted, and impowered each part to operate as to produce the wonderful e ff ects which we see.' 59 Only an 'extremely depraved' ratiocination can believe that Nature is an e ff ect of chance. 60 In Hooke's eyes, a rigorous physical explication of phenomena does not entail the refusal of the Christian doctrine. Natural philosophy is limited to natural causes, and miracles or suspensions of natural laws should not be part of it. It is signi fi cant that Hooke's lectures closed with a claim of the libertas philosophandi and the refusal  of  authority  contained  in  Royal  Society's  Horazian  motto Nullius iurare in verba magistri . 61\n\nHooke's conciliation of biblical history and pagan mythology by means of a physical hermeneutic produced a sort of 'physico-mythology'. Hooke did not use science to defend sacred history, rather the contrary. 62 Th e strict comparison between sacred history and pagan mythology and their subordinate role to natural history generated scepticism towards the historical value  of  the  bible. 63 Hooke's  ambiguity  evidently  appears  in  the  case  of\n\n- 57 Cf.

Hooke's circle\n\nHooke's ideas on sacred history were not limited to the lectures delivered at the Royal Society. His diaries attest the existence of a group of scholars interested in these topics. Th e place of their exchange of ideas was not the Society, but the co ff eehouses where Hooke met Francis Lodwick, Edmond Halley, John Aubrey, Richard Waller and others scholars interested in discussing the Genesis account of the formation of the world. 65 Diary entries from November 1675 to December 1676 attest that their private discussions were not limited to these topics. All the members of the so-called Hooke circle were fellows of the Royal Society. Th e choice of an alternative place to the public meetings of the Society suggests the need of a private place where fellows freely exchanged their ideas not only on natural history and the Bible, but even on the Society itself. Lodwick's desire to escape the censure of orthodoxy coexisted with Hooke's dissatisfaction with the Society's organization and his criticism of the fi rst secretary Henry Oldenburg. On 11 December 1675 the informal circle took the shape of a 'new clubb'. Secrecy was its main feature. 'We now began our new philosophical clubb - writes Hooke on 1 January 1676 - and resolvd upon ingaging ourselves not to speak of any thing that was then reveald sub sigillo to any one not to declare that we had such meeting at all'. On 14 October 1676 Hooke noted: 'resolved to leave the Royal Society'.\n\nBut the destiny of the new philosophical club depended on the success of Hooke's project of reform of the Society's o ffi ces. Involved in the election of the new president, Hooke himself was elected secretary a ft er Oldenburg's death in 1677. 66 Th e  polycentric  nature  of  the  early  Royal  Society  continued during Hooke's o ffi ce as much as the private meetings of Hooke circle.\n\n64   Claude  ALBRITTON, Th e  Abyss  of  Time:  Changing  Conceptions  of  the  Earth's  Antiquity a ft er the Sixteenth Century .

Th e need for secrecy and privacy that moved Hooke and his fellows towards a new philosophical club remained. Francis Lodwick was one of the leading members of the Hooke circle. He was involved in the formation of the new club and with Hooke shared interest in heterodox works, such as those of Richard Simon, Isaac La Peyrère and Baruch Spinoza. 68\n\nLodwick developed the most heterodox ideas within the Hooke circle, but  neither  expressed  them  at  the  Royal  Society  nor  published  them. 69 According  to  Lodwick,  the  Bible  described  things  'according  to  humane understanding  and  not  always  according  to  their  truth'.  Consequently, Lodwick undertook a physical interpretation of Genesis. Despite a recourse to Cartesian physics, Lodwick maintained belief in the direct intervention of God in the formation of the world. 70 Like Hooke, Lodwick did not question the existence of God or providence, but his arguments generated scepticism on the historical  validity  of  biblical  narration.  Lodwick's  most  heterodox ideas were about the origin of mankind. 'I suppose,' he writes, 'that the men primitiue were in number more then two a male and a female and that they were primitiuvely produced by the earth in places and climats di ff erent as it produceth other animals.' 71 His version of the Genesis narrative was very distant from Hooke's strictly physical account of world formation in Ovid and Moses. Members of the Hooke circle did not share the same ideas, but only a common heterodox approach to the sacred history.\n\n67 Felicity  HENDERSON,  'Unpublished  Material  from  the  Memorandum  Book  of  Robert Hooke, Guildhall Library Ms 1758.'

In the fi rst chapter of an unpublished manuscript, Th e Natural History of Weltshire , Aubrey defended the organic origin of fossils and the existence of great alterations of the Earth's structure and morphology a ft er the Creation. 72  On the contrary, Halley refused Hooke's ideas and advanced a di ff erent physical explication of the biblical deluge. Earth history, Halley notes, is 'knowable but by revelation, or else a posterior by induction from a convenient number of  experiments and observations.' 73 But  Holy Scriptures as historic documents are somewhere imperfect in the description of the natural events of the past. Th e secret working of Nature cannot be searched within the Bible, but should be inquired by means of experiments and observations, employing  only  natural  causes. 74 Halley  refused  Hooke's  hypothesis  of  an  axial displacement in the early time of the world. Adopting Newtonian physics, he thought that the deluge and morphology alterations were the e ff ects of the impact of a comet on the Earth. Th e Caspian depression is what remains of that catastrophe. 75 Th e biblical history of Creation contains an accurate description of the creation of man, not of the Earth or the universe. 76 Th us, biblical chronology was about the age of man, not of the world. For Halley, the saltines of oceans represented the 'medium' to calculate the age of the world, which is much beyond the six of seven thousand years of the Bible. 77 Like Hooke's and Lodwick's, Halley's research on the Earth's history was clearly independent of the authority of the Bible.\n\n72   POOLE, John Aubrey and the Advancement of Learning .

Within Solomon's House.\n\nHooke was aware that there were no direct natural proofs of the great geological alterations of the past. Th ere was a great di ff erence in magnitude between the observable earthquakes and those supposed by his hypothesis. 'We do not now fi nd - he notes - instances or e ff ects of the same grandure produced in our present age, or in the ages of which we have some perfect account.' 78 How  can  a theory  be  founded  on  such  grounds?  A seventeenth-century scientist had microscopes and telescopes for inaccessible objects because of their dimensions, but for those lost in the past no material instrument was available to him. 'By telescopes or microscopes - Hooke a ffi rms - he may not see some hundred of years backwards and forwards, and distinguish by such microscopes and telescopes events so far distant both before and behind himself in time, as if close by, and now present.' 79 Th e only data available were fossils, but in Hooke's view the simple historical collection of them did not advance human knowledge of the Earth's history. Observations and experiments related to fossils were collected 'in order to deduce some doctrine from them.' But how to obtain any 'certainty of knowledge' concerning the nature and origins of fossils or 'the cause and reason of the present fi gure, shape and constitution of the surface of this body of the earth?' To answer this question, in the lectures on the Earth's history Hooke recalled his ideas on the development of Bacon's methodology. 80 From 1665 to 1667 he probably composed a manuscript on scienti fi c method developing the plan of Micrographia 's preface. Hooke's methodological and scienti fi c project aimed to adapt Bacon's ideas to the new mechanical natural philosophy. According to Hooke, the new Baconian natural and experimental history is 'a philosophical history'. Experimental philosophy is not limited to the collection of data, but should provide the causes of phenomena. Experiments and observations were not collected at random, but followed attempts of explication. Hooke compared experiments to the letters of the alphabet, because most of them 'seldom signify but when they are joyn'd and compounded in syllables or words.' Th e experimental research should be guided by theory. Because of this, 'hints of accidental remarks' and 'queries' are part of the philosophi-\n\n78   HOOKE, Th e Posthumous , p. 427.\n\n80 Ibid. ,  p. 332,  334; cf. David  OLDROYD,  'Robert  Hooke's  Methodology  of  Science  as Exempli fi ed in his Discourse of Earthquakes.'

Th e distance separating researchers from the past of Nature, can be fi lled only by means of these methodological instruments. Guided by the organic hypothesis, Hooke employed the analogy between actual and past earthquakes. He compared the e ff ects now observable with fossils, then deduced the possible existence of greater earthquakes in the past causing the alterations of the Earth's surface and structure.\n\nIn 1668 he started his lectures declaring his point of view. Again, the defence of the use of hypotheses coexisted with their compatibility with the Society's methodology. Even if Society 'have hitherto seem'd to avoid and prohibit pre-conceived theories and deductions', their use in science is fundamental. It distinguished the vulgar empiricism from the real experimental philosophy. Only 'some pre-design'd module and theory and some purpose in our experiments' can guarantee a 'method in the collecting of material'. Without this method, experimental philosophy might have easily turned into a blind collections of meaningless data and random experiments. 84 Th e Society's aim was to collect and make experiments tending to the 'advancement\n\nA ft er  the  Society's  criticism  of Micrographia ,  in  the  lectures  of  1668 Hooke seems determined to defend from the beginning the methodological bases of his work. As we have seen, in 1664 Hooke was asked to add a dedicatory epistle to Micrographia to explain that the 'rules' of the Society avoid 'dogmatizing and the espousal of any hypothesis not su ffi ciently grounded and con fi rm'd by experiments'. Th e hypothesis presented in the book belonged to Hooke and could not be considered part of the Society's activities. But Hooke clearly declared that Society's rules did not condemn all hypotheses.  'I desire  -  he  states  -  to  have  them  understood  only  as  conjectures and  quæries  (which  your  method  does  not  altogether  disallow).' 82 Th ey were not intended as undisputable axioms, but only as 'doubtful problems and uncertain ghesses' guiding the course of the inquiry. 83 Th is note shows the  existence  of  di ff erent  interpretation  of  the  Society's  methodological program. Notwithstanding the council's in fl uence, Hooke did not renounce to consider his methodological principle as part of the common Baconian inheritance assumed by the Society.\n\n81   HOOKE, Th e Posthumous , pp. 18, 42.\n\n83 Ibid. , p. V.\n\n- 82  HOOKE, Micrographia , n.p.\n\n84  HOOKE, Th e Posthumous , p. 280.\n\nof natural knowledge', to build 'a fi rm and lasting structure of philosophy'. In Hooke's eyes both Micrographia and the lectures on fossils are 'specimen of such a structure raised from observations and collections of their own,' 85 and his work was not in contrast with the Society's methodological rules.\n\nA more complex image of the Society emerges in the discussions of the fossils question. Not only did the fellows not share a unique methodological program, they even maintained contrasting views o Nature. 88 Despite the prevailing  assumption  of  a corpuscular  or  atomic  views  of  matter,  mechanical philosophy was not the only conception of Nature di ff used among the  fellows.  Furthermore,  mechanistically  oriented  fellows  did  not  share a monolithic view of matter and motion. 89 In 1665 the divine Joseph Glanvill claimed that the Royal Society's 'experimental way of enquiry' was associated with 'the mechanical attempts for solving the phenomena' undertaken by some fellows embracing 'the Cartesian and atomical hypothesis'. 90 But the mechanical philosophy was not the only view of nature associated with\n\nBut was there an o ffi cial methodology or a set of principles adopted by all the fellows of the early Royal Society? It seems unlikely. As with Hooke, other  fellows  too  interpreted  the  Society's  role  in  very  di ff erent  ways,  according to their interests and leanings. Sprat's work contains only one of the di ff erent  interpretations  of  the  Society's  Baconian  program. 86 Apart  from the di ff erences among fellows' works, the lack of such an o ffi cial doctrine is suggested by the frequency and diversity of reform plans in the early decades a ft er the foundation. Every plan, in fact, is based on a di ff erent style of Baconianism and a consequent methodological orientation. 87\n\n85 Ibid. , p. 329.\n\n- 87 Michael  HUNTER  -  Paul  WOOD,  'Towards  Solomon's  House:  Rival  Strategies  for Reforming the Early Royal Society of London.'

As Seth Ward and John Wilkins observed in 1654, 'the magneticall philosophy' was well received by the founders of the Society. 91 In fl uenced by Gilbert vitalistic view of the earth, Martin Lister refused the organic origin of fossils and Hooke's mechanical philosophy. 92 At the meeting of the 2 November 1671 the Secretary of the Society, Henry Oldenburg, read Lister's letter containing the refusal of the organic hypothesis. It  is  signi fi cant that Lister's observations on fossils were originated by the English translation of Steno's Prodromus ,  published early in 1671. Indeed, Lister's  main  argument  consisted  in  the  lack  of  correspondence  between fossils and living being. Th is was a problem Italians scientists did not know, because the fossils analysed by Steno belong to the Holocene and the Quaternary period, being similar in form to living species. As Martin Rudwick observed,  the  organic  origin  of  the  Mediterranean  fossils  'was  therefore fairly simple to assert.' 93 Nevertheless, there were members of the Society, such as Hooke and John Ray, who defended the organic origins of fossils even though this entailed a new problem about the lack of correspondence with living beings. Hooke, in fact, was the only one to criticise Lister's arguments at  the  meeting of the Society on 2 November 1671. 94 Lister  acknowledged the di ff erence between Mediterranean and English fossils, and emphasized the importance of an analytical approach to fossils, which overcomes the analogies and resemblances sustaining the organic hypothesis:\n\nTh is  argument perhaps will not so readily take place with those persons that think it nor worth the while exactly and minutely to distinguish the several species of the things of nature, but are content to acquiesce in fi gure, resemblances, kind and such general notions.\n\nLister's con fi dence in the relevance of this taxonomic argument clearly comes across at the end of the letter. O ff ering some specimens to the Society, he seemed to have challenged Hooke to solve the taxonomic problems involved in the organic hypothesis: 'if there shall not be enough speci fi cally\n\n91  John WILKINS - Seth WARD, Vindiciae academiarum .

As  Lister  himself  noted  in the previous lines, it was not only a di ff erence of approach, taxonomical or historical, but 'a di ff erent view of nature' separating his ideas from those of  Hooke  and  Steno. 95 According  to  Lister,  what  we  now  consider  fossils were only mineral substances produced, like all other minerals, by seminal active principles. His refusal of the mechanic world-view appears even in the  1680s  polemics  with  Hooke  on  fossils  and  magnetism.  In  both  cases, Lister defended a vitalistic image of Nature, incompatible with the mechanical one maintained by Hooke. In Lister's view, the fossils question was not a mechanical problem, because those particular stones were produced by an active non-mechanical principle conferring them shapes resembling those of living beings. 96\n\nJohn Ray and Robert Plot also took part to the Society's discussions on fossils originated by Lister's letter of 1671. Ray published his papers only in 1693, while Plot discussed the question in his Natural History of Oxfordshire of  1676.  Ray  defended  the  organic  origins  of  fossils,  but  he  did  not  share Hooke's ideas on sacred history and the chain of being. On the contrary, the organic hypothesis in his eyes was the only way to save the image of a cosmos well governed by providence. Th e argument of a plastic virtue mimicking living being can support the idea that things are produced by chance and without any reason in nature. If we refuse the organic hypothesis, Ray a ffi rmed, 'we put a weapon into the Atheist's hands, a ff ording him a strong argument to prove that even animals themselves are casual productions, and not  the  e ff ects  of  counsel  or  design.' 97 Ray's  aim  was  to  achieve  conciliation between the organic hypothesis and the defence of sacred history and providence. Fossils were the remains of the universal biblical deluge, whose origins and nature were di ff erent from the local inundations described by pagan writers. It was the divine intervention that caused the Deluge, and it  was  the  Deluge  that  changed the morphology of the earth, altering the order of land and sea. 98 For Ray, a strictly physical description of the Earth's history was not possible, because 'God doth not stand by as an idle and un-\n\n95 Martin LISTER, 'A Letter  of  Mr.  Lister,  written  at  York  August  25,  1671.'

As a taxonomist, he knew that the enlargement of the European world originated in the continuous discovery of new species. Th e limits of human knowledge of nature should not be imposed on God's providence: species are not destroyed or lost, but continue to live as they were originally created 'somewhere or other in the seas'. 100\n\nRay maintained a taxonomic approach to the question of fossils, depriving  it  of  all  the  perilous  consequences  which  Hooke's  historical  ideas  involved, such as biological transformism. Even Robert Plot, the fi rst keeper of the Ashmolean museum and secretary of the Oxford Philosophical Society, refused Hooke's transformist ideas on species. For Plot, fossils were lapides sui genersis , produced by the action of a saline active principle upon the matter of earth. 101 Th e universal deluge was not su ffi cient reason for the irregular disposition of fossils, and earthquakes were not able to transform all earth's morphology. Plot's main argument against the organic hypothesis consisted in the refusal of species extinction:\n\nIf it be said that possibly these species may be now lost, I shall leave it to reader to judge, whether it be likely that providence which took so much care to secure the works of creation in Noah's fl ood, should either then, or since, have been so unmindful of some shellfi sh (and no other animals) as to su ff er any one to be lost. 102\n\nOther  members  of  the  Oxford  Society  expressed  similar  ideas  against Hooke's hypothesis. In 1687 a letter of Edmund Halley to John Wallis described Hooke's lectures on the Earth's history. Hooke's ideas were discussed and criticised by the members of the Oxford Society in a series of letters sent to London in the following months. 103 As Wallis wrote on 4 March, Oxford fellows  'seemed not forward to turn the world upside down (for so 'twas phrased) to save an hypothesis, without cogent reason for it; not only, that possibly it might be so, but that had to been so.' For them, the great altera-\n\n- 99 Ibid. , p. 208.\n- 101 Robert PLOT, Th e Natural History of Oxfordshire . Oxford: 1676, pp. 32-35, 105, 122.\n- 100 Ibid. , p.

Conclusion\n\nAccording  to  the  traditional  image  of  the  Royal  Society,  its  aim  was  the institutionalization  of  a clear  program  of  research  founded  on  Baconian history  of  Nature. Th is  view,  whose  origins  are  in  Sprat's History ,  is  still maintained  by  historians  with  di ff erent  or  opposite  interests.  Positivists historians saw in the Society the realization of Baconian reform of natural science and a model of the modern scienti fi c institutions of the nineteenth and  the  twentieth  century. Th e  unity  and  uniformity  characterizing  this image  are  maintained  on  di ff erent  grounds  by  non-positivist  historians. According to Henry Van Leeuwen, for instance, the Royal Society had not only an institutional and methodological programme, but also a particular theory of knowledge commonly accepted by all fellows and identi fi able with John  Tillotson's  religious  scepticism. Th rough  Glanvill  and  Wilkins,  this theory was assumed by Robert Boyle and conditioned Isaac Newton's position on gravity. 105 Steven Shapin and Simon Scha ff er,  mainly interested to evidence the social nature of the knowledge question in restoration science, identi fi ed Society's institutional aim with the a ffi rmation of a new 'form of life', that of the experimental scientist able to distinguish legitimate matters of  facts  from  illegitimate  causal  explanation. 106 Th us,  di ff erent  historical analyses seemingly share the assumption that the Baconian experimental philosophy consisted of anti-hypothetical empiricism, which was embraced by the Royal Society. 107 Th e debates on fossils and Earth history suggest an alternative image of the Society and its fellows.

In addition, what we may call the  philosophical  independence  of  the  fellows,  hindered  the  existence  of a common programme of research in the Earth sciences.\n\nTh e variety of positions on methodology suggests that Bacon and Baconianism worked as a sort of label used for very di ff erent objects. 108 Regarding ontology,  the  apparent  unity  guaranteed  by  the  unifying  slogan  of  Baconianism, was not available. Among fellows, along with di ff erent or rather opposite versions of mechanical philosophy, a series of anti-mechanical philosophies of Nature were di ff used. 109 Lister and Hooke, Halle and Plot, Ray and Lodwick, did not follow any institutional program of research, nor did they embrace a cooperative compilation of the general history of nature. As Marie Boas Hall a ffi rmed, 'the Society acquired its reputation not because it was a research institute directed by a brilliant autocrat, but because it was an association of independent equals', who willingly shared the discoveries and ideas which they achieved independently in the solitude of their own studies. 110\n\n108 Marie BOAS HALL, 'Science in the Early Royal Society.'
