In this paper, I analyse one such  attempt  to  establish  the  most  reliable knowledge  of  nature:  the  so-called  Mosaic physics proposed by the Reformed encyclopaedist Johann Heinrich Alsted. Although in his  early  works  on  Physica  Mosaica  Alsted declares  that  his  primary  aim  is  proving the  harmony  that  exists  between  various traditions  of  natural  philosophy,  namely between  the  Mosaic  and  the  Peripatetic approaches,  and  despite  the  fact  that  his biblical encyclopaedia of 1625 was intended to be based on a literal reading of the Bible, he  never  truly  abandoned  the  Aristotelian framework of physics. What is more, in his mature encyclopaedia of 1630, he eventually openly preferred Aristotle to other naturalphilosophical traditions. I argue, therefore, that  Alsted's  bold  vision  of  Mosaic  physics remained unfulfi  lled and should be assessed as an unsuccessful project of early modern natural philosophy.\n\nKeywords: Johann Heinrich Alsted; Mosaic physics; natural philosophy; early modern science; Aristotelianism\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAbstrakt: Někteří  raně  novověcí  učenci byli přesvědčeni, že Písmo poskytuje jistější poznání  nežli  všechny  světské  autority  s  Aristotelem včele - či zkoumání samotné přírody.  Ve  své  studii  se  zabývám  jednou z takových snah o získání toho nejspolehlivějšího vědění o přírodě: takzvanou mosaickou fyzikou, jak ji koncipoval reformovaný encyklopedista Johann Heinrich Alsted. Ačkoliv ve svých raných dílech, jež se Physica Mosaica  týkají,  Alsted  za  svůj  nejvyšší  cíl prohlašuje dokázání souladu mezi různými podobami přírodní fi  losofi  e, především mezi mosaickým  a peripatetickým přístupem, a navzdory tomu, že jeho biblická encyklopedie z roku 1625 měla být založena na doslovném  čtení  Bible,  Alsted  ve  skutečnosti nikdy neopustil aristotelská východiska přírodní  fi  losofi  e.  Co  je  ještě  pozoruhodnější, Alstedova vrcholná encyklopedie z roku 1630 již přímo upřednostňuje aristotelismus před jinými přírodně-fi  losofi  ckými přístupy.

Introduction\n\nIn her pioneering study 'Mosaic Physics and the Search for a Pious Natural Philosophy in the Late Renaissance,' Ann Blair pointed out that the 16 th and 17 th centuries can be described as a time of persistent attempts to undermine Aristotelianism and replace it with alternative philosophies, namely Platonism and its Neo-Platonic varieties, Epicureanism, Stoicism, experimental natural philosophy (as in the case of Robert Boyle), or with the most pious philosophy that would be based on a literal reading of the Bible, i.e., Mosaic philosophy in the strict sense. 1  Th e authors who can be included in the last category,  Blair  specifi  es,  were  mostly  Reformed  philosophers  seeking  primarily to off  er a new system of natural philosophy based on a philosophical commentary on the Bible or to draw new principles of physics immediately from the Holy Scripture. 2\n\nAlthough previous research had reached diff  erent conclusions, Sachiko Kusukawa and David S. Sytsma recently showed that it was indeed Jean Calvin (1509-1564) who guided the Reformed natural philosophers to a literal reading of Bible, i.e., to understanding Moses's narrative of the Creation as an accurate source of knowledge. 3 Sytsma, moreover, argues that Calvin by no means condemned physics, or natural philosophy: on the contrary, in his\n\nTh   is paper is published as an output of a research funded by the Faculty of Arts, University of Ostrava, project SGS03/FF/2019-2020 'Bílá místa dějin a současnosti fi  lozofi  e: Osobnosti a témata na okraji kánonu.' Th e author is grateful to the two anonymous reviewers for their comments, corrections, and suggestions.\n\n- 1 Ann  Blair,  'Mosaic  Physics  and  the  Search  for  a  Pious  Natural  Philosophy  in  the  Late Renaissance,' Isis 91, no. 1 (2000): 32-37.\n- 2 Ibid.,  48-50.  Similarly,  see  Jaromír  Červenka, Die  Naturphilosophie  des  Johann  Amos Comenius (Praha:  ČSAV,  1970),  111-13.  Both  Blair  and  Červenka,  however,  argue  that biblical  literalists  can  be  found  also  among  Catholics,  e.g.,  Benedictus  Pereira.  See  Blair, 'Mosaic  Physics,'  50-51;  Červenka, Die  Naturphilosophie ,  109  (on  pages  28-30,  Červenka also discusses Melanchton's positive attitude to Mosaic physics). On the Patristic, scholastic, and Kabbalistic authors involved in this area of interest, see ibid., 105-10, and Bernd Roling, Physica  sacra:  Wunder,  Naturwissenschaft    und  historischer  Schrift  sinn  zwischen  Mittelalter und Früher Neuzeit (Leiden: Brill, 2013).\n- 3    Sachiko  Kusukawa, Th   e Transformation  of Natural  Philosophy: Th   e Case  of Philip Melanchthon (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), 205-6; David Sytsma, 'Calvin, Daneau,  and  Physica  Mosaica:  Neglected  Continuities  at  the  Origins  of  an  Early  Modern Tradition,' Church History and Religious Culture 95, no. 4 (2015): 457-76. Cf. also Červenka, Die Naturphilosophie , 110.\n\nInstitutio , he theologically justifi  ed the study of nature as a way to a proper understanding of the secrets of divine wisdom. 4\n\nTh   is direct connection to Calvin can also be found in the work of Johann Heinrich Alsted (1588-1638), Reformed philosopher and theologian from Herborn, since he explicitly refers to Calvin's commentary on the Book of  Genesis.  Alsted  agrees  with  Calvin  that  although  Moses  presented  the physical topics in everyday language ( populariter ), he must be regarded as a reliable source of natural-philosophical knowledge. 5  Th e aim of this study\n\n4 Sytsma, 'Calvin, Daneau, and Physica Mosaica,' 463-64.\n\n5 Johann Heinrich Alsted, Systema physicae harmonicae, quatuor libellis methodicè propositum, in quorum I.

Most probably, Alsted refers to Jean Calvin, Comm. Gen. 1:16 and 2:10: 'Here lies the diff  erence; Moses wrote in a popular style things which without instruction, all ordinary persons, endued with  common  sense,  are  able  to  understand;  but  astronomers  investigate  with  great  labor whatever the sagacity of the human mind can comprehend. Nevertheless, this study is not to be reprobated, nor this science to be condemned, because some frantic persons are wont boldly to reject whatever is unknown to them. For astronomy is not only pleasant, but also very useful to be known: it cannot be denied that this art unfolds the admirable wisdom of God. Wherefore, as ingenious men are to be honored who have expended useful labor on this subject, so they who have leisure and capacity ought not to neglect this kind of exercise. Nor did Moses truly wish to withdraw us from this pursuit in omitting such things as are peculiar to the art; but because he was ordained a teacher as well of the unlearned and rude as of the learned, he could not otherwise fulfi  l his offi ce than by descending to this grosser method of instruction'; 'Moses does not speak acutely, nor in a philosophical manner, but popularly, so that every one least informed may understand him.' Th e  English translations are based on John Calvin, 'Commentary on Genesis,' in Christian Classics Ethereal Library ,  accessed January  15,  2019, http://www.ccel.org.  For  Protestant  biblical  literalism  and  the  widely accepted  principle  of  accommodation,  i.e.,  'the  position  which  held  on  the  one  hand  that scripture did not contain anything which contradicted known scientifi  c truths, but conceded on the other that the science which was to be found in scripture was 'accommodated' to the mental capacities of its initial audience,' see Peter Harrison, Th   e Bible, Protestantism, and the Rise of Natural Science (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001), 121-38 or Stephen D. Snobelen, ''In the Language of Men': Th e Hermeneutics of Accommodation in the Scientifi  c Revolution,' in Nature and Scripture in the Abrahamic Religions: Up to 1700 , eds. Jitse M. van der Meer and Scott Mandelbrote (Leiden: Brill, 2008), 691-732. In Alsted's case, as we will see,  accommodation does not by any means exclude the literal reading of Genesis 1 as an accurate narrative of cosmogony and natural history (as Sytsma already showed for Calvin and Lambert Daneau, cf. Sytsma, 'Calvin, Daneau, and Physica Mosaica,' 473-75). For a general introduction to Alsted's philosophical and theological work, see Gerhard Menk, Die Hohe\n\nis  thus  to  analyse the development of Alsted's philosophical views on nature and to contribute towards an understanding of early modern Mosaic physics,  which  as  yet  is  an  underexplored  part  of  the  history  of  science. 6 We will see that Alsted's bold project of the new, most reliable natural philosophy derived from Scripture turned out to be unviable, leading back to Aristotelianism, if not a complete cul-de-sac of this branch of early modern philosophia naturalis . I believe, however, that it is equally important to deal with  successful  and  unsuccessful  lines  of  development  of  the  history  of science  (if  one  may  use  these  simplifying  and  quite  anachronistic  labels). Only such an approach would enable us to see the emergence of modern science  as  a  complex,  labyrinthine,  and  painful  process  marked  by  many (now nearly forgotten) failures - in contrast to its idealized and simplifi  ed popular image. 7\n\n## 2. Alsted's Early Texts on Natural Philosophy: Systema physicae harmonicae (1612) and Physica harmonica (1616)\n\nAlsted devoted already some of his earliest writings to natural philosophy. His very fi  rst text on this topic was published already in 1610; the Compendium physicae was, however, to a considerable extent based on excerpts from Julius Caesar Scaliger's Exotericarum exercitationum libri XV de subtilitate . 8 Th   erefore,  for  studying  Alsted's  authentic  views  on  nature,  the  second, greatly expanded version of his treatise which was published in 1612 in Her-\n\nSchule Herborn in ihrer Frühzeit (1584-1660). Ein Beitrag zum Hochschulwesen des deutschen Kalvinismus  im  Zeitalter  der  Gegenreformation (Wiesbaden:  Selbstverlag  der  Historischen Kommission  für  Nassau,  1981);  Michel, Der  Herborner  Philosoph  Johann  Heinrich  Alsted ; Howard Hotson, Johann Heinrich Alsted, 1588 -1638: Between Renaissance, Reformation and Universal Reform (Oxford: Clarendon, 2000) where on pages 7-14 the author discusses the secondary sources related to Alsted and his thought.\n\n6 Cf., e.g., the most recent monograph focusing on the scientifi  c revolution where only a few remarks - at best - can be found: David Wooton, Th   e Invention of Science: A New History of the Scientifi  c Revolution (London: Pinguin Books, 2016).\n\n7 Cf. David Wooton, Bad Medicine: Doctors Doing Harm since Hippocrates (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007), 14-15: 'We know how to write histories of discovery and progress, but not how to write histories of stasis, of delay, of digression. We know how to write about the delight of discovery, but not about attachment to the old and resistance to the new.'\n\n8 In fact, this text represents a disputation of Johann Bilenfeld from Bremen presided by Alsted. Cf.  Johann  Heinrich  Alsted  (praes.)  -  Johann  Bilenfeld  (resp.), Compendium  physicae;  in quinque partes tributum; congestum maximam partem è Julii Caesaris Scaligeri Exotericarum exercitationum libri 15 de subtilitate; methodicè digestum (Herbornae: [Christoph Corvinus], 1610), esp. 3-4 (besides Scaliger, other sources are listed as well, namely B. Keckermann).\n\nborn under the title Systema physicae harmonicae is of much greater value. Th   e third, further amended and extended version was issued in 1616 in the same place and entitled Physica harmonica . 9\n\nMosaic physics, or Physica Mosaica , which is absent in the fi  rst edition, constitutes  one  of  the  four  parts  of  the  second  and  third  editions  of  the treatise; the other parts are dedicated to Rabbinic and Kabbalistic natural philosophy ( Physica Hebraeorum, Rabbinica et Cabbalistica ), the Aristotelian, or Peripatetic, tradition ( Physica Peripatetica ), and the alchemical conception of natural philosophy ( Physica Chemica ). Alsted repeatedly declares that the primary purpose of his works is to harmonize (put in harmonia ; conciliatio )  these  four  main  traditions  of  natural  philosophy  which  have existed since the early beginnings of this discipline. 10\n\nFor the present purposes, the most important sections of both Systema physicae harmonicae and Physica harmonica are their very fi  rst parts, dealing with physica , or physiologia , or philosophia naturalis Mosaica , or Christiana , or sacra . 11 As Alsted argues, this conception of natural philosophy is directly derived from its author, or divine mediator, Moses; namely, from the fi  rst chapter of the Book of Genesis. 12 From Alsted's statements, it is evident that in his early writings he regarded Mosaic physics as the oldest and also the most reliable branch of natural philosophy ever: 'Th is will be for us the Lydian stone, the Cynosure, and fi  nally the key to natural science.' 13\n\nMosaic physics can, most generally, be divided into cosmogony ( cosmopoeiâ ) and natural history ( historia naturalis ). 14 In the cosmogonic passages, Alsted discusses the fundamental principles of all natural bodies ( principia rerum naturalium ): God, who is the external principle of creation ( principium creationis externum ) and the ultimate causa effi ciens and fi  nis ; nature, which is the internal principle common to all bodies (the God-imprinted\n\n- 9 Johann  Heinrich  Alsted, Physica  harmonica , quatuor  libellis  methodice  proponens,  I.

As David S. Sytsma has shown, this general-particular distinction of natural philosophy can be traced back to the very fi  rst early modern Mosaic philosopher, Lambert Daneau and his work Physica christiana, sive de rerum creatarum cognitione et usu disputatio e sacrae scripturae fontibus hausta (Lyon: Pierre de Saint-André, 1576). See Sytsma, 'Calvin, Daneau, and Physica Mosaica,' 466, 475.\n\ncapability to propagate and germinate); and particular internal principles which are either constitutive ( materia prima and forma )  or  transmutative ( privatio ). 15\n\nTh   e further text explicitly connects primaeval matter, or materia prima , with the fi  rst verse of Genesis 1. In the beginning of creation, Alsted holds, matter constituted a basis of both the heavens and the earth ( materia coeli et  terrae );  in  fact,  it  was  not  uniform  but  of duplex nature,  heavenly  and earthly ( coelestis  et  terrestris ).  Form,  in  correspondence  with  Genesis  1:2, was bestowed on matter by the Holy Spirit in order to give existence to simple bodies ( corpus simplex ), i.e., the elements. 16\n\nTh   e universe is divided into the heavens ( coelum ) and the earthly region which consists either of the four elements ( elementa ;  i.e., ignis , aër , aqua , terra ),  or  of  complex bodies based on the elements (i.e., the elementata ). 17 Th   e elements were created subsequently, fi  rst of all, during the fi  rst day of creation, fi  re as the vehicle of light; then air and water which were established during the second day (cf. Genesis 1:6-8). 18 Th e earth was, fi  nally, created by  separation  from  water  during  the  third  day  of  creation. 19 It  should  be noted that throughout the text, Alsted distinguishes between aqua and terra informis on the one hand, and aqua and terra formata .  While the former corresponds to the duplex nature of primaeval matter ( materia terrestris was a basis of both water and earth - i.e., of the two parts of the world created during the fi  rst day of creation; materia coelestis represented, on the other hand, the basis of light), the latter denotes the actual elements of water and earth created during the second and third day of creation. In the strict sense, therefore, in the beginning there were just three main constituents that gave rise to the elements themselves, namely aqua , terra , and lux informis . 20\n\nConcerning complex bodies,  or elementata ,  Alsted  lists  minerals  (although Moses himself omits to explicitly mention them, as Alsted points out),  plants  (cf.  Genesis  1:11),  and  celestial  lights  ( luminaria  coelestia ;  cf. Genesis 1:14). 21 In the Mosaic part of Systema physicae harmonicae of 1612,\n\n- 15 Alsted, Systema physicae harmonicae , 14-17.\n- 16 Ibid., 14-24, 29-36.\n- 17 Ibid., 38, 40.\n- 18 Ibid., 32-34, 37-40.\n- 19 Ibid., 40-42.\n- 20 Ibid., 51; Alsted, Physica harmonica , 38-39.\n\n21 Alsted also discusses how the distinction between light and darkness was possible since the very fi  rst day of creation, although God created the celestial lights (and specifi  cally the Sun) as late as the fourth day. He simply holds that God made one hemisphere of the Earth dark and\n\nAlsted repeatedly maintains that the Sun, the Moon and all the stars consist of fi  re ('Elemental fi  re is in celestial lights'; 'It is evident that elemental fi  re is both outside those lights and in them'). 22 In some other passages of the same part of the treatise he, however, converges on an Aristotelian-like cosmology when he explicitly speaks about aether. 23 Yet from his discussion of the second day of creation, for instance, it seems that he describes aether and its properties in the same way as he describes the element of fi  re in other (and prevalent) paragraphs. In other words: Alsted enumerates four elements and simply replaces fi  re with aether. Moreover, postulating aether does not in any way match the preceding cosmogonic and cosmologic exposition of his conception of Mosaic physics. It is possible that Alsted was aware of this diffi   culty: for in his Physica harmonica of 1616 he simply leaves out the passages concerning the nature of celestial lights and only very briefl  y states that they have a beginning and matter ( initium et materiam ). 24\n\nBesides  that,  in  the  parts  of  both Systema  physicae  harmonicae and Physica harmonica dedicated to Peripatetic physics, Alsted emphasizes that the element of fi  re receives its heat ( caliditas )  from the Sun and the stars, although they themselves do not burn ('Th e Sun is not a subject of heat but a subordinate instrument of God's providence to deliver elemental heat to all things'), i.e., are not made up of fi  re. Most importantly, Alsted stresses that fi   re is found only in the sublunar sphere and that all the meteora including comets appear only below the Moon. 25 It seems, therefore, that with respect to Aristotelian physics Alsted was quite unwavering, while in relation to the Mosaic account of natural philosophy he was not entirely able to harmonize the narrative of Genesis with the common (Aristotelian-Ptolemaic) cosmological views. His rather inorganic libation to Aristotle could, therefore, be the main reason why in his early texts on Mosaic natural philosophy Alsted oscillated  between  fi  re  and  aether.  (Note  that  in  the  Mosaic  parts  of  his the other light, for the main vehicle of light was the element of fi  re, created as soon as during the fi  rst day. See Alsted, Systema physicae harmonicae , 35-36.\n\n- 22 Alsted, Systema  physicae  harmonicae ,  32,  43-45:  'Ignis  elementaris  est  in  luminaribus coelestibus'; 'Patet itaque, ignem elementarem esse extra luminaria ista, &amp; in iis.'\n- 23 Ibid., 40. Similarly, cf. the fourth part (i.e., Physica Chemica ) of both the second and third edition:  Alsted, Systema  physicae  harmonicae ,  191;  Alsted, Physica  harmonica ,  235  where Alsted speaks about quinta essentia .\n- 24 Alsted, Physica harmonica , 34.\n- 25 Alsted, Systema physicae harmonicae , 128-29; Alsted, Physica harmonica , 116-18, 142: 'Sol non  est  subjectum  caloris,  sed  instrumentum  subordinatum  providentiae  Dei  ad  calorem elementarem omnibus rebus adferendum,' or similarly 'Calor non est in sideribus, sed in hisce nostris, et ab illis.'\n\nearly treatises Alsted mentions aether always only in two places and does not explicitly make use of the distinction between the sublunary and the superlunary spheres.)\n\nRegarding other complex bodies, in the following text Alsted deals with creatures  endowed  with  souls  that  either  lack  reason  (created  during  the fi   ft   h and the sixth days) or those that are gift  ed with it, i.e., humans. Th ese passages focusing on natural history are also based on the fi  rst chapter of Genesis. 26\n\nTh   e Aristotelian leitmotif of Alstedian Mosaic physics can also be observed in other aspects of his conception. Although he refers explicitly only to Patristic authorities (e.g., Basil of Ceasarea, Gregory of Nyssa, Augustine, John of Damascus) 27 or recent Mosaic philosophers (Lambert Daneau, Franciscus Junius, Johannes Piscator), 28 his Mosaic exposition is heavily indebted to  Aristotle,  fi  rst  and  foremost  from  the  point  of  view  of  terminology.  In an obviously Peripatetic manner, Alsted uses notions such as matter, form, and privation; the division of the four causes of any being; the distinction between two heavy and two light elements, etc. 29\n\nStill, it must be said that Alsted's endeavour to highlight the importance of the Mosaic narrative can also be documented in other parts of his early natural-philosophical treatises. In the section named Physica Hebraeorum, Rabbinica  et  Cabbalistica (especially  in  the  last,  Kabbalistic  part),  Alsted puts a strong emphasis on the fi  rst chapter of Genesis and its meaning for the  proper  interpretation  of  the  Fift  y  Gates  of  Understanding  ( portae  intelligentiae )  that  descend from the fi  rst and supreme, i.e., God, to the last created, i.e., man. 30\n\nTh   e treatise on Physica Peripatetica is, besides the writings of Aristotle himself, based mainly on Julius Caesar Scaliger's Exotericarum exercitationum libri XV de subtilitate , Jacopo Zabarella's In libros Aristotelis Physicorum commentarii , Clemens Timpler's Physicae seu Philosophiae naturalis systema methodicum ,  and other  predominantly  Peripatetic  sources  (e.g.,  Albertus\n\n26 Alsted, Systema physicae harmonicae , 42-49.\n\n27 Among the early modern Mosaic philosophers, it was a common practice to rely also on Patristic hexaemeral literature.

Th e terminology used in this part is analogical to that used in characteristics of Physica Mosaica : God is understood as a universal principle  of  the  universe  ( principium  universale );  nature  as  the  common principle ( principium commune );  matter and form as internal constitutive principles  ( principia  constitutiva ),  privation  as  a  transmutative  principle ( principium transmutativum ). 32 Similarly, in the Mosaic and the Peripatetic sections of Systema physicae harmonicae as well as of Physica harmonica the same conception of the universe can be identifi  ed, the basis of which lies in simple bodies ( corpus simplex )  -  either  the  superior, simplest, perfect and immutable heaven ( coelum ) or the inferior, i.e., the four elements (fi  re, air, water, and earth). 33\n\nIn the Peripatetic parts of his early writings, Alsted explicitly refers to the  Mosaic  account  even  in  order  to  support  the  Aristotelian  conception of  nature.  Th e  Mosaic  arguments  are  used,  for  instance,  for  proving  the existence of internal time ( tempus internum ). Alsted rhetorically asks: If this kind of time did not exist, how would it be possible to speak about time during the fi  rst three days of Creation, i.e., before the celestial lights (namely the Sun) were established? 34 Moreover, Moses's narration gives a clue to the correct understanding of time and its beginning as such:  'Let us say with Augustine: God created the world not in time but together with time.' 35  Th e Bible is used as an indisputable source of natural-philosophical knowledge in general: Alsted argues that vine ( vitis ) existed before the fl  ood; otherwise the  proposition  that  God  ceased  to  create  new  species  cannot  be  true. 36\n\n31 Alsted, Systema  physicae  harmonicae ,  67,  72-73,  79.  For  the  Aristotelian  background  of Zabarella's and Timpler's work, see Howard Hotson, Commonplace Learning: Ramism and its German Ramifi  cations 1543-1630 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007), 227-30.\n\n32 Alsted, Systema physicae harmonicae , 72-74, 95.\n\n33 Ibid., 119-127.\n\n- 34 Ibid., 108. Cf. also ibid., p. 25. Th is Mosaic account can be found - as one of only a few cases - already in Alsted - Bilenfeld, Compendium physicae , 43-46.\n- 35 Alsted, Systema  physicae  harmonicae ,  111:  'Dicamus  cum  Augustino,  Deum  creasse mundum non in tempore, sed cum tempore.' Alsted possibly refers to Augustine, De civitate Dei , XI, 6.\n- 36 Alsted, Physica harmonica ,  180.  Similarly,  in Physica of  1630, Alsted holds that God did not create 'herbas venenatas, animalia foeda et noxia' aft  er the fall but already during the very fi  rst act of creation. Cf. Johann Heinrich Alsted, Encyclopaedia Septem tomis distincta, I. Praecognita disciplinarum, libris quatuor. II. Philologia, libris sex. III. Philosophia theoretica,\n\nSimilarly, questions related to primaeval matter (or chaos ) can be solved by seeking information in the Bible. For instance, Alsted resolves, by a literal reading of Genesis, the question whether the primaeval matter was created in loco . 37 To sum up, the creation of the world, i.e., the opera sex dierum must be studied in order to properly understand God, the exclusive causa effi ciens of the whole universe. 38\n\nFrom  the  point  of  view  of  the  diff  erences  between Systema  physicae harmonicae of  1612  and Physica  harmonica of  1616,  it  is  evident  that  the Peripatetic part was the only one to be substantially extended. Alsted added new paragraphs dealing with properties of mixed bodies and amended the treatises on particular categories of bodies, i.e., the specifi  c levels of being -vapores , fumi , meteora , lapides , metalla (and other fossilia ), vegetabilia (or plantae ), animalia , and homo . 39  Th e second and fourth parts of the writings (i.e., Physica Hebraeorum, Rabbinica et Cabbalistica and Physica Chemica ) were, on the other hand, only slightly changed between 1612 and 1616. Th is could testify to Alsted's rather secondary interest in these branches of natural philosophy. 40\n\nHow has the exposition of Mosaic physics changed between 1612 and 1616? In Physica harmonica , Alsted stresses even more that the Mosaic narrative should be regarded as the Lydian stone against which all other philosophies of nature must be evaluated. 41 It is obvious that the text of Physica harmonica adheres even closer to a literal reading of the Bible - a signifi  cant part of the fi  rst chapter of the treatise on Mosaic physics is devoted to a verse libris  decem.

For  similar  reasoning,  see  the  fi  rst  and  the fourth parts of the same treatise: ibid., 19, 187-88.\n- 38 Alsted, Physica harmonica , 172, 216.\n- 39 Alsted, Systema physicae harmonicae , 143-71; Alsted, Physica harmonica , 132-214.\n- 40 Moreover, Hotson argues that Alsted's interest in alchemy and its public defence disappears in the following years almost entirely. See Hotson, Johann Heinrich Alsted , 95-96. For possible sources of Alsted's conception of Physica chemica , see ibid., 92-94.\n- 41 Alsted, Physica harmonica , 5.\n\nby  verse  recount  of  Genesis  1. 42 Th roughout  the  text,  Alsted  stresses  the facticity of creatio ex nihilo (analysing terms such as in principio or creavit ). 43\n\nHowever, the Mosaic parts of Physica harmonica published in 1616 still bear evidence to Alsted's vacillation between Mosaic and Aristotelian natural philosophy. In this writing, again, he was not entirely able to abandon the Aristotelian philosophical framework and its terminology in order to present a coherent system of Mosaic natural philosophy. Although Alsted proposed a harmony of the four dominant traditions of natural philosophy, it  is  a  serious  question  whether Mosaic physics, Rabbinic physics and Alchemical physics were treated as equal systems, or merely as teachings not repugnant to the prevailing Aristotelian discourse. In other words, while Alsted's  exposition  of  Peripatetic  physics  would  without  any  doubt  stand without its Mosaic components (which were mostly related to cosmological and natural-historical marginalia, as we have seen), his entire Mosaic account rested strongly on Aristotle. 44\n\n## 3. Th e Biblical Encyclopaedia (1625)\n\nHoward  Hotson  documented  in  detail  the  shift    in  Alsted's  scholarly interest from philosophy to theology that took place around 1615, to be completed by his theological encyclopaedia Methodus theologiae (1623). 45  From the point of view of natural philosophy and of other 'profane' disciplines, it is, however, much more important to look into Alsted's biblical encyclopaedia which was published in 1625 in Frankfurt am Main under the title Triumphus Bibliorum Sacrorum seu Encyclopaedia Biblica . 46\n\nAs  Alsted  declares,  this  encyclopaedia  is  primarily  based  on  a  literal reading of the texts of the Old Testament and the New Testament, as, in his opinion, the foundations of an entire philosophy can be found in the Bible. 47\n\n- 42 Alsted, Physica harmonica , 8-12.\n- 43 Alsted, Physica harmonica , 18-19. Cf. also ibid., 272.\n- 44 For a similar evaluation, see Hotson, Commonplace Learning , 233-34.\n- 45 Johann  Heinrich  Alsted, Methodus  sancrosanctae  theologiae  octo  libris  tradita (Hanau: Conrad Eifrid, 1623); Hotson, Johann Heinrich Alsted ,  121-23. See further Howard Hotson and Maria Rosa Antognazza, Alsted and Leibniz on God, the Magistrate, and the Millennium (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 1999), 19-32.\n- 46 Johann Heinrich Alsted, Triumphus Bibliorum sacrorum seu Encyclopaedia Biblica exhibens Triumphum  philosophiae, iurisprudentiae, et medicinae sacrae, itemque, sacrosanctae theologiae,  quatenus  illarum  fundamenta  ex  Scriptura  V.  et  N.  T.  colliguntur (Francofurti: Bartholomaeus Schmidt, 1625).\n\n47 Alsted, Triumphus , 2-5.\n\nBesides the Biblical references, Alsted frequently relies on his Mosaic predecessors and contemporaries, namely Konrad Heresbach (1496-1576), Levinus Lemnius (1505-1568), Francisco Vallés (1524-1592), Lambert Daneau (1530-1595),  Otto  Casman  (1562-1607),  Johannes  Althusius  (1563-1638), Conrad Aslacus (Kort Aslakssøn, or Axelson; 1564-1624), etc. 48 It must be noted,  however,  that  Alsted  also  frequently  employs  Patristic  authorities (e.g.,  Origen,  Tertullian,  Clemens  of  Alexandria,  Gregory  of  Nazianzus, Basil of Caesarea, John Chrysostom, Ambrose, Augustine) 49 and - what is more important - does not entirely omit profane and 'gentile' authorities (fi  rst of all, again, Aristotle). 50\n\nFurthermore, Alsted's biblical encyclopaedia is not 'biblical' in a strict sense with respect to the sources of knowledge its author recommends. In fact,  he  recognizes two lights, metaphorically speaking: the light of grace ( lumen gratiae ) and the light of nature ( lumen naturae ), i.e., the Bible as the revealed truth and the created world, or the book of nature, ( liber naturae ) to be investigated by the senses, observation, experience, and induction. 51 For this reason, I disagree with Howard Hotson's characteristic of Triumphus as a work founded 'exclusively on the text of Holy Scripture,' i.e., a proof of the 'collapse of Alsted's youthful eclecticism'; we can clearly see that Alsted\n\n48 Ibid., Praefatio .  Most  probably,  Alsted  was  infl  uenced  by  the  following  works:  Konrad Heresbach, Christianae  iurisprudentiae  epitome (Neostadii  in  Palatinatu:  Harnisch,  1586); Levinus Lemnius, Similitudinum ac parabolarum quae in Bibliis ex herbis  atque  arboribus desumuntur dilucida explicatio (Antverpiae: [s.n.], 1568); Francisco Vallés, De iis, quae scripta sunt physice in libris sacris, sive de sacra philosophia (Lugduni: Franciscus Le Fevre, 1588); Lambert  Daneau, Physica  christiana (Lyon:  Pierre  de  Saint-André,  1576);  Otto  Casmann, Cosmopoeia et Ouranographia christiana (Francofurti:  Palthenius,  1598);  id., Biographia et commentatio methodica, prior de hominis vita naturali, morali et oeconomica; indeque deducta ethica et oeconomica theosophica (Francofurti: Palthenius, 1602); Johannes Althusius, Civilis conversationis libri II (Hanoviae: Antonius, 1601); Conrad Aslacus, Physica et ethica mosaica (Hanoviae: Typis Wechelianis, apud haeredes Ioannis Aubrii, 1613).

As Alsted claims, these two ways were approved by the Apostle in Romans 1:16, 15:4.\n\ndid  not  cease  to  base  his  expositions  on  various  and  oft  en  contradictory sources. 52\n\nConcerning the structure and content, the division of Alsted's biblical encyclopaedia resembles in many ways the layout of his much more wellknown masterpiece, Encyclopaedia septem tomis distincta published 1630 in Herborn and reprinted 1649 in Lyon. 53 Th e Triumphus consists of sections devoted to the preliminary Praecognita (i.e., Archeologia sacra , Hexiologia sacra , Technologia  sacra , Didactica  sacra ); Scientiae ( Metaphysica  sacra , Pneumatica sacra , Physica sacra , Arithmetica sacra , Geometria sacra , Cosmographia sacra , Uranoscopia sacra , Geographia sacra , Optica sacra , Musica sacra , Architectonica sacra ); Disciplinae practicae ( Ethica sacra , Oeconomica sacra , Politica sacra , Scholastica sacra ); Disciplinae philologicae ( Lexica sacra , Grammatica sacra , Rhetorica sacra , Logica sacra , Oratoria sacra , Poëtica sacra , Mnemonica sacra );  and the three superior disciplines, i.e., Jurisprudentia sacra , Medicina sacra and Th   eologia sacra . To the main body of the biblical encyclopaedia Alsted also adds a considerable amount of material related to other mixed disciplines. 54\n\nIn order to investigate the natural-philosophical passages of Triumphus closely, we shall begin with the chapters devoted to Physica sacra . Th is discipline comprises the knowledge of natural bodies ( corpus naturale ) that is derived primarily from Holy Scripture, especially from Genesis 1. In the text of Physica sacra Alsted verse by verse renders and interprets the narrative of the six days of creation (e.g., argues that the Latin verb creavit means 'ex nihilo fecit,' etc.); moreover, he adds a literal recount of Genesis 2. 55\n\nIn  contrast  to  his  earlier  texts  focused  on  natural  philosophy,  in Triumphus Alsted divides Physica sacra into ten individual parts: physica generalis (dealing with the principles of the world: fi  rst of all with the twofold primaeval matter, i.e., heavenly and earthly) ; physica specialis (dealing with light  and  the  stars); botanica (where  Alsted  only  provides  a  list  of  plants based on references in Holy Scripture); oryctologia (a list and description of minerals and metals); meteorologia ; ichthyologia ; ornithologia ; theriologia ;\n\n52 Cf. Hotson, Johann Heinrich Alsted , 122. On pages 138-39, Hotson is, however, more specifi  c when he states with reference to Alsted: 'What he hopes to demonstrate is not that all the principles of the arts and sciences are found in scripture but that some principles of each art and science can be found in scripture.'\n\n53 Similarly, see Hotson, Johann Heinrich Alsted , 137, 141-42; Hotson, Commonplace Learning , 196-97.\n\n54 Alsted, Triumphus , 11-15.\n\n55 Ibid., 61-67.\n\nanthropologia ;  and cosmologia consisting  mainly  of  a  treatise  on  the  four causes of the world, namely effi ciens (God), fi  nis (fi  rst  of  all  God's  glory), materia (primaeval matter), and forma (disposition  of  individual  parts  of the world). 56\n\nIn  general,  Alsted's  commentary  on  Mosaic  (or  biblical)  physics  in Triumphus oscillates  between  a  biblical  literalism  on  the  one  hand  and a persisting inclination to Aristotelianism on the other - as in the author's early  writings Systema  physicae  harmonicae and Physica  harmonica .  To give  an  example, in Physica sacra ,  Alsted claims that the Sun, the Moon, and the stars consist of light while, at the same time, praising Aristotle for estimating that the heavens are comprised of the fi  ft  h element. 57 And even more striking Aristotelian motifs can be found: e.g., the description of vita vegetativa in plants, vita sensitiva in animals and vita intellectiva in humans (which is divided into active and passive intellect and will). 58 Last but not least, in the 59 th section of Triumphus focused on Praedicamenta sacra , Alsted argues that the ten Aristotelian categories can be derived from the text of Holy Scripture. 59\n\nAlthough Alsted declared his intention to rely primarily (if not solely) on the Bible, it is evident that in his Biblical encyclopaedia he includes not only other divine sources (e.g., the Fathers) but also profane authorities led by Aristotle himself. Th e sacred, or Mosaic, physics introduced in Triumphus Bibliorum Sacrorum can thus be regarded as another of Alsted's peculiar mixtures of a biblical account with an observable Aristotelian framework.\n\nLet us state further that Alsted's laboured attempt to establish any discipline indeed on a literal reading of the Bible can be, by way of illustration, also  demonstrated  on  his  conception  of Medicina  sacra .  Th is  knowledge, Alsted claims, can be summed up primarily from the ninth chapter of the Gospel according to Matthew where Jesus forgives and heals a paralysed man. Besides God's will and mercy, the means to achieve good health is either proper nourishment, movement, and rest ( dieta ) or therapy ( remedium praeservativum ).  Th e latter consists in discerning the disease (its moral or natural causes) and in choosing an adequate remedy. Its application must be pious: that means, it must not rely on profane medicine (as a negative\n\n56 Ibid., 67-104.\n\n57 Ibid.,  69-70, 75-76. Th is  oscillation  may correspond with Alsted's current distinction of coelum supremum , coelum medianum (where the stars are located) and coelum infi  mum (the sphere of air). Cf. ibid., 71-72, 76.\n\n58 Ibid., 103-4.\n\n59 Ibid., 592-97.\n\ninstance, Alsted mentions Asa in 2 Chronicles 16:12-13) or on the Devil and his power, but exclusively on God and his prescriptions incorporated into the Bible. E.g., surgeons may be inspired by the story of the Samaritan narrated in the tenth chapter of the Gospel according to Luke, who bandaged wounds and poured oil and wine on them. 60\n\n## 4. Th e Mature Encyclopaedia (1630)\n\nAn  exposition  of  physics  also  plays  a  signifi  cant  role  in  Alsted's  mature encyclopaedic  project, Encyclopaedia  septem  tomis  distincta published  in 1630 in Herborn. Th e Physica is introduced in its third volume dealing with theoretical philosophy (i.e., Metaphysica , Pneumatica , Physica , Arithmetica , Geometria , Cosmographia , Uranometria , Geographia , Optica and Musica ). Although  Alsted  speaks  even  here  about  the  fourfold  harmony  between the Mosaic, Peripatetic, Alchemical and Poëtic (sic!) natural philosophy, 61 Aristotle becomes more than ever the principal authority for his reasoning, while the Mosaic aspects are signifi  cantly marginalised.\n\nIn  the Encyclopaedia , Physica is  understood  as  knowledge  of  natural bodies  ( corpus  naturale ),  or  substances  ( substantia )  consisting  of  matter and form. 62 Although in the further description Alsted occasionally refers to Moses (e.g., claims that primaeval matter aft  er its creation consisted of an inseparable connection of the heavenly and earthly parts; with respect to privation he mentions the Mosaic narrative and its parts related to Tohu Vabohu or abyssus ), 63 all the substantial aspects of natural philosophy in the Encyclopaedia are understood in a Peripatetic way: Alsted operates with the four causes, the distinction between substance and accident, the division of the universe into sublunary and superlunary sphere, etc. 64\n\nIn Alsted's view, the whole of nature is based on natural bodies ( corpus naturale ),  which are either simple, i.e., the celestial sphere or the four elements (earth, water, air, and fi  re), or complex. Regarding the substance of\n\n60 Ibid., 281-86.\n\n61 Th   e Physica poëtica harmonica was, in fact, already a part of Alsted's Physica harmonica of 1616. See Alsted, Physica harmonica , 271-81. Already in this earlier attempt Alsted focused on demonstrating the harmony between (mostly ancient) authors and natural philosophers with respect to their understanding of nature.\n\n62 Alsted, Encyclopaedia septem tomis distincta , 668-69.\n\n63 Ibid., 672-78. For Tohu Vabohu and abyssus , see Genesis 1:2.\n\n64 Ibid., 669-89. Some alien aspects, such as the Paracelsian triad of hypostatic principles, i.e., sal , sulphur , mercurium , can still be identifi  ed, too. Cf. ibid., 674-75.\n\nthe heavens, Alsted now departs from both his earlier Mosaic interpretation and from the standard Aristotelian cosmology when he identifi  es the matter of the heavens with substantial light ( lux substantialis ), or the quintessence ( quinta essentia )  created during the fi  rst day of creation. All the stars, including the Sun and the Moon, therefore, consist of light. 65\n\nFrom the point of view of the four sublunary elements, Alsted's exposition adheres fi  rmly to Aristotelian physics (two heavy and two light elements; the theories of natural motion and natural place). 66 Th e very same can be stated about complex bodies: Alsted names the vegetative, sensitive and rational souls located in plants, animals and humans (or animal rationale ) respectively. 67 In these passages, Alsted draws intensively on the works of Zabarella, Timpler, and fi  rst and foremost J. C. Scaliger. 68\n\nAlthough the Aristotelian pattern indisputably dominates in the fi  rst seven sections of Alsted's mature treatise on physics (i.e . , Physica generalis ; De corpore simplici ; Mictologia &amp; Meteorologia ; Nerterologia ; Empsychologia &amp; Phytologia ; Zoologia, Th erologia &amp; Anthropologia ; Physiognomia ), his - to some extent still persisting - fascination with the Mosaic account is revealed in the eight section, dedicated to cosmogony and cosmology. In Cosmologia , a brief and concise treatise, Alsted bases his description of the Creation on a literal reading of the Book of Genesis, the Gospel according to John, the Acts of the Apostles, and other biblical texts: God is understood as the effi   cient  cause  of  the  world,  its  architect  who  created  heavens  and  earth ex nihilo (in  the  form  of  primaeval  matter) and subsequently, during the six days of creation, the entire universe. 69\n\nNevertheless,  Alsted  acknowledges  Aristotelian  natural  philosophy even in this section, for instance when trying to harmonize the Christian doctrine  of  the  temporariness  of  the  world  with  Aristotle's  statements from his Physics , Metaphysics , On Generation and Corruption ,  and On the\n\n65 Ibid., 689-91.\n\n66 Ibid., 691-99.\n\n67 Ibid., 730-63.\n\n- 68 Ibid. Compare also Alsted's early work Systema physicae harmonicae of  1612 (esp. pages 67-175) with Julius Caesar Scaliger, Exotericarum exercitationum libri XV de subtilitate (fi  rst edition Paris, 1557; I analysed the edition Francofurti: Impensis Claudii Marni &amp; Consortum, 1612). For Alsted's sources in his late encyclopaedia(s) in general, see Hotson, Commonplace Learning , 202-24.\n\n69 Alsted, Encyclopaedia septem tomis distincta ,  780-81.  Note  that  Alsted's  name  appeared on a treatise named Cosmologia already in 1611. In this case, however, it was a disputation of Samuel Gessinius presided by Alsted. Cf. Johann Heinrich Alsted (praes.) - Samuel Gessinius (resp.), Cosmologia (Herbornae: [Christoph Corvinus], 1611).\n\nHeavens . 70 On the other hand, he strictly defends the facticity of the six-day creation  (or,  of  Moses's  testimony)  against  such  authorities  as  Augustine, Philo and Jean Bodin. 71 Holy Scripture, Alsted emphasizes, also serves as a proof that the world is just one; to sum up: 'Scripture accurately describes the creation of the world.' 72\n\nFinally, Alsted also incorporated a treatise dealing with Physica Mosis, Jobi,  et  Davidis ,  or physica  sacra into  his Encyclopaedia .  In  this  concise text (only two folio columns, in fact) he briefl  y summarises the six days of creation based on an interpretation of Genesis 1 and natural-philosophical passages of the Book of Job and the Psalms (esp. 104). Nonetheless, Alsted states that 'the key and the foundation of physics is the Hexameron, i.e., the fi   rst chapter of Genesis.' 73\n\nIn  general,  however,  Alsted's  conception  of  natural  philosophy  presented in the whole of his mature Encyclopedia shows that Aristotle and his successors had become the leading authority in this fi  eld for him. 74\n\n70 Alsted, Encyclopaedia septem tomis distincta , 781. From the cosmological point of view, also in this section of physics light is understood as the quintessence; in other words, Alsted still oscillates between the Mosaic narrative and an orthodox Aristotelianism. Cf. ibid., 782.\n\n71 As  a  matter of interest, Alsted argues against Gerardus Mercator that the world was not created in July,  but  in  March  because  this  part  of  the  year  is  the  most  beautiful  and  most suitable  for  yielding  both  animals  and  plants.  Furthermore,  in  the Chronologia section  of his Encyclopaedia , Alsted specifi  es that the world was created on the spring equinox, i.e., on 25 th  of March 3947 BCE. Cf. Alsted, Encyclopaedia septem tomis distincta , 782, 2108. For the canonical treatise related to the discussion of the exact date of the creation of the world, see James Ussher, Annales Veteris Testamenti, a prima mundi origine deducti, una cum rerum Asiaticarum et Aegyptiacarum chronico, a temporis historici principio usque ad Maccabaicorum initia producto (Londoni: Ex offi cina J. Flesher &amp; prostant in ædibus G. Bedell, prope januam Medii Templi in platea dicta Fleetstreet, 1650), 1, who argues for 23 rd  October 4004 BCE.\n\n72 Alsted, Encyclopaedia septem tomis distincta , 784: 'Scriptura accuratè describit creationem mundi.'\n\n73 Ibid., 2350: 'Clavis et fundamentum physicae est hexaëmeron, seu primum caput Genesis.' Moreover, the subsequent chapter of Encyclopaedia is  devoted to Th   eosophia et philosophia Salomonis where Alsted gives a list  of  philosophical  and  theological  commonplaces  which can be derived from Solomonic biblical texts ( Ecclesiastes , Proverbs , Th   e Book of Wisdom ). See ibid., 2351-55.\n\n74 From the point of view of the earlier version of Alsted's mature encyclopaedia, the Cursus philosophici  encyclopaedia of  1620,  Jaromír  Červenka  and  Howard  Hotson  have  already shown  that  its  conception  of  natural  philosophy  is  mainly  Aristotelian  and  that  (quoting Hotson) a 'closer examination reveals that Alsted has redistributed material from the Mosaic, Kabbalistic, and especially the alchemical physics to augment this Aristotelian core wherever possible.'  See  Hotson, Commonplace  Learning ,  234-35;  Červenka, Die  Naturphilosophie , 38-39. For a general comparison of the 1620 and 1630 editions, see Hotson, Commonplace Learning , 196-99, 246-73. For other aspects of Alsted's natural philosophy in Encyclopaedia\n\n## 5. Conclusion\n\nIn her above-mentioned paper, Ann Blair stated that albeit Mosaic philosophers shared a joint endeavour to establish a brand new natural philosophy which would be freed from a 'slavish adherence to Aristotle, Plato, and every other philosopher,' they 'did not always practice what they preached and in the end also relied on Aristotelian categories.' 75 Concerning the natural philosophy of Johann Heinrich Alsted, I argue that his indebtedness to Aristotelianism was even more essential. Although in his early works on this topic Alsted declares as his primary aim proving the harmony and equality  between various traditions of natural philosophy, namely between the Mosaic and the Peripatetic approaches, and despite the fact that his biblical encyclopaedia of 1625 was intended to be built on the basis of a literal reading of the Bible, Alsted never truly abandoned the Aristotelian framework of his physics. What is more, in his mature Encyclopaedia of 1630, he eventually (to a remarkable extent) openly preferred Aristotle to other naturalphilosophical traditions, including Mosaic physics which became evidently marginalised. 76 As Howard Hotson has shown, in the mature edition of the Encyclopaedia of  1630,  the  disciplines  inconsistent  with  its  philosophical core  were  relocated  to  the  last,  seventh  volume  dealing  with  mixtures  of disciplines ( farragines disciplinarum ), or 'a bizarre mêlée of miscellaneous and even contradictory material.' In other words, Alsted eventually abandons, at least publicly, his early fascination with esoteric teachings (the art of memory, alchemy), and Mosaic physics, too, and resorts to the prevailing Aristotelian discourse. 77\n\n(namely the conception of space), see Cees Leijenhorst, 'Place, Space and Matter in Calvinist Physics,' Th   e Monist 84, no. 4 (2001): 532-34.\n\n75 Blair, 'Mosaic Physics,' 35, 47. Similarly, see Donald Sinnema, 'Aristotle and Early Reformed Orthodoxy: Moments of Accommodation and Antithesis,' in Christianity and the Classics: Th   e Acceptance of a Heritage , ed. Wendy Helleman (New York: University Press of America, 1990), 119-48.\n\n76 For  a  similar  but  rather laconic conclusion, see Michel, Der Herborner Philosoph Johann Heinrich  Alsted ,  6:  'In  Wirklichkeit  wird  nicht  die  Lehre  der  Bibel  dargelegt,  sondern Aristoteles  in  die  Bibel  hineingedeutet.'  Besides  that,  Michel  proves  that  Aristotelianism played a crucial role also in Alsted's conception of metaphysics. Cf. ibid., 118-27.\n\n77 Hotson, Johann Heinrich Alsted ,  37-39,  90-94,  152-53;  Hotson, Commonplace Learning , 254-73  (for  natural  philosophy,  see  esp.  264-65).  For  general  characteristics  of  Alsted's lifelong eclecticism with syncretic tendencies, see Hotson, Commonplace Learning ,  237-39: 'Alsted's writings, viewed philosophically, tend to be either uninteresting (because derived from  a  narrow  range  of  authors)  or  incoherent  (because  derived  from  many  incompatible\n\nLet  us  mention  that  already  the  early  modern  writer  Daniel  Georg Morhof states in his work Polyhistor (fi  rst edition Lübeck, 1688) that neither Alsted nor any of his Mosaic contemporaries followed any specifi  c rules, and that they either only commented on the fi  rst chapter of Genesis or reduced the Peripatetic and common natural philosophy to supposed Mosaic principles ( ad Mosaica illa reducunt ). 78\n\nMoreover, Alsted's unsuccessful attempt to establish physics primarily on the Mosaic basis can be seen as a confi  rmation of Johann Franz Buddeus's evaluation of Mosaic physics in general: 'Many of those who tried to follow the rules of Christian philosophy did nothing else than confi  rm and support the scholastic doctrine which they extracted through and through from the Holy Scripture.' 79\n\nAlthough Alsted's concept of physica Mosaica was indisputably unsuccessful rather than a viable and promising project of early modern natural philosophy, we should modify the evaluation of Alsted's (natural) philosophy expressed by the former generation of scholars as a 'bigoted' or 'decisive' Aristotelianism as too narrow and overlooking the non-Aristotelian components (and desires) of his philosophy. 80 Finally, as Peter Harrison argues, the inclination to Mosaic natural philosophy in its various forms testifi  es that modern science emerged during the early modern era also in dialogue with religion - that 'consonance with scripture became an important means of supporting new philosophical speculations.' 81\n\nones). In the latter case one can admire the richness of the mixture, but one cannot expound it as a philosophical system.'\n\n- 78  Daniel Georg Morhof, Polyhistor, literarius, philosophicus et practicus.
