Introduction\n\nThe  most  important  figure  among  Russia's  radical  Marxists  was  A.A. Bogdanov (the pseudonym of Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Malinovskii). Not only was  he  the  prime  exponent  of  a  proletarian  cultural  revolution;  it  was Bogdanov's ideas which provided justification for concern for the environment. And his ideas are not only important to environmentalists because they were associated  with  this  conservation  movement;  more  significantly  they  are  of continuing relevance because they confront the root causes of environmental destruction in the present, and offer what is perhaps the only way to overcome these causes. 1  Bogdanov's career and ideas are therefore worth investigating in more depth.\n\n## 2. The Bogdanov's Life and Concerns\n\nBogdanov is historically significant in a number of different contexts. 2  Born in August, 1873 into the family of a teacher in Sokolko, Province of Grodno, 3 Bogdanov first studied natural sciences at the University of Moscow and then medicine at the University of Kharkov from which he graduated in 1899. But even before graduating he had become a radical political activist. In 1894 he was banished from Moscow University to Tula for his part in a student protest. He joined pro-revolutionary movements and from 1896 onwards worked as a revolutionary  propagandist.  Originally  a  Narodnik,  Bogdanov  soon  became  a Marxist.  By  the  winter  of  1895-96  he  had  become  a  social  democrat  by conviction,  and  he  joined  the  Social  Democratic  Party  in  1898.  However  he remained  sympathetic  to  anti-centralist  and  anti-State  sentiments  of  the Narodniks, and later embraced many of the ideas of the anarcho-syndicalists. He continued his work as a propagandist after his graduation in 1899 and was arrested  and  sent  into  exile  to  Vologda  in  1901.  In  1904  he  was  one  of  the founders of the Bolsheviks, and until his expulsion in 1909, Bogdanov was the Bolsheviks' second in command and the faction's principle leader in Russia. In the  uprising  of  1905  he  was  the  chief  Bolshevik  and  a  leader  in  the  St. Petersburg  Soviet,  and  was  arrested  and  jailed  until  the  summer  of  1906. Together  with  Lenin,  Bogdanov  founded,  and  then  became  editor  of  the Bolshevik journal Vpered (Forward). The polemic between Lenin and Bogdanov associated  with  their  break  was  one  of  the  most  important  chapters  in  the history  of  Bolshevism.  Bogdanov  led  a  group  of  left-wing  Marxists,  the Vperedists ,  a  group  which  included  the  future  heads  of  the  Commissariat  of Enlightenment,  A.  Lunacharskii  and  M.  Pokrovskii,  and  the  author,  Maxim Gor'kii. It was in the platform of this group that the slogan \"proletarian culture\" was first  formulated.  Lenin  devoted an entire year to writing Materialism  and\n\n1   I  have  tried  to  reformulate  Marxism  in  the  spirit  of  Bogdanov  to  address  the  environmental  crisis  in Beyond European Civilization: Marxism, Process Philosophy and the Environment ,  (Bundgendore, Australia: Eco-Logical Press, 1993).\n\n2   Bogdanov  wrote  a  brief  autobiography  describing  his  main  political  involvements  and  his  main  intellectual achievements.  This  is  translated  in  Georges  Haupt  and  Jean-Jacques  Marie, Makers  of  the  Russian  Revolution: Biographies of Bolshevik Leaders , tr. C.I.P. Ferdinand and D.M. Bellos (Ithaca and New York: Cornell University Press, 1974).\n\n3   George  Gorelik,  \"Introduction\",  A.  Bogdanov, Essays  in  Tektology:  The  General  Science  of  Organization (2nd  ed., Seaside: Cal.: Intersystems Publications, 1984), p.i. Most writers on Bogdanov mistakenly give Tula as his birthplace.\n\nEmpiro-Criticism to refute \"Bogdanov and Co.\", 4  and Lenin continued to regard Bogdanov  as  his  main  rival  for  the  allegiance  of  left-wing  Marxists  after  the revolution  in  1917.  Bogdanov's  ideas  provided  the  matrix  for  the  \"cultural Marxist\" alternative to Plekhanov-Leninism even after Lenin's death.\n\nBogdanov was also a major intellectual figure. While still a student he wrote a  book  on  economics  and  developed  an  original  interpretation  of  Marx's economic  theory, 5   and  then  published  another  on  philosophy.  He  wrote  on knowledge  and  culture  and  was  the  most  original  proponent  of  the  effort  to weld  Marx's  social  theory  with  the  \"scientific  philosophy\"  of  neo-positivism. 6 But he was also influenced, at least indirectly, by Georges Sorel and Friedrich Nietzsche,  and  was  concerned  with  \"meaning  of  life\"  issues. 7   He  anticipated Western  Marxist  theorists of  culture  and  sociologists  of  knowledge  and systematically  analysed  the  genetic  and  functional  relationships  between ideology  and  social  structure  through  history  and  laid  the  foundations  for  a general theory of organization, foreshadowing the development of cybernetics, general systems theory and praxiology. 8\n\nFinally, combining his political and intellectual work, Bogdanov participated in  the  organization  (along  with  the  other Vperedists ) of  the  first  socialdemocratic party schools at Capri in 1909 and Bologna in 1910. He became the principle  proponent  of  the  view  that  it  was  necessary  to  develop  a  new proletarian culture which would be the future socialist culture, and set forth a practical programme for this in Cultural Tasks of Our Time , published in 1910. In  this  project  he  called  for  the  establishment  of  a  worker's  university  as  a comprehensive educational and scientific institution outside existing educational  institutions  designed  to  eventually  take  their  place,  and  for  the production of a proletarian encyclopaedia. After the revolution he founded the Moscow branch of the Proletarian Culture Movement (Proletkult), a movement formally  instituted  as  an  all-Russian  organization  in  1918. 9   This  movement, which Bogdanov dominated, gained the allegiance of many of Russia's leading writers and artists, and by the end of 1920 had between 400,000 and 500,000 members  and  had  established  a  Proletarian  University.  Bogdanov's  ideas continued to influence education after Lenin had reined in and then destroyed Proletkult. 10   As  Sochor has pointed out: \"Even those who criticized Bogdanov during the 1920s conceded that, despite all the controversy, he continued to\n\n4   Lenin's  motives  for  writing  this  were  complex.  David Joravsky argues that Lenin's primary concern was that the Bolsheviks  be  seen  as  orthodox.  See  Joravsky, Soviet  Marxism  and  Natural  Science:  1917  -  1932 (N.Y.:  Columbia University Press, 1961), p.33. However John Biggart argues that Lenin was trying to discredit Bogdanov as a Marxist to  reinforce  his  own  postition  in  the  Bolshevik  leadership.  (\"'Anti-Leninist  Bolshevism':  the Forward Group  of  the RSDRP,\" Canadian Slavonic Papers , 23, (2), June, 1981.\n\n5  Bogdanov's first book, A Short Course on Economic Science initially published in 1897, went through fifteen editions and was still being published and used as a text for students in 1924 when Bogdanov was coming under increasing criticism.\n\n6   K.M.  Jensen, Beyond  Marx  and  Mach:  Aleksandr  Bogdanov's  Philosophy  of  Living  Experience (Dordrecht:  Reidel, 1978).\n\n7   As  Zenovia  A  Sochor  has  argued,  \"A.A.  Bogdanov:  In  Search  of  Cultural  Liberation\"  in Nietzsche  in  Russia ,  ed. Bernice Glatzer Rosenthal (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1986).\n\n8   The best brief characterization of Bogdanov's theory of organizations is George Gorelik, \"Bogdanov's tektology: its basic concepts and relevance to modern generalizing sciences.\" Human Systems Management 1, 1980. Gorelik is the translator of Bogdanov's Essays in Tektology and has written a number of expository papers on Bogdanov. See also Rafael E. Bello, \"The Systems Approach - A. Bogdanov and L. Von Bertalanffy\", Studies in Soviet Thought , 30, 1985.\n\n9   See  Lynn  Mally, Culture of the Future: On the Proletkult Movement in Revolutionary Russia (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1990).\n\n10  This is evident in Sheila Fitzpatrick's study, The Commissariat of Enlightenment (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1970).\n\nattract 'a large number of young enthusiasts.'\" 11  In 1918 Bogdanov became the first  director  of  the  Socialist  Academy  of  Social  Science  (after  1924  the Communist Academy, a name change which Bogdanov opposed) and continued in that position until 1923. Despite his concern to create a proletarian culture, he took the side of the \"mechanists\" against the efforts of the \"dialecticians\" to impose a \"politically correct\" philosophy on scientists. 12  After Lenin's death in January,  1924  Bogdanov  was  asked  to  rejoin  the  Party  by  the  Bolshevik leaders  Zinoviev,  Kamenev  and  Bukharin,  who  hoped  to  bring  him  into collaboration  against  Stalin,  an  invitation  which,  perhaps  unfortunately,  he declined.  In  1926  Bogdanov  founded  the  first  Russian  Institute  for  Blood Transfusion. He died in 1928 after an experiment in which he exchanged his blood with a seriously ill patient.\n\nBogdanov's  concern  for  the  natural  limits  to  economic  development  were expressed in his utopian novel Red Star ,  published  in  1908.  On  the  basis  of this tract, Loren Graham commended Bogdanov's prescience in predicting the environmental problems which economic development would inevitably bring. 13 However  this  alone  would  hardly  justify  considering  Bogdanov  of  major significance to the environmental  movement.  Douglas  Weiner,  who  has provided  us  with  the  history  of  the  early  Soviet  conservation  movement,  has shown that the most important group in this movement were field naturalists and  ecologists,  and  that  the  individual  most  responsible  for  providing  the conditions  under  which  these  scientists  and  other  conservationists  could influence government was Anatolii Lunacharskii, the Commissar of Enlightenment. 14  Furthermore it was Lenin who provided an important initial impetus  to  the  conservation  movement.  He  supported  the  efforts  of  the ecologists  to  have  conservation  issues  addressed,  appointed  Lunacharskii Commissar  of  Enlightenment,  and  conferred  responsibility  for  administering conservation  matters  on  the  Commissariat  of  Enlightenment.  What  I  will suggest is that it was Bogdanov who offered the basic philosophical direction required  for  the  conservationists  to  flourish  and  who  helped  create  the intellectual milieu within which ideas in ecology could be developed to provide the intellectual foundation for the conservationists.\n\nBogdanov's significance in this regard is not appreciated because the range of his achievements and the diversity of the fields to which he contributed has blinded people to the interrelationship among all aspects of his work. Yet it is in the unity of his work, both intellectual and political, that his importance to the conservationists in the Soviet Union lies. What is unique about Bogdanov is that  while  anticipating  Western  Marxist  theorists  of  culture,  he  was  also  a scientist  concerned  to  see  humans  as  part  of  and  within  nature;  while developing  a  critical  sociology  of  knowledge  showing  how  science  has  been expressive of and implicated in oppressive social relations, he was proposing an alternative  form  of  science  appropriate  for  a  social  order  free  from  class domination;  and  while  being  a  highly  original  thinker,  he  was  also  an  active revolutionary who went some way towards realizing the ideals for which he was fighting. Although influenced by a great variety of thinkers, including Spencer and  Bergson,  Bogdanov  was  attempting  to  mediate  between  two  major traditions:  German  social  thought,  pre-eminently  the  work  of  Marx,  and\n\n11  Socher, 1988 , op.cit. p.56.\n\n12   On this see David Joravsky, Soviet  Marxism and Natural Science: 1917 - 1932 (N.Y.:  Columbia University Press, 1961).\n\n13   Loren R. Graham, \"Bogdanov's Inner Message\" in Alexander Bogdanov, Red Star: The First Bolshevik Utopia ,  ed. Loren R. Graham and Richard Stites (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1984).\n\n14  Douglas Weiner, Models of Nature: Ecology op.cit.\n\nGerman natural science as this was evolving towards its greatest achievements in the early twentieth century, and to transform the ideas of each tradition in the light of the other into a coherent world-orientation for political action and for  the  creation  of  new  form  of  society.  His  contribution  was  to  understand science as part of culture and of socio-economic formations, while simultaneously situating the dynamics of societies within the broader context of nature; and carrying this out as an integral part of his revolutionary work of creating a new social order. 15\n\n## 3. Bogdanov's Point of Departure\n\nBogdanov claimed that it was only with Marx's publication of A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy in 1859 that the foundations were laid for a scientific  study  of  the  structure  and  dynamics  of  human  society. 16   In  the following  four  decades  Marx  and  his  followers  had  successfully  explained  a mass  of  historical  developments.  However  Bogdanov  was  highly  critical  of Marxists who treated Marx's works as the embodiment of absolute and eternal truths.  He  equated  this  with  outmoded  authoritarian  and  religious  frames  of mind. To begin with, there were defects in Marx's ideas. His division between the  economic  base  and  the  superstructure  was  problematic.  The  notion  of forces of production was defined ambiguously. Sometimes it was taken to refer to just tools and equipment, at others to include the human social activity and the technological knowledge, skills and methods of labor required to use them. And no distinction was made between relations of production occurring in the actual labor process  and  relations associated  with  appropriation  of the produce.  \"Economic  structure\"  was  also  imprecisely  defined.  How  could  law, which defined legal relations of ownership, be relegated to the superstructure when it is the basic element in the articulation of the mode of production? And Marx  did  not  explain  why  every  society  needs  ideology,  or  show  what  is  the relationship  between  ideology  and  economy.  More  importantly,  revolutionary changes in the natural sciences, such as Darwin's theory of evolution, raised serious  questions  which  Marxists  could  not  ignore.  Marxist  theory  of  social change  needed  to  be  brought  into  relation  with  biological  theories  of  change and  with  the  new  scientific  psychology.  It  needed  to  take  a  stand  on  the accelerated mathematization of science, and it needed to give a place to energy.\n\nThe  most  important  scientific  influences  on  Bogdanov  were  the  Monists: Ernst Haeckel (1834-1919) - the biologist who coined the term ecology and who late in life founded the Monist League, 17  and Wilhelm Ostwald. 18  While Haeckel was the greatest exponent of Darwin's theory of evolution in Germany in the nineteenth century, and a supporter of eugenics, he was more fundamentally influenced  by  the Naturphilosophen ,  the  anti-mechanistic  philosophers  who strove  to  create  a  new  science  of  nature  in  the  late  eighteenth  and  early\n\n15  See Georgii Gloveli, \"'Socialism of Science' versus 'Socialism of Feelings': Bogdanov and Lunacharsky,\" Studies in Soviet Thought , 42, 1991.\n\n16   A.A.  Bogdanov, Iz  psikhologii  obschchestva [ From  the  Psychology  of  Society ],  (St.  Petersburg,  1904).  For  an exposition  of  Bogdanov's  arguments,  see  Alexander  Vucinich,  '\"A  Blend  of  Marxism  and  Neopositivism:  A.A. Bogdanov\", Social Thought in Tsarist Russia , (Chicago: University of Chicago Press), 1976, p.208ff.\n\n17  The importance of Haeckel to Bogdanov has been convincingly argued by Mark B. Adams, \"'Red Star': Another Look at Aleksandr Bogdanov,\" Slavic Review , 48, 1, 1989, p.10f.\n\n18  Alexander Vucinich in his chapter on Bogdanov in Social Thought in Tsarist Russia , op.cit. argues that Ostwald's energism was an enduring influence on all Bogdanov's work. See also Alexander Vucinich, Darwin in Russian Thought (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1988), p.367f.\n\nnineteenth  centuries. 19   In  particular  Haeckel  was  influenced  by  Goethe,  and referred  to  Lucretius,  Bruno  and  Spinoza as sources of his opposition to the dualism  between  Spirit  and  matter.  He  argued  that  they  had  all  shown  \"the oneness  of  the  cosmos,  the  indissociable  connection  between  energy  and matter ... mind and embodiment.\" 20  Haeckel's successor as the chief exponent of Monism and head of the Monist League in Germany, Ostwald, was the leader of  an  important group of scientists who were extending the ideas not only of Haeckel, but also of Mach, who argued against atomism on the grounds that all untestable  hypotheses  should  be  eliminated  from  science,  and  that  science should proceed by taking an intuitively plausible principle and then striving to harmonize  all  particular  ideas  with  this  principle.  Ostwald  argued  that  all observable phenomena should be reduced to  the principle of energy, and he proposed the development of all scientific fields in terms of energetics. 21  At first only inanimate matter was to be reduced to this principle, then the phenomena of life were included, and finally from 1900 onwards Ostwald attempted to deal with  psychological  phenomena  as  energetic  processes.  Integrating  Ostwald's program  into his  own  schema  of  concepts  and  propositions,  Bogdanov represented human society as an integral part of nature, an energetic process subject to self-adjusting natural processes which  could be scientifically measured, and he formulated in terms of this scheme an interpretation of the historical succession of social systems and a new theory of knowledge.\n\n## 4. Society as a Cultural Process Within Nature\n\nBogdanov's first  philosophical  work, Basic  Principles  of  a  Historical  View  of Nature published  in  1899,  argued  for  a  synthesis  of  Newton  and  Darwin,  or rather  Haeckel's  version  of  Darwin,  giving  a  central  place  to  energy  in  this synthesis.  This  program  was  further  developed  in  his  next  work, Knowledge from  a  Historical  Point  of  View published  in  1902.  In  these  books  Bogdanov argued  that  nature  and  society  together  are  perpetually  changing,  although without there being any purpose in this change, and the social sciences should be  based  on  natural  science  models.  This  was  essentially  an  extension  of Ostwald's  project  of  conceiving  everything  in  terms  of  the  transformation  of energy. 22  As Bogdanov understood it, the conservation of energy is the same as the  law  of  uniformity  and  continuity  of  natural  processes:  everything  must issue from something else. Accordingly, the basic task of science is to study the interaction  and  succession  of  natural  phenomena,  and  Bogdanov  saw  the energy theory of causation associated with this as one of the major innovations of nineteenth century science. Science is no longer concerned with cause and effect  as  distinct  phenomena,  but  with  the  processes  involved  in  causal sequences. The focus is shifted from the ontological to the functional aspects of nature;  modern  science  is  not  so  much  interested  in  what  things  are  but  in how they work. Extending this approach to humanity supports the historical approach  in the social sciences, placing  the  primary  emphasis  on  the\n\n19  For the source and structure of Haeckel's ideas and their importance for conservation, see Anna Bramwell, Ecology in the 20th Century: A History (New Haven and London: Yale Univesity Press, 1989), ch.3.\n\n20  E. Haeckel, Monism as Connecting Religion and Science. The Confessions of Faith of a Man of Science (London and Edinburgh, 1894), p.5.\n\n21   On  Ostwald,  see  Yehuda  Elkana,  \"Bolzmann's  Scientific  Research  Program  and  its  Alternatives\", The Interaction between Science and Philosophy , ed. Y. Elkana (Atlantic Highlands, N.J.: Humanities Press, 1974), pp.243-279, p.265.\n\n22  It was not only the second book that was written under the influence of Ostwald, as Vucinich suggests. Bogdanov makes clear that Basic Principles was also written under Ostwald's influence in Empiriomonizm Vol. III (St. Petersburg, 1906), p.xvii footnote. This is pointed out by Karl G. Ballestrem, \"Lenin and Bogdanov\", Studies in Soviet Thought 9, 1969, p.308 n.3.\n\ninteraction of social processes, particularly the relationship between technology and  ideology.  The  key  process  revealing  the  regularities  of  social  change  is adaptation, the main mechanism of which is the social selection of the most effective techniques for the satisfaction of changing social needs. All phenomena  of  social  dynamics  are  specific  adaptations  to  increases  and decreases in social energy, and as with other organic phenomena, there is a spontaneous tendency to eliminate contradictory tendencies and to strengthen harmonious  relations.  However  this  heavy  dependence  on  natural  science models did not mean that Bogdanov thought that the social sciences could be reduced to physics or biology. Mental life was seen as the most complex form of biological  development,  and  sociality  a  higher  manifestation  of  such  mental development. The uniqueness of each level of development must be appreciated.  Furthermore,  a  sociologist  cannot  conduct  experiments  and confronts  the  infinitely  complex  concrete  details  of  social  life.  To  go  beyond description, social scientists must resort to an abstract method which is both deductive and historical to reveal the \"tendencies\" of social processes.\n\nIn Knowledge  from  an  Historical  Point  of  View Bogdanov  was  concerned primarily  with  applying  the  energy  approach  to  the  study  of  the  evolution  of knowledge. For Bogdanov economic life is an integral part of social being, and social being is identical to social consciousness; therefore it is knowledge which is  the  moving  force  of  history  and  the  main  line  of  social  progress.  Taking knowledge  as  a  sociological  rather  than  an  epistemological  phenomenon,  he argued that the study of the inner dynamics of social relations is equivalent to the  study  the  development  of  knowledge:  \"An  analysis  of  cooperation  within individual groups provides the basis for a study of general forms of knowledge, characteristic for the entire society; an analysis of cooperation within individual groups provides the basis for the study of special ideological tendencies.\" 23  In his  later  writings  the  categories  \"social  being\"  and  \"social  consciousness\"  are merged in the category \"culture\". 24  The central theme of Bogdanov's sociology are then the regularities in social changes as recorded in cognitive culture.\n\nReformulating Marx, he argued that social being has two levels, the technical and  the  organizational.  The  organization  of  activity  at  the  technical  level generates  technical  knowledge  or  technology.  For  Bogdanov,  \"technology\" denotes  not material equipment  but  the  organization  and  utilization of knowledge  related  to  external  nature.  As  the  technical  level  became  more complex,  humans  came  to  need  organizational  forms.  This  is  the  realm  of ideology, or what has been called in idealist philosophy, the realm of spirit concepts,  thought,  norms,  all  of  those  things  which  are  called  ideas  in  the broadest  sense  of  the  word.  Bogdanov  saw  no  essential  difference  between technical and ideological labor. Both exert effort against resistance; in the case of ideological labor, against the labor nature of humans. He was concerned to give  due  recognition  to  both  technology  and  ideology  in  the  advancement  of society; they are correlates. Techniques are the very essence of human social existence  and  the  primary  matrix  of  social  relations,  but  ideology,  the  entire sphere of social life outside the technical process, is also a vital social force.\n\n23  A.A.

Bogdanov, \"Razvitie zhizni v prirode i v obschchestve\", in Iz psikhologii obshchestva [ From the Psychology of Society ] (St. Petersburg, 1904). This development is described by John Biggart in \"Marxism and Social Anthropology\", Studies in Soviet Thought 24, 1982, pp.1-9, esp. p.4. Biggart argues that this could have been an indirect source of inspiration for the American school of \"cultural materialists\" (Leslie White, Julian Steward, Betty Meggars and Marvin Harris).\n\n## 5. Knowledge as the Organization of Experience\n\nTo develop this conception of society required more attention to the nature of knowledge. Bogdanov turned to the empirio-criticism of Ernst Mach, Ostwald's source of inspiration, and of Richard Avenarius, synthesizing their epistemological  views  with  Marx's  theory  of  social  history  to  formulate  an original  theory  of  knowledge  which  he  called  empiriomonism. 25   However  this did not involve abandoning Ostwald's energism, although this was pushed into the background, and it reinforced his commitment to the Monism of Haeckel and  Ostwald.  Bogdanov  signified  by  the  \"monism\"  of  his  \"empiriomonism,\"  a world-view guided by a single comprehensive principle, which provides a key to all  understanding  and  is  applicable  to  the  natural  as  well  as  the  social sciences, so that reality can be experienced as one unitary organic whole, with all its parts interrelated. 26\n\nAlong with the empirio-critics Bogdanov fully embraced the idea that what is real is experience, and that the goal of knowledge is to orient people therein. He also accepted the empirio-critics doctrine that experience comprises things and mental representations - it is not to be equated with sensations in the minds of individuals. However following Marx, that is, Marx understood as a philosopher of  praxis  rather  than  as  a  materialist,  Bogdanov  qualified  this,  arguing  from \"the labor point of view\" or \"the point of view of collective labor activity\", that experience is the sum total of all human effort and resistance to that effort. 27 While the empirio-critics called for the analysis of experience into its component  parts  or  elements  to  discover  their  bonds  and  relationships, Bogdanov argued that the components of experience are not a priori elements; there  are  many  possible  ways  to  divide  experience  into  elements,  some  more useful  than  others.  Elements  are  separated  out  to  accord  with  the  needs  of production, they are the product of a certain amount and type of effort directed against a certain amount and type of resistance. Such activity is first physical and then mental; one first makes a brick as a physical element and then forms the  idea  of  it.  Matter,  argued  Bogdanov,  is  a  mere  abstraction,  a  metaphor designating that which resists labor.\n\nBogdanov also claimed there were weaknesses in the empirio-critics' analysis of  the  relation  between mind and the physical world. For them the elements, which are neither mental nor material, are bound together by either psychical laws or physical laws, a division which Bogdanov regarded as failing to account for the relationship between neurophysiological processes and sensations. For him the psychical and the physical differ in being different levels of organization of  experience.  The  psychical  is  individually  organized  experience within  the  limits  of  personal  life,  while  physical  experience  is  the  product  of social  organization.  The  objectivity  of  the  physical  does  not  have  a  basis  in epistemology  but  has  a  sociological  basis  as  the  product  and  reflection  of social-labor organization. To deny the social-conditionality of the objective is to be  \"non-dialectical,  non-historical  and  non-Marxist\". 28   Both  psychical  and\n\n25  This doctrine was first worked out in A.A. Bogdanov, Empiriomonizm: Stat'i po filosofii [ Empiriomonism: Articles on Philosophy ],  3  Volumes  (St.  Petersburg  1904-6).  However  the  doctrine  was  further  developed  and  more  succinctly stated in Filosofiia zhivogo opyta, [ Philosophy of Living Experience ( PLE )]  (St  Petersburgh, 1913). This work has been thoroughly analysed by Jensen, op.cit.\n\n26  This is how Zenovia Sochor characterized Bogdanov's monism in \"A.A. Bogdanov: In Search of Cultural Liberation,\" op.cit. 1986, p.302 n.29, citing Bogdanov, Novyi Mir (Moscow, 1905), p.32.\n\n27   Bogdanov's  understanding  of  experience,  both  physical  and  psychical,  is  carefully  analysed  by  K.M.  Jensen. Jensen  shows  how  Bogdanov  has  generally  been  misunderstood  on  this  crucial  point.  (Jensen  op.cit.,  Chapter  IV \"Empiriomonism\", esp. pages 126 &amp; 128.\n\n28 PLE op.cit. p.287 (cited  by Jensen, ibid. p.130).\n\nphysical  knowledge  are  the  products  of  long  historical  developments,  the gradual, but inexorable expansion of social experience which has produced the growing complexity, depth and precision of humanity's organization of experience.\n\nIn  defending  this  social  theory  of  knowledge  Bogdanov  disagreed  with  the empirio-critics  over  the  importance  of  explanation.  As  Bogdanov  interpreted them,  the  empirio-critics  were  opposed  to  the  \"substitution\"  of  metaphysical constructs for experience; for instance atoms for observed phenomena such as heat  flows  or  correlations  between  temperature,  pressure  and  volume.  The empirio-critics  wanted  to  free  science  from  such  substitutions  and  reduce knowledge  to  pure  description  of  experience,  which  could  be  expressed  in functional relationships between variables. For Bogdanov, description is a slave to experience; knowledge is the organization of experience, to form and fulfil it. While he was sympathetic to attacks on substitutions which had come to be taken  as  absolutes,  he  argued  that  all  advances  in  knowledge  are  based  on substitution -knowledge is organized by cognitive models through substitution. Substitution begins with language. For instance the word \"anger\" is a substitute for certain gestures and facial expressions. Through substitution people can understand one another and can explain the sense of their actions. From this elemental level, substitution has been carried over to all  other  levels  of  experience  to  understand,  predict  and  explain,  and  to facilitate the control of nature. The process of substitution involves taking an object and effectively changing it into something else, while at the same time admitting the essential difference. For instance to say that the sun is a star, a conglomeration  of  gases  in  space  which  behaves  according  to  the  laws  of motion, is to substitute something for the sun as it is visually apprehended by people.  One  complex  of  elements  of  experience  is  replaced  by  another. Substitution is employed at all levels of thought, including philosophical and scientific  explanation.  In  general,  advances  in  understanding  are  made  by substituting for a simpler, less plastic complex with which relatively little may be  done  in  practice  or  consciousness,  a  complex  which is  more subtle, more plastic  and  therefore  more  useful.  Hence  the tendency towards mathematical models in science. Substitution is the basic method for bringing all experience into a unified whole. What is required is not the abolition of substitution but a readiness  to  substitute  indefinitely,  and  a  recognition  of  the  practical  and conscious activity involved in such organization of experience. Bogdanov called for infinite substitution.\n\nIt is this theory of substitution which provides the foundation for Bogdanov's sociology of knowledge. One  of the problems raised by the theory of substitution is where do the \"substitutes\" come from. Bogdanov elaborated a new form of  the  dialectic  to  account  for  this  -  a  dialectic  of  social  labor.  He argued that workers who initially develop their separate perspectives through labor, come into conflict, which is intensified by the urge to complete a task. The conflict is resolved when one workers' perspective prevails over the other, or  some  third  perspective  is  generated  which  is  agreed  upon.  This  scheme, \"created  in  one  realm  of  social  experience,  may  then  be  applied  beyond  its limits  to  other  realm  of  phenomena,  social  and  extra-social.\"  This  Bogdanov characterized  as  the  law  of  \"sociomorphism\". 29   Cognitive  models  which  are used  as  substitutes  may  originate  in  simple  social-labor  practice,  in  the methods  of  social-labor  technique,  or  in  economic  relations.  Cognitive  forms taken  from  the  real  world  in  this  way,  then  reinforce  the  way  this  world  is\n\n29  Ibid. p.218, cited by Jensen, ibid. p.93. PLE p.291f.\n\norganized.  Particular  substitutes  are  taken  as  absolute,  are  fetishised  and treated as idols, just as the institution of property is fetishised and idolized in capitalist society. For instance, Bogdanov argued that:\n\n...  the  savage  living  in  a  commune  which  is  organized  on  the  basis  of authoritarian leadership and passive submission, thinks, that is, organizes in his consciousness, of the entire universe in the same way: he thinks of the  ruling  \"god\"  and  the  people  and  things  subordinated  to  him;  and  he organizes them in his thought into the ruling, leading \"soul\" and the passive \"body\". 30\n\nConceiving  of  the  universe  in  the  same  way,  fetishizing  the  authoritarian relationship which is being used as a substitute, legitimates such authoritarian leadership and makes it difficult to even conceive the possibility of organizing society  in  a  different  way.  Extending  this  theory  of  substitution  Bogdanov argued  that atomism  \"originated in  ancient  thought  when individualism developed in society setting men apart. People were accustomed to think about themselves and others as isolated entities, and they transferred this habit onto notions about nature: in Greek, 'atom' means an 'individual,' and in Latin it means 'indivisibility.'\" 31  Atomism is then fetishised and used to legitimate such individualism.  In Philosophy  of  Living  Experience ,  Bogdanov  used  this  way  of analysing  the  source  of  cognitive  models  to  explain  the  history  of  materialist philosophy from the pre-Socratics to the materialists of the nineteenth century. He  also  explained  the  ideas  of  the  empirio-critics,  whom  he  noted  were socialists, as the product of a new class within capitalist society between the bourgeoisie  and  the  proletariat  which  had  partially  overcome  the  division between intellectual and manual labor, and by virtue of this had come to see the substitutions of past science as fetishes, just as they had come to recognize that property is a fetish. 32\n\nThe  criticism  of  empirio-critics  for  failing  to  recognize  the  importance  of explanation, leading to the development of the theory of \"substitution\", and the socio-historical analysis of the development of knowledge utilizing the notion of \"sociomorph\",  closely  parallels  the  views  of  knowledge  which  developed  in opposition to logical positivism in the West. \"Substitution\" corresponds to the central place given to analogies or to metaphors by Thomas Kuhn, Rom Harré and  Mary  Hesse,  while  the  theory  of  \"sociomorphs\"  anticipates  the  efforts  of Marxist historians of science such as Franz Borkenau, Edgar Zilsel and Robert Young  to  show  the  relationship  between  scientific theories and  society. However while post-positivist philosophers of science such as Mary Hesse and Marxist historians of science such as Robert Young have been at loggerheads over  whether  developments  in  science  should  be  understood  in  terms  of internal criteria or explained by external factors, Bogdanov combined these two perspectives. He did so by a number of stratagems.\n\nBogdanov rejected the claim that any knowledge is absolute, arguing for the relativity  of  ways  of  organizing  experience  to  historical  conditions.  While  the cosmology of the Middle Ages must now be rejected, it can still be recognized as the best way of organizing experience at that time. However Bogdanov was not a complete relativist. He characterized the superiority of modern knowledge by casting  in  terms  of  it  an  historical  narrative  defining  the  achievements  and limitations  of  past  theories.  As  Alasdair  MacIntyre  has  convincingly  argued, this is the way theories can be evaluated without recourse to absolute criteria\n\n30   A.  Bogdanov, Essays  in  Tektology:  The  General  Science  of  Organization [1921]  (Seaside,  Calif.:  Intersystems Publications, 2nd ed. 1984), p.29.\n\n31  Loc.cit.\n\n32  Jensen op.cit. pp.50-66, 81-86.\n\nstanding independent of all theories. 33  However Bogdanov did more than this. He  also  cast  into  an  historical  narrative  the  changing  social  conditions  of knowledge,  and  evaluated  these  also  by  their  achievements  and  limitations from  the  perspective  not  of  present  knowledge,  but  from  the  hypothetical perspective  of  knowledge  developed  in  a  society  of  the  future  which  would enable the fragmentation of present knowledge to be overcome. As Bogdanov wrote in his second utopian novel Engineer Menni ,  also  set  on  Mars after the creation of a communist society:\n\nThus  was  born  \"Universal  Science,\"  which  soon  embraced  the  entire organization  experience  of  mankind.  The  philosophy  of  former  times  was nothing but a vague presentiment of this science, while the laws governing nature,  social  life,  and  thought  that  had  been  discovered  by  the  different disciplines turned out to be individual manifestations of its principles. 34\n\nThis  theory  of  knowledge  has  dramatic  implications.  It  implies  that  the limitations  in  the  science  of  Bogdanov's  own  time  were  at  least  in  part  a manifestation of the limitations of the form of society scientists were living in, and  conversely,  that  the  existing  social  order  was  being  maintained  by  the fetishized  substitutions  of  such  defective  forms  of  knowledge.  Bogdanov  not only  interpreted  and  evaluated  the  knowledge  of  his  day  in  relation  to  past knowledge. Constructing his history of science involved projecting the direction science should take in the future; and he strove to lay the foundations for this new science. And since he saw science as indissociable from social conditions, he was able to project what social conditions would be needed to develop this new science - social conditions which he believed would also require this new science.  What  Bogdanov  called  for,  and  devoted  most  of  the  rest  of  his  life promoting  and  developing,  was  the  creation  of  a  new  way  of  organizing experience, a proletarian culture.\n\n## 6. Proletarian Culture and Tektology\n\nThe  need  to  create  a  new  proletarian  culture  had  been  a  concern  of Bogdanov's from 1904 onwards. 35 However after having completed the elaboration  of  his  empiriomonist  philosophy  and  having  broken  with  the Leninists,  Bogdanov  focussed  most  of  his  efforts  in  this  direction.  As  he understood it, the failure of the revolution of 1905 had shown that the workers were  not  yet  prepared  to  take  political  power,  and  that  even  if  they  gained political power, they were not culturally prepared to create a genuinely socialist society.  Unlike  Lenin  whose  major  concern  was  with  the  seizure  of  power, Bogdanov  was  more  concerned  with  the  longer  term  project  of  creating  a socialist society. 36  It followed from Bogdanov's social theories that it is not the property  relations  of  capitalism  which  are  the  most  important  means  of domination  in  society  but  the  way  production  is  organized.  And  since  social labor is based on the organization of experience, what is required to change the way production is organized is the creation and development of new ways of organizing experience, a struggle against the fetishisms and idols which have\n\n33  Alasdair MacIntyre, \"Epistemological Crises, Dramatic Narratives and the Philosophy of Science,\" Monist , 60, 1977, pp.453-472. Using Galileo as an example, MacIntyre pointed out that Galileo's theory \"for the first time, enables the work of all his predecessors to be evaluated by a common set of standards ... the history of medieval science can at last be cast into a coherent narrative.\" (p.459f.)\n\n34  Bogdanov, \"Engineer Menni\", op.cit., p.232.\n\n35  In 1925 Bogdanov collected and published a large number of articles on proletarian culture dating back to 1904 in an anthology, O proletarskoi kul'ture, 1904-1924 ( On Proletarian Culture ) (Leningrad and Moscow, 1925).\n\n36  On this see James C. McClelland, \"Utopianism versus Revolutionary Heroism in Bolshevik Policy: The Proletarian Culture Debate\", Slavic Review , 39, 3, September, 1980.\n\nprevented  people  appreciating  that  the  organization  of  production  and  social relations  could  be  different.  Socialism  cannot  be  achieved  by  \"a  revolution  of property, a change in rulers of society - a matter of class interests and material force  of  the  masses.\"  It  requires  \"a  creative  revolution  of  world  culture,  a change from spontaneous education and struggle of social forms to conscious creation - a matter of a new class logic, new methods of unifying forces, new methods of thinking.\" 37\n\nApart from property relations and the organization of production, all social relationships based on domination and subordination, whether these be based on  sex,  race,  class,  nationality  or  possession  of  technical  knowledge,  are sources of conflict which must be criticised and overcome by the proletariat. As Bogdanov put it: \"the struggle for socialism is not by any means to be equated with  an  exclusive  war  against  capitalism.\"  It  involves  \"the  creation  of  new elements of socialism in the proletariat itself, in its internal relations, and in its conditions of everyday life: the development of a socialist proletarian culture.\" 38 Bogdanov also paid attention to male-female relationships as problematic, as needing  to  be  transformed  by  the  proletariat. 39   Consequently,  a  genuine revolution is not something which could be achieved by one gigantic act of will in which power is seized, but a transformative process involving many levels. Only  when  the  proletariat  can  oppose  the  old  cultural  world  with  its  own political  force,  its  own  economic  plan  and  its  \"new  world  of  culture,  with  its new, higher methods\" will genuine socialism be possible. 40\n\nArt,  literature,  philosophy  and  science  were  all  accorded  importance  by Bogdanov as ideological labor, their object being a transformation of the way people  organize  their  experience  to  achieve  a  common  understanding  of  the world. In opposition to orthodox Marxists Bogdanov argued: \"Art ... is a most powerful weapon for the organization of collective forces and, in a class society, of  class  forces.\" 41   The  ultimate  goal  of  ideological  labor  is  overcoming  the divisions between people and the creation of a collective of creative individuals with  a  common  will  which  can  be  appreciated  as  such  by  each  individual member of this collective. This is associated with overcoming the alienation of people from each other and the affirmation by them of their collective power, their common will to create and to control nature for human ends. In the new society,  with  the  overcoming  of  class  and  other  divisions,  the  \"psychology  of disconnectedness\" will be replaced by the recognition of the self as \"an integral part of the great whole.\" 42  This is Bogdanov's answer to Sorel's reinterpretation of Marx to celebrate not the scientific analysis of society, but the provision of a \"myth\"  which  gave  the working  class something  to  live for,  and  more importantly, to the challenge of Nietzsche, who diagnosed the nihilism of the age  as  a  consequence  of  the  triumph  of  slave  morality,  as  the  will-to-power turned against itself, a triumph which would be only more complete if socialists were to prevail. 43  Bogdanov's was not a socialism of negation, of ressentiment , but a socialism which affirmed the human will.\n\n37  Bogdanov, \"Ideal i put',\" in Voprosy sotsializma (Moscow, 1918), p.100f.; cited Sochor, op.cit. p.39.\n\n38  Bogdanov, \"Sotsializm v sastoiashchem,\" Vpered , 2, February, 1911, p.68; cited in ibid. p.39.\n\n39  On this, see Loren R.

(Moscow, 1920)(cited by Sochor, op.cit., p.197).\n\n43  See Sochor, 1988 op.cit.\n\nAccording to Bogdanov, science would be the most important component of the new culture because it bridges the gap between ideological and technological knowledge. Recent developments in science, themselves manifestations  of  the  change  in  work  and  work  relations,  were  seen  to  be already portents of the new socialist society. In societies with an authoritarian structure, such  as ancient or feudal societies, cause  is understood  to predominate  over  effect  as  something  strong  and  active.  Regularities  in  the material world are seen as produced by spirit, by something transcending the world. With the development of capitalist society effect is understood abstractly as following cause out of some sort of natural or logical necessity, independent of human will and experience, reflecting the powerlessness of people before the impersonal imperatives of the market. With the development of more complex technology  bringing  a  closer  relationship  between  labor  and  the  control  of production, a new concept of causation has emerged within science. Machine production changes the world by turning the physical, chemical and electrical forces into one another as natural forces are turned into the mechanical forces of production. In essence, machine production is \"the systematic transformation of efforts, or, in scientific and exact terms, the transformation of 'energy'\". 44  Bogdanov rejected the \"fetishistic\" concept of energy as a thing in itself,  and  also  the  notion  of  it  being  a  useful  fiction;  the  first  because  it represents  energy  apart  from  labor  activity,  the  second  because  it  conceives energy only in relation to thought and not in relation to action. The concept of energy arises from the use of labor causality as a substitute, and it should be recognized as such. Energy represents the practical relationship of society to nature, of human activity to that which resists it. The transformation of energy refers to the creation and change wrought by active, human effort on resisting nature;  \"to  see  'energy'  in  the  processes  of  nature  means  to  look  at  those processes from the perspective of their possible labor exploitation by man.\" 45 Since neither effort nor energy is either created or destroyed in production, but simply takes on different appearances and uses, cause and effect modelled on the transformation of energy must appear as equal, as simply \"different phases in a continuous series of changing and changeable phenomena.\" 46\n\nThis  change  foreshadows  a  situation  where  workers  will  cease  to  be  mere laborers and will control production. Then, laboring will be recognized as the organization  of  the  series  of  changing  and  changeable  phenomena,  and laborers will appreciate work as such. As manual work becomes increasingly organizational  and  intellectual,  laborers  will  first  unite  with  the  technical intelligentsia, then become engineer-workers, and finally will become scientistworkers.  This  will  be  associated  with  the  overcoming  of  the  specialization  of society based on capitalist exchange relations. What is required to bring this about,  for  laborers  to  become  scientists  able  to  appreciate  all  aspects  of production,  and  simultaneously,  what  will  emerge  with  the  overcoming  of specialization  based  on  capitalist  exchange  relations,  is  a  new  science  which focuses on the general features of all organization and  which  thereby systematizes the entire cognitive experience of the past. Bogdanov believed that the greatest contribution he could make to creating a proletarian culture was founding such a science of organization, and devoted most of the rest of his life to this, producing what he regarded as his most important work, Tektology: The\n\n44  Bogdanov, PLE , op.cit. p.268f.(Jensen, op.cit. p.120).\n\n45  Ibid. p.271 (cited ibid. p.122).\n\n46  Ibid., p.270 (cited ibid. p.121).\n\nUniversal  Organizational  Science (from  the  Greek  word  \"tekton,\"  meaning \"builder\" - a term Bogdanov took from Haeckel's morphology). 47\n\nBogdanov  described Tektology in  his  autobiography  as  \"a  general  study  of the forms and laws of the organization of all elements of nature, practice and thought.\" 48  According to him, \"we are organizers of nature, of ourselves and of our experience,\" and he examined \"our practice, cognition and artistic creations from  this  organizational  point  of  view.\"  Moreover  Bogdanov  believed  that  our organizational experience could be used as a substitute for understanding the rest  of  nature,  and  argued  that  this  provides  the  basis  for  a  monistic  worldview, allowing us to see ourselves as self-organizing parts of a self-organizing nature. It is not only we who organize. Nature itself is the first great organizer, and humans are only one of its organized products. \"Inorganic\" nature is highly organized. \"Matter,\" Bogdanov argued, \"with all of its inertia, is being perceived as  the  most  concentrated  complex  of  energy,  that  is,  precisely  activities;  its atom is a system of closed motions, the speed of which exceeds all others in nature.\" 49   And  the  simplest  of  living  cells  \"surpasses  in  complexity  and perfection of its organization all that man can organize.\" 50  Bogdanov concluded:\n\nThus, the experience and ideas of contemporary science lead us to the only integral, the only monistic understanding of the universe. It appears before us  as  an  infinitely  unfolding  fabric  of  all  types  of  forms  and  levels  of organization, from the unknown elements of ether to human collectives and star systems. All these forms, in their interlacement and mutual struggle, in their constant changes, create the universal organizational process, infinitely split in its parts, but continuous and unbroken in its whole. 51\n\nThe basic focus of Tektology is on the necessity to study any phenomenon from the point of view of its organization, since all activities of humans and of the rest  of  nature  are  primarily  organization  and  disorganization  of  elements  on hand. The work attempts to systematize the fragmented knowledge of organizational methods so they can be studied and developed systematically to reveal  structural  relations  and  laws  common  to  the  most  heterogeneous phenomena, to reveal the most general characteristics of organization. Aspects of organization form considered are wholeness, self-regulation, transformation and development; equilibrium and disequilibrium; and stability, instability and crises.\n\n## 7. The Communist Revolution: Bogdanov and the Proletkult Movement\n\nIn 1916 Bogdanov had published four major articles analysing the dynamics of  the  war  economies  of  the  belligerent  powers,  developing  a  theory  of  \"War Communism\",  arguing  that  this  was  paving  the  way  for  the  emergence  of  a system  of  State  Capitalism  which  would  be  maintained  after  the  war. 52 Bogdanov speculated that this new system might not be presided over by the bourgeoisie,  but  might  come  under  the  management  of  a  new  class  \"of economists,  engineers,  doctors,  and  lawyers,  in  short,  of  the  intelligentsia\n\n47   A.A.

Essays in Tektology (op.cit.) is essentially a condensation of this three volume work.\n\n48  Haupt and Marie op.cit.p.288.\n\n49  Ibid. p.42.\n\n50  Bogdanov, Essays in Tektology , op.cit. p.5.\n\n51  Ibid. p.6.\n\n52   \"Mirovye  krizisy,  mirnye  i  voennye,\" Letopis' ,  2,4,5,7,  1916.  On  these  articles  see  John  Biggart,  \"Alexander Bogdanov and the Theory of a 'New Class'\", The Russian Review, 49, 1990, pp.265-82, p.270f.\n\nitself.\" 53   Extending  these  analyses  to  Russia  some  years  later  Bogdanov characterized the socioeconomic system which developed in Russia during the Revolution  and  Civil  War  as  \"War  Communism  of  the  Laboring  Classes\".  He denied  that  this  was  genuine  communism,  and  argued  that  like  the  Military State Capitalism which had developed in the war years in the West, this was economically  destructive  and  had  to  be  abandoned.  This  explained  the  New Economic Policy implemented from March, 1921, which was largely a return to a  market  based  economy. Bogdanov did not attempt to characterize the New Economic Policy, but did put forward the thesis that the revolution in Russia might  yet  result  in  the  subjugation  of  the  proletariat  by  some  new  social stratum  of  technical  intelligentsia,  and  he  warned  that  if  Gastev's  proposals (supported by Lenin) for the scientific organization of labor along Taylorist lines were implemented, this would result in the emergence of a new ruling class of scientific engineers.\n\nBogdanov was actively engaged in opposing such tendencies. Lunacharskii, Bogdanov's brother-in-law and fellow Vperedist had returned to Russia in May 1917, and had rejoined the Bolsheviks. 54  Strongly influenced by Bogdanov and also committed to the creation of a proletarian culture, Lunacharskii organized the first conference of proletarian cultural-educational organizations (Proletkult) in Petrograd just before the October Revolution. After the revolution Lunacharskii was made Commissar of Enlightenment. His first declaration as Commissar was:\n\nThe people themselves, consciously or unconsciously, must evolve their own culture  ...  The  independent  action  of  ...  workers',  soldiers',  and  peasants' cultural-education organizations must  achieve  full  autonomy,  both  in relation to the central government and to the municipal centres. 55\n\nIn February of 1918 Bogdanov organized a conference in Moscow to establish a Moscow Proletkult, and on 25 September 1918 the first All-Russian Conference of proletarian cultural-educational organizations met in Moscow, and Proletkult was  established  as  a  laboratory  of  proletarian  ideology  and  as  a  mass educational organization. At this conference Bogdanov called for the establishment of a workers' university and a workers' encyclopaedia, and called for  the  socialization  of  science,  calls  which  led  to  the  establishment  of  the Proletarian University (with 400 students) in Moscow in 1919.\n\nProletkult had a stormy, turbulent, brilliant and short career, promoting the creativity  of  the  working  class  in  literature,  theatre,  music  and  science,  and providing  a  haven  for  those  opposed  to  the  authoritarian  and  capitalistic tendencies in the Soviet government. 56  While supported by Lunacharskii in his capacity  as  Commissar  of  Enlightenment,  it  was  Bogdanov  who  rose  to  be Prolekult's  leading  light,  and  his  science  of  organization  was  disseminated  to half  a  million  workmen outside the studios. Associated with his work in this movement  Bogdanov  wrote Art  and  the  Working  Class (1918), Socialism  and Science (1918) and The Elements of Proletarian Culture in the Development of the Working Class (1920). In these writings and in his debates with other Proletkult members Bogdanov upbraided those who strove to reduce workers to a mass or herd, or those who merely attacked the ideas of the bourgeoisie, and he railed against proletarian art based on \"personal hatred, gloating insults, lynch law, even  sadistic delight in the theme  of  pulling  out  the  intestines  of the\n\n53  Vseobshchaia Organizatsionnaia Nauka (Tektologiia), vol.2 (Moscow, 1917), p.140 (cited ibid. p.271).\n\n54  On Bogdanov's response to this see his letter to Lunacharskii (November 19, 1917) in Gloveli, op.cit. pp.45-50.\n\n55  Quoted by Fitzpatrick, p.89.\n\n56  On Proletkult see Mally, op.cit .\n\nbourgeoisie.\" For instance he repudiated the symbols of V. Kirillov's poem, \"We\" ( My ),  \"In  the  name  of  our  Tomorrow,  /  let  us  burn  Raphael,  /  destroy museums, / trample on the flowers of art\", for being suffused with \"the spirit of the  soldier  not  the  worker.\" 57   The  worker  should  not  be  motivated  by  petty malice  against  the  individual  representatives  of  capitalism  since  such  people are  the  inevitable  products  of  their  social  environment.  What  is  required  is unyielding enmity towards capitalism, and a commitment to the nobler end of creating  \"a  new  aristocracy  of  culture\",  a  culture  \"combining  the  work  of  the head with that of the hands.\" 58  To those who were sceptical of the ability of the proletariat  to  create  such  a  culture,  Bogdanov  retorted,  \"And  if  [proletarian culture] were beyond one's strength, the working class would have nothing to count on, except the transition from one enslavement to another, [that is,] from under the yoke of capitalists to the yoke of engineers and the educated.\" 59\n\nLenin had been alarmed at the influence of Prolekult in 1919, and in 1920 made  a  determined  effort  to  have  it  subordinated  to  the  Commissariat  of Enlightenment.  In  response  to  this,  Bogdanov  resigned  from  its  leading councils. Lenin continued to oppose the influence of Proletkult and to curtail its  activities,  and  in  January,  1922,  Prolekult  lost  its  subsidy  from  the Commissariat  of  Enlightenment.  Subsequently  Proletkult  withered  away  and Bogdanov lost the platform to disseminate his ideas to the workers, although he  remained  a  member  of  the  Socialist  Academy  of  Social  Science  and continued to publish his views in the journal of the Academy and in books.\n\nWhile Bogdanov refrained from analysing the relationship between Proletkult and the Bolshevik government in class terms, Bogdanov's supporters spelt out the  implications  of  his  ideas.  The  \"Collectivists\",  former  members  of  the Workers' Opposition, inspired by Bogdanov's organizational theory and proclaiming  themselves  \"Marxists  of  that  school  whose  intellectual  leader  is Bogdanov\", distributed a manifesto in November, 1921 during the Second AllRussian Congress of the Proletkults which condemned Lenin and characterized the October Revolution as the introduction into Russia of a world-wide system of  State  Capitalism. 60   They  argued  that  the  intelligentsia  were  emerging  as  a new, independent class. Lenin on reading this manifesto labelled it a \"Platform of  Bogdanovites\". 61   The  Collectivists  seemed  to  vanish,  but  appear  to  have merged  their  activities  with  a  kindred  group, Rabochaya  Pravda (Workers' Truth), who also drew their inspiration from Bogdanov. In its journal this group characterized  the  post-revolutionary  order  as  a  continuation  of  the  \"militarystate capitalism\" of pre-war years, and argued that the technical intelligentsia had united with the more competent members of the old bourgeoisie to form a new  bourgeoisie  of  responsible  functionaries,  plant  directors,  managers  of trusts and chairmen of the Soviet committees antagonistic to the interests of the working class. The Communist Party had degenerated, turning into a ruling party  of  the  organizers  and  managers  of  the  governmental  apparatus  and economic  life and  opportunistic  elements  from  the  upper  strata  of the proletariat.\n\nThe activities of this group had unfortunate consequences for Bogdanov. In 1923 Rabochaya  Pravda organized  strikes  in  industry.  Suspected  members\n\n57  Bogdanov, O proletarskoi kul'ture op.cit., p.163 and 173; cited Sochor, Revolution and Culture , p.95.\n\n58   Bogdanov, Elemny proletarskoi kul'tury  v  razivitii  rabochega  klassa (Moscow, 1920). p.40 (cited in Sochor, 1988, op.cit., p.132).\n\n59  A.A.

He  was  released  a  month  later  after  having convinced Felix Dzerzhinskii, the head of OGPU, that while he shared some of the  positions  of Rabochaya  Pravda ,  he  had  no  formal  association  with  it. 62 Following this incident Bogdanov increasingly withdrew from political activity and  devoted  himself  to  scientific  work.  When  Bogdanov  died  exchanging  his blood with a seriously ill patient, many saw this as suicide in response to his pessimism about the future of Russia in the face of the increasing authoritarianism of Stalin's government.\n\n## 8. Bogdanov's Importance for the Environmental Movement\n\nAs  I  have  already  pointed  out,  Bogdanov  addressed  the  issue  of  the environmental constraints on economic development in his utopian novel Red Star .  Describing the situation confronting Martians who were conceived to be far in advance of people on Earth both in terms of their social development and in terms of their problems, Bogdanov, it is argued, showed great prescience to anticipate the problems we would face in the future even if communism were achieved.\n\nRed  Star is  the  story  of  Leonid,  a  communist  revolutionary  who  after  the attempted revolution of 1905 is taken to Mars. There he is at first impressed by the harmony and fullness of life brought about by the communist revolution. However it soon appears that this harmony is superficial, that Mars is suffering from  the  effects  of  its  successes.  Industries  have  become  so  dangerously polluting that many have to be kept underground. The population is growing so rapidly  that  food  shortages  and  even  famines  are  predicted  within  several decades.  Natural  resources,  including  radioactive  matter  which  is  the  main source of energy, are rapidly being exhausted. A Martian describes the frequent disastrous  side-effects  of  trying  to  overcome  these  shortages. 63   For  instance deforestation  resulting  from  an  effort  to  overcome  an  energy  shortage  had worsened  the  climate  on  Mars  for  decades.  Most  importantly,  socialist  Mars has  created  a  Colonial  Group  in  its  government  and  is  preparing  to  create colonies on Earth or Venus, or both, to replenish Mars' resources. It transpires that  the  Martians  are  considering  eradicating  human  life  [by  painless  death rays] to enable them to exploit the Earth's resources. In the arguments between the  Martians  over  this  strategy  Bogdanov  anticipated  the  arguments  which have now become prominent between the \"shallow ecologists\", who argue that people in economically advanced societies are the ultimate end and should be prepared to destroy other life forms in the cause of human progress, and the \"deep  ecologists\"  who  argue  that  all  life  is  significant.  One  Martian,  Sterni, takes  the  position  that  Earthlings  are  so  hopelessly  malformed  by  their evolutionary past that even the Earth's socialist minority would never be able to  work  together  amicably  with  their  fellow  socialists  on  Mars.  To  prevent  a long  guerrilla  war  of  resistance,  Sterni  argues  that  the  Earthlings  should  be wiped out in advance, painlessly, with death rays so that the riches of Earth can be used to build a more humane socialism on Mars. He argues: \"There is but one life in the Universe, and it will be enriched rather than impoverished if it is our socialism rather than the distant, semibarbaric Earthly variant that is allowed to develop.\" Netti replies: \"'There is but one Life in the Universe,' says Sterni.  And  yet  what  does  he  propose  to  us?  That  we  exterminate  an  entire individual type of life, a type which we can never resurrect or replace.... [T]he\n\n62  Biggart, op.cit. p.280.\n\n63  Bogdanov, Red Star , op.cit. p.79.\n\nEarthlings are not the same as we. They and their civilization are not simply lower and weaker than ours - they are different .  If  we  eliminate them we will not  replace  them  in  the  process  of  universal  evolution  but  will  merely  fill  in mechanically the vacuum we have created in the world of life forms.\" 64\n\nHowever what is most important about Bogdanov is that this prescience, this celebration of the diversity of life forms, was based on a world-view which was elaborated  coherently  and  effectively  defended.  It  follows  from  the  place Bogdanov accorded the concept of energy in this world-view that it is necessary to  acknowledge  limitations  to  economic  growth,  and  it  follows  from  his commitment to monism and the centrality of the notion of organization that the interdependencies  between  organisms  in  nature  and  the  constraints  these impose on economic life should be recognized, and that non-European forms of human life and non-human life should be appreciated as unique organizational forms  along  with  those  of  the  most  socially  and  technologically  advanced humans.  Even  if  Bogdanov  had  not  drawn  out  these  implications,  the importance  of  his  world-view  for  environmentalists  would  still  have  to  be recognized.  For  this  reason  it  is  not  significant  that  Bogdanov  frequently celebrated the ultimate goal of labor as the total domination of nature, since this project is inconsistent with his world-view and merely shows that he had not  yet  fully  extricated  himself  from  the  dualism  of  bourgeois  society,  the overcoming of which he was both predicting and helping to bring about, in both practice and theory. 65\n\nWhat is germane to us is that Bogdanov and those influenced by him, most importantly,  Lunacharskii,  had  created  an  intellectual  milieu  within  which those concerned about the environmental could flourish as never before. After the  demise  of  Proletkult  the  Commissariat  of  Enlightenment,  headed  by Lunacharskii, continued to develop an education system devoted to providing equal  access  for  all,  to  developing  the  child's  individuality  and  creativity.  It broadened the curriculum to include the study of the surrounding environment, both physical and aesthetic education, and training in elementary labor and craft skills. And it continued to support creative work in science and the arts with a minimum of outside interference and pressure as the condition for creating a new culture. Lunacharskii persevered in trying to cultivate a population of people able to control their own destinies, to creating a new form of society. This was a milieu in which art, music, literature, theatre, film-making,  literary  and  cultural  theory,  economics,  legal  theory,  sociology, psychology  and  the  natural  sciences,  all  flowered.  It  was  a  milieu  in  which Soviet ecologists came to lead the world in their research and to spearhead a radical  and  powerful  conservation  movement  resolved  to  harmonizing  the economic life of society with the energetic processes and  spontaneous organization of nature. 66\n\nWhile  Bogdanov's  tektology  set  the  agenda,  his  influence  was  indirect.  A more  direct  inspiration  for  the  ecologists  was  Vladimir  Ivanovich  Vernadskii. However Vernadskii's concept of the biosphere, his concern with the interdependence  of  all  processes  in  nature  and  his  embracing  of  energetics, accorded with Bodganov's cosmology, and while he was unable to pursue his career in the West, he was given a new professorial position within the Russian Academy  of  Science. The  most  original of the ecologists influenced by\n\n64  Bogdanov, Red Star , p.116f.\n\n65  Mark Adams' claim that Bogdanov should not be considered an environmentalist because he did not generalize his analysis of Mars to Earth, is irrelevant. (\"'Red Star' Another Look at Aleksandr Bogdanov\", Slavic Review, 48, 1, 1989, pp.1-15).\n\n66  Weiner 1988, op.cit.\n\nVernadskii  was  Vladimir  Vladimirovich  Stanchinskii,  who  later  became  the main spokesperson for the conservation movement. 67 Like Vernadskii, Stanchinskii's  ideas  accorded  with  Bogdanov's  tektology,  and  his  career  was made possible by the new Bolshevik education system. Stanchinskii was the first  person to trace the energy flows through ecosystems and to identify and give a mathematical formula for the energy transfers between \"trophic levels\". Biological communities were seen as having a distinctive structure characterized by interdependence among their biotic components and being in a  state  of  relative  equilibrium,  or  \"proportionality.\"  On  the  basis  of  this ecological  theory  Stanchinskii  led  the  ecologists  in  arguing  that  if  civilization continues  to  disrupt  the  balance  of  natural  communities  it  will  eventually destroy  itself,  and  he  was  supported  in  this  claim  by  Lunacharskii. 68   The ecologists then called for a central role for ecology in formulating the Five Year Plans.\n\nThe creation of the milieu within which these ideas developed was part of the Vperedist project of breaking down class barriers, breaking down the division between intellectual and manual labor, of uniting scientists and other creative thinkers with the working class already begun under capitalism. According to Bogdanov, it was the movement of society in this direction which would make energy the primary concept within the sciences, and which would then bring the concept of organization, both in social life and in nature, into central focus. The  ideas  developed  by  Vernadskii  and  the  ecologists  confirmed  Bogdanov's theory  of  sociomorphs  and  his  vision  of  the  way  science  would  develop  in  a classless society free from domination  by exchange  relations. But also confirming Bogdanov's theory, and vindicating his concern about the authoritarian  tendencies  of  the  Bolshevik  government,  was  the  fate  of  the ecologists and their environmental concerns as the quest for a classless society faltered. The failure of Bogdanov's Proletkult paved the way for the crystallization  and  consolidation  of  the  new  class  of  technical  intelligentsia, many of whom had risen from the working class, who set themselves above the mass of the workers and the peasantry. 69  The rise of Stalin can be understood as  part  of  the  development  of  this  new  class.  The  rise  of  this  class  was associated  first  with  efforts  to  impose  a  party  line  on  scientific  work,  and culminated  in  the  reduction  of  science  to  nothing  but  an  instrument  of economic (and military) development. This Stalinization of science engendered a new dualism between consciousness as the center of action, identified with the  Communist  Party,  and  the  rest  of  the  world  which  was  conceived  to  be material, \"the entire world existing independent of us.\" 70  With this dualism the new  ruling class was  blinded to the dependence  of  humanity  as  one organizational form in nature on other organizational forms, which corresponded to the blindness of this class to the complexities and significance of  the  organizational  forms  of  the  peasantry  and  minority  groups  within  the\n\n67  On these ecologists see Weiner, 1988, op.cit.; Douglas Weiner, \"The Historical Origins of Soviet Environmentalism,\" Environmental Review , 6, 2, 1982 and \"Community Ecology in Stalin's Russia: 'Socialist' and 'Bourgeois' Science,\" Isis ,\n\n75, 1984.\n\n68  Weiner, 1988, op.cit. p.230.\n\n69  This development has been described by Kendall Bailes, Technology and Society Under Lenin and Stalin: Origins of the  Soviet  Technical  Intelligentsia,  1917-1941 (Princeton:  Princeton  University  Press,  1978).

In  this  article  Lobkowicz  examines  the  dualism  of  Soviet  dialectical materialism in some depth (pp.176-188).\n\nSoviet Union. With the emergence of this new class and its dualistic world-view ecologists were attacked \"for their 'traitorous' opposition to the heroic projects of the Five-Year Plans\" 71 and marginalized, many of them, including Stanchinskii, losing their academic positions. Subsequently the environmental movement contracted to a small holding operation.\n\nWhat  these  different  and  opposing  developments  showed  with  dramatic clarity was that it is through the dissolution of the class divisions of capitalist society,  through  the  rise  of  people  who  neither  dominate  nor  are  dominated, that it becomes possible to thoroughly develop and sustain the cognitive forms necessary  for  societies  to  properly  comprehend  that  humans  themselves  are organizational forms within nature, dependent on the autonomous dynamics of other  organizational  forms,  and  to  face  up  to  the  limits  to  the  sustainable exploitation of these forms.\n\n## 9. Conclusion\n\nBogdanov's significance lies in identifying the ultimate cause of the \"ways of organizing experience\" which have impaired our relationship to nature in the class divisions of society, in the division between intellectual and manual labor and in the division between those who organize and those who are organized. He  elaborated  a  philosophy  of  living  experience  and  a  general  theory  of organization which together reveal the need for and provide the foundation for, a new culture, including a new science. He accepted that the full development of his own ideas would only be possible as part of the creation of a classless society;  but  he  also  pointed  out  that  the  development  of  these  ideas,  the creation  of  a  proletarian  culture,  is  a  necessary  part  of  creating  a  classless society.  After  the  revolution  Bogdanov  and  those  influenced  by  him,  strove mightily to provide the proletariat and others with the conditions for creating this  new  culture  in  order  to  make  a  classless  society  in  the  Soviet  Union possible.  This  facilitated,  among  other  cultural  achievements,  the  rise  of  the ecologists  elaborating  radically  new  ways  of  organizing  experience  which accorded with Bogdanov's tektology. Bogdanov also identified and analysed the tendencies at work in the Communist Party, in the organization of the economy and in Russian culture which could re-establish class divisions. In so doing he identified the developments which would undermine the new, environmentally conscious ways of organizing experience which had been fostered.\n\nBogdanov's achievements extend beyond mere historical interest. His project of developing a concept of experience based on praxis, and to showing that all abstract  thinking  develops  through  such  experience,  has  been  furthered  by Maurice  Merleau-Ponty  and  his  followers.  But  while  these  thinkers  have defended  and  developed  this  project,  there  are  insights  in  Bogdanov's  work which have not been duplicated. While systems theorists such as Ludwig von Bertalanffy,  physicists  such  as  David  Bohm  and  chemists  such  as  Ilya Prigogine  have  furthered  our  understanding  of  energy  and  the  nature  of organization  (or  order),  there  are  dimensions  to  Bogdanov's  tektology  which illuminate features of the world ignored by later thinkers. While the tradition of cultural  ecology  which  was  partly  inspired  by  Bogdanov,  from  Leslie  White's anthropology  through  Robert  Newbold  Adams'  extension  of  this  to  study  the energetics of modern  industrial societies, to Stephen Bunker's brilliant reformulation of Marxist dependency theories to take into account energy flows through  the  world  system,  have  vastly  deepened  our  understanding  of  the relationship between cultural processes, social labor and the natural\n\n71  Weiner, 1984, op.cit. p.692.\n\nenvironment,  Bogdanov's  reformulation  of  Marx's  social  theories  can  still provide  guidance  for  research  in  this  area.  Bogdanov's  sociology  of  culture could  provide  insights  into,  and  a  basis  for  the  critique  of,  the  present Stalinization  of  science  and  trivialization  of  art  and  literature  in  Anglophone nations.  But  what  is  more  important  than  all  the  particular  aspects  of Bogdanov's  work  is  that  all  these  different  areas  of  research  are  given  due weight  and  brought  into  relationship  with  each  other,  and  related  to  the struggle  to  overcome  the  alienation  of  people  and  the  oppression  of  existing societies,  and  to  creating  a  new  socio-economic  order,  a  collective  of  creative individuals with a common  will  controlling their  own  destiny.  Through Bogdanov's  work,  achievements  and  influence,  we  now  know  why  it  is necessary  to  create  a  classless  society  to  fully  comprehend  and  to  live  in accordance  with  the  dynamics  of  nature,  and  that  creating  this  society  will involve a long struggle to develop new forms of social relationships, new forms of  art  and  literature,  and  a  new  science.  It  will  be  necessary  to  create  a  new culture.",
