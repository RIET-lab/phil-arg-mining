Anaxagoras's philosophy permits Pico to establish his doctrine that all things share a portion of God within them, in their own way. Pico rejects the fixed position of man in the ontological hierarchy. Man has the chance to become everything. Pico asserts that man contains all things in himself as their center, just like God contains all things as their origin. As a consequence, Anaxagoras's principle is supportive to Pico's metaphysics. Furthermore, Anaxagoras's metaphysical principle is supportive of Pico's method of allegorical interpretation, which is indispensable for his syncretism and his attempt to reveal hidden truths in every text or level of reality.\n\nKeywords: Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, Anaxagoras, Plotinus, Proclus, Neoplatonism, Intellect, Demiurge, homoiomereia, metaphysics, cum in ipsa ita sunt omnia, ut in ipsa omnia sint ipsa .\n\nGiovanni Pico della Mirandola (1463-1494) is well known for his attempt to enrich his  sources  by  resorting  to  philosophical  traditions  that  were  not  well  known  to fifteenth-century humanists so as to broaden his scope. 1 In the first half of the fifteenth century, Diogenes  Laertius's Vitae  Philosophorum was  translated in Latin by Ambrogio  Traversari. 2 Earlier  partial  Latin  translations  of  the  work  were  probably produced during the Middle Ages by Henricus Aristippus in the twelfth century. At least one medieval version of Diogenes Laertius's Vitae Philosophorum was available to  Walter  Burley  (1275-1344/5),  the  Prehumanists  in  Verona,  and  Petrarch's  friend Dionigi da Borgo S. Sepolcro (d. 1342), as several sources attested. 3 Diogenes Laer-\n\n* Department of Philosophy, School of Philosophy, University of Athens, 15703, Zografos, Athens.

T.\n\ntius's  work  became  an  additional  source  on  Presocratic  philosophy  in  the  fifteenth century and contributed to the revival of the interest in the field. In addition, Renaissance scholars derived indirect information about the Presocratics from the works of Aristotle  and  other  ancient  Greek  philosophers,  especially  the  Neoplatonists,  who commented on the Presocratic philosophy. Pico della Mirandola writes that, without any kind of obligation, he decided to study all the teachers and schools of philosophy. 4 Eclecticism is the bedrock of his philosophy. In addition to ancient Greek philosophy, his  research  also  includes  the  Presocratic  philosophy.  Pico  was  contentious  and  he seemed to enjoy philosophical disputes, despite the different readings of his works. As a  result,  in  his  effort  to  engage  in  heated  philosophical  debates  and  promote  human understanding, he is not afraid to challenge the established ideas and criticize even key theological doctrines. 5 This article seeks to explore the ways in which Giovanni Pico della Mirandola treated the philosophy of Anaxagoras (ca. 500-428 BC), the philosopher who transmitted the Ionian tradition to Athens, so as to formulate his own philosophy. Pico focuses on Anaxagoras because he considers him as a precursor of the the later  Neoplatonic  concept omnia  sunt  in  omnibus  modo  suo (all  things  exist  in  all things in their own mode) , which became the core of Pico's metaphysics. I will also attempt  to  identify  Pico's  sources  and  correct  common  misinterpretations  of  Pico's text in prior scholarship.\n\nIn his Conclusiones, Pico comments on Anaxagoras:\n\n- 3&gt;21. Per predictas conclusiones intelligi potest, que sit omiomeria Anaxagorae, quam opifex  intellectus  distinguit. 6 (Through  the  preceding  conclusions  one  can  understand  what Anaxagoras's homoeomeria is, which the demiurge of the intellect distinguishes.) 7\n- 3&gt;22. Nemo miretur quod Anaxagoras intellectum appellauerit immixtum, cum sit maxime mixtus, quia maxima mixtio coincidit cum maxima simplicitate in natura intellectuali. 8 (Let no one marvel that Anaxagoras  called the intellect unmixed, although it is  greatly  mixed, since the greatest mixture coincides with the greatest simplicity in the intellectual nature.) 9\n\nMuckle, 'Greek Works Translated Directly into Latin Before 1350,' 2nd Part, Medieval Studies 5 (1943) 110; T.

A. Farmer inaccurately suggests in his edition  of  Pico's Conclusiones 18 -seems  very  interesting  to  Pico  and  becomes  the core of his philosophy: omnia sunt in omnibus modo suo. 19 The Neoplatonic concepts, especially that the whole is in the part and that all things are in all, are of crucial importance for Pico's philosophy. 20 According to Pico, there are four worlds: the ultra mundane, which corresponds to the intelligible realm of the Platonists or the angelic realm of the theologians; the celestial; the sublunary; and the human.

Pico, as his phrasing suggests, was not persuaded that the ancient, medieval  commentators  and  he  personally  understood  and  interpreted  properly  the philosophy of Anaxagoras. Garin suggests that Pico draws on Simplicius, who is his main  source  for  Anaxagoras. 30 Although  Garin  argues  that  Pico  relies  on  a  certain passage, in which Simplicius exposes Anaxagoras's fundamental doctrines, 31 there is also  another,  at  least,  passage  from  which  Pico  would  have  drawn. 32 Furthermore, Pico owned and had access to Aristotle's Physics ,  various  copies  of  Simplicius's In Aristotelis  physicorum  libros  commentaria , and the eleventh-century  Byzantine polymath Michael Psellus's In Aristotelis physicorum libros commentarium . 33 Pico's reference to Pythagoreans and Platonists, in the plural, indicates that, besides Syrianus\n\n- 21 G.

Pico  argues,  according to Farmer's translation, that there is a Demiurge of the Intellect, who distinguishes  homoiomereia . In  addition  Pico  contends that  the  Intellect  is  greatly  mixed, because the greatest mixture coincides with the greatest simplicity in the intellectual nature. 37 On the contrary Anaxagoras is adamant: the Intellect is separate, unaffected, and unmixed. It does not contain a portion of everything, because otherwise it could not set things to move. If it mixes with one, it will mix with all. According to Anaxagoras everything which separates itself contains all things, besides the Intellect. 38 It is worth noting that Pico seems to follow Averroes and the Averroists on the Intellect, maintaining the unicity of the Intellect, despite the fact that he seems to endorse in a rather perplexed manner the personal immortality of the soul. 39\n\n- 34 Michael Psellus, 'In Aristotelis physicorum libros commentarium,' Michael Psellos Kommentar zur Physik des Aristoteles, Corpus Philosophorum Medii Aevi, Commentaria in Aristotelem Byzantina , ed.

The similarity of the two passages is obvious:\n\nPer predictas conclusiones intelligi potest, que sit omiomeria Anaxagorae, quam opifex intellectus distinguit. 49 (Through the preceding conclusions one can understand what Anaxagoras's homoeomeria is, which the demiurge of the intellect distinguishes.) 50\n\nκαὶ ὁ νοῦς δὲ παρὰ Ἀναξαγόρᾳ διακοσμῶν καὶ κινῶν ἐξ ἀρχῆς τὰς ὁμοιομερείας διακρίνειν αὐτάς λέγεται. 51 (And in Anaxagoras, Mind, which arranges and moves the homoeomeries from the beginning, is said 'to separate' them.) 52\n\n- 40 Plato, 'Phaedo,' Platonis opera , vol. 1, ed.

Homoiomereia, in the singular, is mentioned in DK 59 A45a. 54 In this passage is obvious that homoiomereia does not refer to the original mixture or to something similar to the meaning that Pico gives to the word.\n\nAristotle, the ancient expert  on  Presocratics,  cites  the  plurals  homoiomere ( ὁμοιομερή )  and homoiomereiai ( ὁμοιομέρειαι ).  Aristotle  uses the  word homoiomere consistently. 55 But  subsequent  authors  and  commentators,  including  several  Middle Platonists and Neoplatonists, are not so careful in their writings leading to misinterpretations and chancy readings.  Simplicius, who was familiar enough with Anaxagoras's philosophy, embraces the Aristotelian interpretation of homoiomere (ὁμοιομερή ), while he equates homoiomereiai ( ὁμοιομέρειαι ) with seeds ( σπέρματα ). 56 Anaxagoras refers to seeds, which are present in the original mixture and contain, as the original mixture, at the same time the opposites and the natural essences. 57 Previous scholarship  has  demonstrated  that  Anaxagoras  himself  never  used  the  concept  homoiomereia. 58 After  Aristotle,  homoiomere,  homoiomereiai, and other plurals  were  common in texts which refer to Anaxagoras. On the contrary, the singular homoiomereia was  not  so  common.  We  can  trace  the  singular  homoiomereia mainly  in  Lucretius, Simplicius, Themistius, and John Philoponus, but the term does not reflect Anaxago-\n\n51 Simplicius, In Aristotelis physicorum libros commentaria (n. 15 above) 10.1318. 29-30.\n\n52 Simplicius, On Aristotle Physics 8.6-10, trans.

As noted earlier, Pico's reference to the Demiurge and his phrasing suggests that he was drawing  from  Simplicius's  commentary  on  Aristotle's Physics .  But  given  that  Pico pursued a systematic study of Neoplatonism, he should have been familiar  with the idea that the Intellect ( Νοῦς ), the image of the One, is an emanation of the One. 62 According to Plotinus, the One remains in his undifferentiated unity and is not the Demiurge. 63 Plotinus  asserted  that  the  Intellect  is  identical  to  the  Platonic  Demiurge ( Δημιουργός ), 64 as described in Timaeus. Intellect contains the world of the Demiurge and is not the result of emanation or creation from the Demiurge. 65 Moreover, Plotinus criticized Anaxagoras that the latter's Intellect ( Νοῦς ) could not be temporally prior to matter; instead it is concurrent. 66 Even in the later Neoplatonists the scheme of emanation guarantees that the One is not a Demiurge. The cosmos is a product of the work of the lower hypostases, namely Intellect and Soul ( Ψυχή ). 67 In the Conclusiones, according to Porphyry, Pico admits that the Demiurge of the world is the supermundane soul:\n\n22.2.  Opifex  mundi  est  supermundana  anima. 68 (The  demiurge  of  the  world  is  the supermundane soul.) 69\n\n59 Lucretius, 'De rerum natura,' Titi Lucreti Cari De Rerum Natura Libri Sex, ed. C.

In my reading, in Pico's phrase opifex intellectus the noun intellectus is not a genitive but a nominative form, since the noun intellectus belongs to the fourth declension. As a result, the correct translation is Demiurge-Intellect, as in apposition, which seems to be accurate according to the Neoplatonic philosophy. Plotinus associates the Demiurge with  Intellect  and  not  with  the  One, 73 despite  Porphyry's  slightly  different  view. 74 Iamblichus follows the general pattern of Plotinus's argumentation and places Demiurge in the realm of the Intellect. Syrianus follows respectively on the same path. Finally,  Proclus  supports  that  the  Demiurge  exists  in  the  Intellect. 75 Moreover,  if  my reading is correct, Pico's argument no longer opposes the philosophy of Anaxagoras who claims that the Intellect sets the original mixture in motion and is not its Demiurge. 76 We have to bear in mind that Anaxagoras does not call the Intellect Demiurge nor does he conflate Intellect with God or divine principle, despite Iamblichus's quotation. 77 We must also have in mind that in the Commento Pico blames Ficino for the latter's  attempt  to  compromise  emanationism  and  creationism. 78 Moreover,  Pico's endeavor to present Moses philosophizing on the emanation of all things  from God remains on the level of verbal expression and is not a well documented and articulated view. 79 It is merely  a rhetorical exaggeration, which  aims  to strength Pico's syncretism in the Heptaplus . 80 Thus, any attempt to justify Farmer's translation, with the  argument  that  Pico  tried,  in  the  specific  passage,  to  compromise  emanation  and creation,  is  doomed  to  fail.    It  is  also  worth  noticing  that  according  to  Pico,  as  I mentioned earlier, being and One are coextensive, identical principles and must exist\n\n- 70 Proclus,  'In  Platonis  Timaeum Commentaria,' Procli Diadochi in Platonis Timaeum commentaria , ed.

Pico  simply  denominates.  Otherwise,  we  have  to  admit  that  Pico  has  no  thorough knowledge of Presocratic and Neoplatonic philosophy or that his philosophy is not so concrete.\n\nAlthough this a possible explanation, according to Pico's wording and the general meaning of the aforementioned passages of the Conclusiones , Pico sets forth another view in his Commento , a work which is written almost the same period with the Conclusiones . Pico holds that God creates Intellect, a perfect and unique creation. Despite the ambiguous wording of the passage, the last word is indicative:\n\ndico che Iddio ab aeterno produsse una creatura di natura incorporea ed intelletuale, tanto perfetta quanto è possibile e' sia una cosa creata. 83 (God from eternity produced a creature of incorporeal and intellectual nature, as perfect as is possible for a created being.)\n\nIn addition, Pico supports that Intellect, according to the Platonists, is the sole direct creation of God:\n\nimmediatamente  non  proviene  altra  creatura  che  questa  prima  mente. 84 (immediately  no other creature proceeds but this first mind.)\n\nBut the problem still persists. Pico uses three times words that refer to creation, while in  the  specific  and  subsequent  chapters  he  prefers produsse,  producere ,  and  other forms of the verb produco . Pico's terminology does not seem to be consistent enough. A possible explanation would be that in the specific chapter Pico's priority is the rejection of Ficino's argument that God creates directly also the human souls. 85 Furthermore, Pico mentions as his sources Plotinus, the famous Platonists, Aristotle, and all the  Arabs,  notably  Avicenna.  The  harmonization  of  the  opinions  of  the  aforementioned philosophers on the Intellect is rather superficial and not the outcome of solid argumentation.  In  the  mid-1480s  Pico's  philosophy  was  not  coherent. 86 In  addition, Pico's argumentation is ambivalent. He seems to lie simultaneously in Christian and Neoplatonic ground. Pico admits that, according to the Neoplatonists, the Intellect is\n\n81 G.

Dougherty (Cambridge 2008) 68-69.\n\nan emanation from the One and not a creation per se. 87 According to Michael Allen, Pico adds that God created the Ideas in the Intellect. 88 But Pico's text does not offer any evidence to support Allen's argument. Pico once again prefers types of the verb produco instead of creo .  The two verbs indicate different philosophical perspectives, as it  is  obvious.  Although Pico seems to be confused, the use of  words that refer to creation would be interpreted as rather loose interpretation of the Neoplatonic theory on the Intellect, since the general wording of the phrases suggests that creatura implies  the  emergence  of  One's  thought  and  thinking.  The  same  confusion  could  be found  and  in  other  passages  of  Pico's Commento . 89 But  Pico  insists.  Later  in  the Commento he argues that Intellect ( mente angelica )  consists of potency and act. Potency, the unlimited is equated with matter and act, the limit, is form. 90 The Aristotelian flavor of his philosophy is obvious despite the fact that Pico mentions a passage from  the  Platonic Philebus . 91 Intellect,  like  created  things,  is  consisted  of  different principles. But potency is imperfection. Furthermore, as Allen suggests, Pico's view lacks consistency. 92 Pico's contradictions have  further implications. In another passage he describes the Intellect ( anima intellettuale e angelica ) in a different way: unformed  substance,  the  original  prime  matter,  took  form  by  God  and  became Intellect. 93 This  is  not  an  act  of  pure  creation,  according  either  Christians  or  the Neoplatonists.  In  favor  of  my  translation  of  Pico's  phrase opifex  intellectus as Demiurge-Intellect is Pico's unambiguous affirmation that the Intellect creates the universe: dalla quale poi era produtto el resto del mondo (from which is produced the rest  of  the  world). 94 Similar  arguments  are  reproduced  and  in  other  passages  of  the Commento . 95\n\nAnaxagoras's quotation is crucial for Pico. Pico found in Anaxagoras the oldest ancient source which supported his key thesis that all things exist in all things in their own  mode,  although  he  has  the  impression  that  Moses  shared  the  same  view. 96 Anaxagoras's philosophy permits Pico to establish his doctrine that all things share a portion  of  God  within  them,  in  their  own  way.  As  a  result,  humans  are  capable  of achieving true knowledge and felicity. Philosophy is simply the ladder to God. 97 Despite the fact that Pico upholds the general pattern of medieval metaphysics, he rejects the fixed position of man in the ontological hierarchy. His anthropocentrism is prevalent.  Man  has  the  chance  to  become  everything.  Pico  asserts  that  man  contains  all things in himself as their center, just like God contains all things as their origin:\n\n- 87 Pico della Mirandola, 'Commento' (n. 78 above) 467-468.\n- 88 Allen, 'The Birth Day' (n. 20 above) 95.\n- 89 Pico della Mirandola, 'Commento' (n. 78 above) 511.\n- 90 Ibid. 472.\n- 91 Plato, 'Philebus,' Platonis opera , ed.

Anaxagoras  assumes  that  all  things  are  found  together  in  the original mixture and everything is in everything at all times. But this mixture was unlimited  ( ἄπειρον ),  undifferentiated  and  exists  eternally. 102 As  a  result, creatio  ex nihilo , which Pico defends, in a typical Platonic vocabulary and fashion, especially in his Heptaplus , 103 is  not  compatible  with  Anaxagoras's  model.  In  addition,  it  is  not clear whether Pico was aware of the fact that Anaxagoras's Intellect is the only thing in which the principle everything in everything does not apply, 104 since the Intellect is not  mixed,  let  aside  that  Anaxagoras's  Intellect  is  corporeal. 105 Pico  refutes  instead Anaxagoras's argument and insists that the Intellect  is  greatly  mixed,  since maxima mixtio  coincidit  cum  maxima  simplicitate  in  natura  intellectuali (since  the  greatest mixture coincides  with  the  greatest  simplicity  in  the  intellectual  nature). 106 Pico  expresses  a  similar  view  in  the Commento ,  where  he  argues  that  only  God  is  without discord, while the Intellect, as a mixture of potency and act, is composed of discord and concord. 107 Anaxagoras's  wording suggests that  there are some  things in  which Intellect is present, while in others Intellect is not present. 108 It  is  possible that Pico, despite his reliance on Proclus's thought, follows Plotinus's and not Proclus's interpretation  of  Anaxagoras's  philosophy  concerning  the  principle  everything  in  everything. 109 Plotinus's  interpretation,  although  attempted  in  passing,  is  convenient  for Pico's view that the greatest mixture coincides with the greatest simplicity in the intellectual nature. 110 Farmer holds that Pico comes to that paradoxical conclusion so as to reconcile Averroism and Christianity on the thorny issue of personal immortality. 111 Once again Farmer's argument is doubtful, since Pico calls Averroes an infidel, whose\n\n- 98 Pico della Mirandola, 'Heptaplus' (n. 21 above) 302.\n- 99 Pico della Mirandola, On the Dignity of Man (n. 4 above) 135.\n- 100 Pico della Mirandola, 'De hominis dignitate' (n. 4 above) 104-106.\n- 101 Sudduth, 'Pico' (n.  86 above) 69.\n- 102 DK (n. 10 above) B12.\n\n103 Allen,  'The  Birth  Day'  (n.  20  above)  104;  C.

Furthermore, Pico was forced  to  concede,  although  he  did  not  do  it,  that,  as  Plato  suggested, 113 while Anaxagoras's explanation is not simply materialistic, 114 is a solid physical explanation since there is no answer on the question why the intellect arranges things in the best possible way.\n\n- 112 G.
