Jackson ,  the  Supreme  Court  of  the  United  States  ruled  that  'the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion' [1]. Instead, whether there is a right to abortion must be determined by 'the people and their elected representatives'  [1].  Following Dobbs ,  U.S.  state  laws  on  abortion  have  changed  rapidly and diverged significantly. Amidst these changes, confusion over what is allowed under the law has led to reports of pregnant women with serious and life-threatening  conditions  being  denied  timely  treatment.  For  example,  Carpenter  et  al. lament  that  postDobbs ,  'there  are  more  cases  of  individuals  denied  abortion despite fetal demise or lethal fetal abnormality' [2, p. 310]. Arey et al. state that one provider in Texas 'reported that their hospital no longer offers treatment for ectopic pregnancies implanted in cesarean scars' [3, p. 389]. Minkoff, Vullikanti, and  Marshall  generalize  on  this  claim,  stating  that  'Texas  hospitals  no  longer offer treatment for ectopic pregnancies' [4, p. 15]. They also argue that anti-abortion policy 'endangers pregnant people who undergo any medical procedure that can harm a fertilized egg' [4, p. 15]. Prescriptions for 'immune and inflammatory disorders,' for example, may be withheld given these drugs' 'teratogenic effects on the fetus' [4, p. 15]. Nambiar et al. add that maternal morbidity seemingly runs higher in states with restrictive abortion laws [5]. Reportedly, '57% of patients' in their study had 'a serious maternal morbidity compared with 33% who elected immediate pregnancy interruption under similar clinical circumstances reported in states without such [restrictive] legislation' [5, p. 649]. So, changes to abortion restrictions  not  only  affect  abortion  access  but  access  to  other  interventions  as well which may, in turn, place women at grave risk of harm.\n\nSome concerns may be exaggerated. Contra Minkoff, Vullikanti, and Marshall, I have argued that Texas's statutes define 'abortion' in a way that does not apply to treatment for ectopic pregnancies generally [6, p. 201]. That there is significant confusion among scholars and clinicians over what is permitted, however, illustrates a need for clarity in 'the writing, revising, understanding, and applying of the  law'  [6,  p.  202].  Unfortunately,  what  state  laws  say  is  often  addressed  in  a piecemeal manner only. This occurs in recent work by Hersey, Potter-Rutledge, and Brown [7]-as well as Minkoff, Vullikanti, and Marshall [4]-where quotations from a few states' statutes are isolated because they serve the authors' purposes. Clarity will be best served by taking a wider look at differences between states' laws, however. Failure to do so overlooks two problems.\n\nFirst,  with  respect  to  abortion  and  reproductive  care,  calls  for  uniformity  in policy  across  jurisdictions  face  substantial  obstacles.  This  is  not  merely  due  to disagreement  over  the  permissibility  of  abortion.  It  is  also  because  there  is  no consensus in U.S. statutory law on what terms like 'abortion' mean. Not only do different  jurisdictions  draw  different  conclusions  as  to  whether  abortion  is  necessary (or permissible) in a given case; they also disagree on whether an abortion is even performed in many cases. When scholars discuss laws 'that seek to make abortion illegal,' [8, p. 952] therefore, they must recognize that the referent\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof 'abortion' varies across jurisdictions, so interventions prohibited by different states' abortion restrictions vary as well.\n\nSecond, given substantial variation across jurisdictions in terms like 'abortion,' statements from major medical organizations-like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which claims 'abortion is a safe, essential part of comprehensive health care'-will mean different things in different places [9]. This is not to deny that 'abortion is a safe, essential part' of care. I take no stance on the matter  here.  Rather,  if  the  meaning  of  'abortion'  is  highly  ambiguous,  then  it  is unclear which particular procedures are being referred to as 'safe' and 'essential' in a given jurisdiction. 1 As one example, consider the claim that 'abortion is required to treat ectopic pregnancy.' This is not regarded as true in every jurisdiction, even granting that some intervention is necessary to treat ectopic pregnancy. Thus, treatment  recommendations  that  are  intended  to  apply  across  jurisdictions-including federal recommendations-are unlikely to provide clear, effective guidance (that is, until  some  universally  accepted-or  universally  enforced-definitions  for  terms  like 'abortion' are employed). Absent clear guidance, and while widespread confusion over abortion law persists, the health and lives of many pregnant women remain at stake.\n\nI  will  address these concerns, beginning with a description of the major differences between U.S. states regarding how terms like 'abortion' are defined in statutory law. States almost universally assert that abortion involves 'termination of pregnancy.' Any real consensus is illusory, however, since 'pregnancy' and 'termination' are  often  defined  differently.  The  phrase,  'termination  of  pregnancy',  therefore, means different things in different jurisdictions, legally speaking.\n\nLooking closely at the statutory language, there are six variables on which state statutes often diverge. These variables generate six questions to consider when defining 'abortion' and related terms in public policy (whether in the U.S. or beyond):\n\n1. What is the definition of 'pregnancy' (i.e., what is the thing being terminated)?\n2. Does prescribing an abortion-inducing medication count as performing an abortion?\n3. Does abortion terminate pregnancy or is it merely an act performed with 'the intention to terminate pregnancy'?\n4. Aside from an 'intention to terminate pregnancy,' does abortion have any other characteristic intention(s)?\n5. Must a provider know that their action is likely to cause embryonic or fetal death?\n6. Must a provider know that the person receiving an abortion is pregnant?\n\n1 One may argue that ambiguity and disagreement on 'abortion' is isolated to the legal domain. Perhaps the medical community, by contrast, possesses clear, consistent definitions of 'abortion' and so, were legislators to follow medical experts on the meaning of terms, all manner of confusion and ambiguity would be eliminated. In the third section, I argue that this is false. 'Abortion' is highly ambiguous throughout the medical literature too.\n\nIn Sect. \"Six points of disagreement in U.S. statutory law\", I document how U.S. states (henceforth, 'states') each answer these questions in statutory law. I also consider the possible rationale behind (and implications for) different answers.\n\nIn Sect. Are legislators the problem?, I consider and respond to a major objection: that legislators , especially anti-abortion legislators, are solely to blame for confusion over 'abortion.' Donley and Kelly suggest this, asserting that, by introducing inconsistencies into legal definitions of 'abortion,' 'antiabortion legislatures are running a fool's errand' since 'it is impossible to fully distinguish abortion from other types of reproductive healthcare' [10, p. 1]. Rather than seek to define 'abortion' on their own, Donley and Kelly suggest that legislators should follow the medical community's lead (e.g., perhaps by codifying the 'medical definition' of 'abortion' into statutory law) [10, pp. 5-6]. In response, the medical domain does not fare much better than the legal domain when it comes to providing a clear, consistent definition of  'abortion.'  There  exists  no  canonical  'medical  definition'  of  'abortion.'  Confusion and ambiguity, therefore, are not isolated to the legal domain; they infect the medical domain too. Thus, in its present state,  the  medical community is also not well-positioned to resolve confusion over 'abortion.' Hence, both legal and medical domains stand to benefit from careful, rigorous discussions of how best to define 'abortion.'\n\nSince inconsistent  definitions  of  'abortion'  pervade  both  the  legal  and  medical domains, in Sect. Answering the six questions, I suggest answers to each of the six questions (listed above) that might facilitate the development of clear abortion policy in a polarized society. My intent is not to provide 'the right answers.' Rather, I defend reasonable answers for the specific purpose of developing clear policy. How best to answer each of these questions remains open for debate as does the question of who should answer each question (whether legislators, medical experts, philosophers, etc.). For this reason, my suggested answers should be read as initiating a conversation, not settling one.\n\nFinally, in Sect. A proposed definition of 'abortion', I use my proposed answers to formulate a definition of 'abortion.' I argue that a definition of 'abortion' should align with reasonable answers to all six questions and that, in polarized society, the definition should also limit its referents to exactly the cases that are in dispute (insofar as is possible). Such a definition would enable legislators to provide maximum clarity to clinicians (in terms of what is permitted) in cases of pregnancy termination where there are no real disputes. Furthermore, if one defines 'abortion' in this way,  then  abortion  bans  in  restrictive  states  would  prohibit  the  fewest  number  of practices possible (i.e., only those practices that are regarded as impermissible by a nonnegligible portion of the population). Limiting abortion restrictions to the fewest number of cases possible should appeal to abortion advocates, since it would ensure the greatest amount of reproductive autonomy in restrictive states. Restricting access to all and only the practices that are in dispute should also appeal to abortion opponents, since the law would still prohibit practices that they find objectionable. And achieving  maximum  clarity  in  policy-which  minimizes  unnecessary  harm  that results from confusion -should appeal to everyone.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs one last qualifier, readers may disagree with my suggested answers and proposed  definition  of  'abortion.'  By  identifying  six  major  sources  of  disagreement over 'abortion,' however, this essay provides a solid framework to rely upon when crafting clear and informative policies on abortion. This framework is fully applicable to jurisdictions outside of the U.S. and may be used to bring clarity to legal, medical, and academic discussions of abortion. For any abortion law, policy, statement, or argument, the same six questions must be answered in the interest of defining 'abortion' clearly. Clear guidance obviously matters since-aside from ensuring that experts are not talking past one another-the above reports indicate that confusion over abortion policy puts pregnant women at risk of serious harm and death. Thus, there are compelling reasons to work towards resolving confusion. This essay takes a major step towards doing so.\n\n## Six points of disagreement in U.S. statutory law\n\nI begin by documenting how each state within the U.S. responds to each of the six questions listed above. Obviously, there already exist many summaries of U.S. abortion law. Why should another summary matter? Because identifying differences in the definition of 'abortion' is critical when comparing states' laws. When 'abortion' is defined differently in each state, two states may appear to restrict abortion in the same way, but given different definitions  of  'abortion,'  what  is  restricted  actually differs.  Thus, effective comparisons  of  state  laws  requires  that  one first attend  to how each state  defines  'abortion.'  Relatedly,  consider  frequently-cited  polls-like the Gallup Poll-that describe Americans' attitudes toward abortion [11]. I establish that there is no real consistency in how 'abortion' is defined across jurisdictions (i.e., among legal experts). Nor is there consistency among medical experts. If so, then it seems absurd to think that laypeople possess anything like a clear, consistent definition of 'abortion' when responding to polls and surveys. Thus, whether one is comparing state laws or surveying the public on their attitudes towards abortion, this research would be far more meaningful if one begins by getting clear on what 'abortion' means. This is one major feature of my analysis that sets it apart from others (and, in that regard, it provides the basis for more meaningful empirical research on abortion). 2\n\n2 To my knowledge, only Donley and Kelly have produced anything like my overview of state definitions  [10].  Their  work  was  produced  concurrently  with  (and  independently  from)  my  own.  That  said, they do not provide the same six-variable framework that I develop. Nor do they describe each state's definition  in  the  same  fine-grained  detail.  And,  as  will  be  shown  below,  Donley  and  Kelly  argue  that the solution to confusion over 'abortion' in law is to leave medical providers alone and to stop trying to regulate abortion [10, p. 73]. This suggestion will appeal only to abortion proponents, so it does nothing to advance debates over abortion. More importantly, in the third section of this essay, I tackle this suggestion directly, arguing that inconsistent definitions of 'abortion' pervade the medical domain too, a fact that Donley and Kelly underappreciate. Thus, contra Donley and Kelly, it is a mistake to look to today's medical community for clarity on 'abortion,' since clarity is elusive there as well.\n\n## Competing definitions of 'pregnancy'\n\nNearly  every  state  defines  abortion  as  involving  'termination  of  pregnancy.'  The meaning of this phrase varies, however, since 'pregnancy' is often defined differently (see Table 1). 3\n\nEighteen  states  define  pregnancy  as  beginning  at  conception  (or  fertilization). Seven  states  assert  that  pregnancy  begins  with  implantation  (namely,  when  an embryo  attaches  itself  to  the  uterine  wall).  Conception  and  implantation  are  two distinct  biological  events,  however.  Conception  always  precedes  implantation  by around six days [12]. This means that legally speaking, someone may count as pregnant in one state but not pregnant in others.\n\nHow 'pregnancy' is defined affects policy on contraceptives [13]. Contraceptives, by definition, prevent pregnancy from occurring. In principle, this means that interventions that allow conception but prevent implantation-including certain intrauterine devices [12]-may count as contraceptives in some states and non-contraceptives in others. For any intervention known to prevent implantation, therefore, access to that intervention may be restricted in states that outlaw abortion. To those who believe pregnancy begins at implantation-who subsequently believe that relevant interventions are contraceptives-this may look like legislative overreach rooted in 'bad science' [14]. Worse, for interventions that may prevent  implantation,  states that claim pregnancy begins at conception might regard these interventions as abortifacients and restrict their use accordingly.\n\nTo  complicate  matters,  some  states  that  claim  pregnancy  begins  at  conception also  explicitly  define  anti-implantation  methods  as  'contraceptives'  nonetheless. See, for example, Arizona [15], Idaho [16], Kansas [17], and South Carolina [18]. In these states, interventions that (by definition) interrupt pregnancy are classified as 'contraceptives' (which, by definition, prevent pregnancy). So, not only does the meaning of terms like 'pregnancy' and 'contraceptive' vary across jurisdictions, but some states define terms inconsistently. Subsequent confusion over which interventions are legally permitted is therefore unsurprising.\n\n## 'Termination' as performing, prescribing, or both?\n\n'Pregnancy' aside, if abortion involves 'termination of pregnancy,' what does 'termination' mean? Methods of termination often include medication, surgical devices, suction, etc. On this point, state laws usually align: the method of termination is not usually considered relevant to whether an act counts as an abortion or not. Where states differ is regarding acts of prescribing (see Table 2).\n\nIf  merely  prescribing  an  abortifacient  is  the  same  as  performing  an  abortion, then  concerns  raised  in  the  previous  section-regarding  what  counts  as  a  contraceptive-are compounded. Prescribers must not only understand how 'pregnancy' and 'contraceptive' are defined within their jurisdiction, but they must also know whether they perform an abortion simply by prescribing a drug. Subsequently, it is\n\n3 See the Appendix for a list of state statutes referenced when generating the tables in this essay. All tables were generated as of February 14, 2024, so some state statutes may have changed since that time.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nunsurprising if some providers are hesitant to prescribe drugs that may count as an abortifacient,  especially  when  doing  so  might  amount  to  performing  an  abortion, legally speaking.\n\nIf prescribing does not constitute performing an abortion, then states with restrictive abortion laws are in a difficult position. Historically, anti-abortion laws aimed primarily  to  penalize  abortion  providers  rather  than  patients  [19-21].  With  selfadministered  prescriptions,  however,  patients  seemingly  become  the  providers. Laws that currently penalize providers, therefore, would seemingly have to penalize patients directly [22]. For restrictive states that wish to penalize medical providers rather than patients, therefore, identifying acts of prescribing as 'abortions' offers a solution: prescribers are penalized, but patients who self-administer abortifacients are not. Still, doing so is confusing, because it blurs an intuitive distinction between performing an abortion and enabling the performance of an abortion. 4\n\n## Must abortion actually terminate pregnancy?\n\nNext, states disagree over whether an abortion is an act that terminates pregnancy or merely an act performed 'with the intention to terminate pregnancy' (see Table 3).\n\nActs that terminate pregnancy differ from acts performed with an intention to terminate pregnancy. After all, actions done 'with the intention to terminate' may fail. Similarly, pregnancy may be terminated without an agent intending that termination occur. As a result, these distinctions generate four categories of actions to consider, any of which could be a referent of 'abortion':\n\n1. Actions done with the intention to terminate pregnancy that terminate pregnancy,\n2. Actions done with the intention to terminate pregnancy that do not terminate pregnancy,\n3. Actions done with no intention to terminate pregnancy that terminate pregnancy, and\n4. Actions done with no intention to terminate pregnancy that do not terminate pregnancy.\n\nIn  11  states,  abortion  is  an  action  performed  with  the  intention  to  terminate pregnancy. In these jurisdictions, some actions in categories 1 and 2 are the referent of 'abortion.' In 22 states, where abortion is an action that terminates pregnancy,  some  actions  in  categories  1  and  3  are  the  referent  of  'abortion.'  In  15 states, sometimes 'abortion' refers to categories 1 and 2, but other times, 'abortion' refers to categories 1 and 3. Within these states, therefore, the meaning of 'abortion' varies by context. Fortunately, there is some overlap here. Across jurisdictions, actions in category 1 are generally regarded as abortions and actions in\n\n4 Collapsing the distinction between performing and enabling also renders unclear the matter of who is complicit (or cooperating with) an abortion when the means of prescribing and taking an abortifacient fall outside of any traditional physician-patient relationship. I am grateful to Cody Feikles for raising this point.\n\n## Table 1 Definitions of 'pregnancy'\n\nHow does each state define 'pregnancy'?\n\nPregnancy begins at conception.

Inconsistencies on categories 2 and 3, however, remain a potential source of confusion.\n\nWorse, 'termination'  is  ambiguous  in  another  way,  not  reflected  by  Table  3. 'Termination' may refer to an act that transitions a pregnant individual to a state of non-pregnancy or it may refer to an act that causes the death of an embryo or fetus [23, 24]. Accounting for this ambiguity doubles the number of categories to which 'abortion' might refer. Category 1, for instance, would split into two forms:\n\n1a. Actions done with the intention to transition a pregnant individual to a state of non-pregnancy that do so, or\n\n1b. Actions done with the intention to cause the death of an embryo or fetus that do so.\n\nDepending on how one defines 'termination,' therefore, 'abortion' will refer to different  sets  of  actions.  Suppose,  for  example,  that  someone  seeks  an  abortion and, following the intervention, her fetus is born alive. States that rely on 1a may refer to the provider's action as an abortion. States that rely on 1b may describe that action as an attempted abortion only (since the fetus did not die).\n\nSimilarly, when a salpingostomy is performed to remove a tubal ectopic pregnancy-where an incision is made into the fallopian tube and the embryo within it is extracted, intact-states relying on 1a may regard this action as an abortion. States relying on 1b may not, since performing a salpingostomy in this way need not carry an intention to cause the embryo's death [25, 26]. Thus, the same procedure may count as an 'abortion' in some states, but not in others.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Table 3 On termination.

After  all,  every  induced  vaginal  delivery  and  every cesarean section is performed with an intention to terminate pregnancy in the sense described by 1a, above. But no state regards all deliveries as 'abortions.' To say otherwise would be to overgeneralize on 'abortion.'\n\nTo avoid overgeneralization, state statutes typically structure language in one of two ways. Some states assert that, by definition, abortion involves having a specific (characteristic) intention, such as 'killing the embryo or fetus.' If so, then presumably,  acts  performed  without  this  intention  are  not  abortions.  Alternatively,  most states assert that abortion is an act performed with any intention (or purpose) 'other than' those on a specified list. For example, many states assert that 'abortion' refers to  acts  that  terminate  pregnancy done with any intention other than 'treatment of ectopic pregnancy,' 'preserving the health of the fetus,' and so forth (see Table 4 for an overview). 5\n\nIf 'abortion' refers only to acts performed with a specific intention, then the referent of 'abortion' is relatively narrow. In principle, under this definition, someone who self-administers an abortifacient while intending 'only not to be pregnant' does not perform an abortion.\n\nAlternatively,  if  'abortion'  refers  to  any  termination  performed without certain intentions, then the term refers to many more phenomena. On this view, someone who  self-administers  an  abortifacient  while  intending  'only  not  to  be  pregnant'\n\n5 Table 4 lets each state answer the fourth question more than once. This is because some states have two or more statutes that answer question 4 differently. Iowa, for example, has one statute that says abortion involves termination with any intention 'other than' the intention to remove fetal remains (without further qualification) [27]. A different Iowa statute, however, gives a different answer, stating that abortion  involves  termination  with  any  intention  'other  than'  the  intention  to  remove  fetal  remains  where fetal death occurred naturally (i.e., in cases of 'spontaneous abortion') [28]. So, in Iowa, removal of fetal remains following induced fetal demise may, in principle, count as an abortion under the latter statute, but not under the former statute. So, not only are there inconsistencies between states regarding how they answer the fourth question, but some states also possess multiple statutes that answer the same question differently. The source of confusion, therefore, is not limited to interstate inconsistencies. Confusion may also stem from intra state inconsistencies, where some states have multiple, conflicting definitions of 'abortion.'.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwould likely perform an abortion. Still, on this second approach, not every termination counts as an abortion. In 19 states, termination performed with an intention to treat ectopic pregnancy is not an abortion, legally speaking. So, any abortion ban in these states will not prohibit treatment for ectopic pregnancy. To clarify, treatment for ectopic pregnancy in these 19 states is not permitted because it is regarded as a 'medically necessary abortion.' Rather, treatment for ectopic pregnancy is permitted because it is not considered an abortion in the first place.\n\nRegarding how intentions (allegedly) distinguish abortions from non-abortions, states often provide conflicting answers. One Kentucky statute, for example, defines 'abortion' as an action performed 'with intent to cause fetal death' [29]. This is why it appears in row 1 of Table 4. When discussing abortion performed on minors, however, a different Kentucky statute defines 'abortion' as an action done 'with intent other than to increase the probability of a live birth … or to remove a dead fetus' [30]. Hence, Kentucky also appears in rows 2 and 5 of Table 4. So, within one state, sometimes  abortion  is  said  to  involve  having  a  specific  intention  and  sometimes abortion is said to involve having any intention other than those specified.\n\nThere is nothing inherently wrong with states and scholars defining the same term differently in different contexts. But here, doing so risks exacerbating confusion over abortion policy. As Table 4 shows, states usually provide contextualized (if not conflicting)  answers  to  the  fourth  question.  Accordingly,  confusion  among  clinicians, scholars, and the public is to be expected.\n\n## Knowledge of potential harms\n\nIntentions  aside,  states  often  consider  providers'  knowledge  when  distinguishing abortion from non-abortive acts. To illustrate why, suppose a clinician terminates a  pregnancy  at  12-weeks'  gestation  while  truthfully  stating  that  her  sole  intention was to produce a live birth. If intention were all that mattered, this might preclude  her  action  from  counting  as  an  abortion,  legally  speaking.  However,  this  is counterintuitive.\n\nOne  solution  is  to  claim  the  clinician should  have  known  better .  Namely,  she should  have  known  that  fetuses  cannot  survive  if  pregnancy  is  terminated  at 12-weeks' gestation. That providers know (or should know) their actions threaten embryos or fetuses, therefore, is factored into some states' definitions of 'abortion' explicitly (see Table 5).\n\nIn 31 states, 'abortion' is defined without reference to providers' knowledge of the danger their actions likely pose to embryos or fetuses. In those states, someone may terminate pregnancy-not knowing it will likely cause fetal death-and still perform an abortion.\n\nFor 19 states-which do build a knowledge requirement into their definitionsignorance  may  distinguish  abortions  from  non-abortive  acts.  Someone  who  does not know that her action is likely to cause fetal death, for instance, may be said not to perform an abortion when terminating pregnancy. In 7 of these 19 jurisdictions, language  varies  between  statutes.  One  Colorado  statute,  for  example,  asserts  that abortion performed on minors occurs when providers act 'with knowledge that the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Table 4 Characteristic intention(s).

Yet, when defining 'abortion' generally, a different Colorado statute omits this knowledge requirement [32]. Again, there is nothing inherently wrong with contextualizing different definitions of 'abortion.' But it is hardly surprising when doing so causes confusion. 6\n\n6 This example is of interest given that Guttmacher categorizes Colorado as a 'protective' state with respect to abortion access [33]. Yet, there are intrastate inconsistencies-which are one source of confusion-within Colorado's  statutes.  This  renders  dubious  any  suggestion  that  restrictive  states-or  antiabortion legislators-are alone when defining 'abortion' in inconsistent or confusing ways, as Donley\n\nTable 5 Knowledge of harm\n\n| Does performing an abortion explicitly require knowledge that the intervention is reasonably likely to cause the death of an embryo or fetus?                    | Does performing an abortion explicitly require knowledge that the intervention is reasonably likely to cause the death of an embryo or fetus?   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Yes, providers must act 'with knowledge' that their action 'will, with reasonable likelihood, cause the death of' the embryo, fetus, or 'unborn child.'

In principle, this means someone could avoid  performing  an  abortion  if  they  are  uncertain  about  whether  the  recipient (including oneself) is pregnant. Women who suspect they are pregnant could then self-administer medication designed to terminate pregnancy and, given their uncertainty, this may not qualify as an abortion (strictly speaking).\n\nPerhaps to avoid these kinds of loopholes, 24 states unequivocally lower the bar, stating that pregnancy needs only to be 'clinically diagnosable' or that knowledge of pregnancy is irrelevant when distinguishing abortion from non-abortive acts. One also sees 16 states making contextualized (if not conflicting) claims on this matter.\n\nIn sum, there is no consensus in U.S. statutory law on 'abortion.' There are (at least)  six  questions  to  consider  when  defining  'abortion'  in  law.  How  should  one respond  to  these  inconsistencies?  I  propose  that  one  answer  the  six  questions  in whatever way would best facilitate the development of clear public policy in this (polarized) society. I will endeavor to do so in Sect. Answering the six questions4. Not  everyone  agrees  with  this  strategy,  however.  Some  authors,  like  Donley  and Kelly,  insist  that  confusion  over  'abortion'  is  primarily  the  fault  of  anti-abortion legislators who, in effect, have usurped the role of medical experts when defining 'abortion' and related terms [10]. Allow me to consider this claim.\n\n## Are legislators the problem?\n\nPerhaps legislators, especially anti-abortion legislators, are to blame for confusion over 'abortion.' One might think that the medical community, by comparison, does not suffer from this problem. As one anonymous reviewer remarks, 'in medicine,\n\nFootnote 6 (continued)\n\nand Kelly suggest [10].\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Table 6 Knowledge of pregnancy\n\n|             | DE, IL, KY, MN, NC, NJ,

An  abortion  is  the  removal  or  threatened removal of pregnancy tissue, products of conception or the fetus and placenta (afterbirth).' The reviewer adds, 'while lawmakers may disagree on definitions in their attempts to limit access to medical and procedural abortions, the medical definition of the term has never varied over decades of practice and training.' So, if anyone is to blame for confusion over abortion, it is legislators , not medical experts.\n\nAn exhaustive survey of medical literature-to test whether 'abortion' is defined consistently throughout-goes beyond the scope of this essay. So does an empirical survey to determine whether 'abortion' is defined consistently by providers. It would certainly be interesting to survey a large number of providers regarding the six questions listed above. 7 But I cannot do that here. Still, I can at least begin to  test  the objector's claim. If the objector is correct, then there should be relatively homogenous answers to each of the six questions throughout medical literature. At a quick glance, however, such homogeneity is not there.\n\nConsider the following definitions of 'abortion,' which come from medical dictionaries, resources for clinical guidance (like UpToDate), and statements by professional organizations, like those made by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). Here is a sample of how 'abortion' is defined by these sources:\n\nReviewer's Definition: Abortion is 'the removal or threatened removal of pregnancy tissue, products of conception or the fetus and placenta (afterbirth).'\n\nWilliams  Obstetrics : Abortion  is  'the  spontaneous  or  induced  termination  of pregnancy before fetal viability' [34, p. 198].\n\nMerriam-Webster Medical Dictionary : Abortion is 'the termination of a pregnancy after, accompanied by, resulting in, or closely followed by the death of the embryo or fetus' [35].\n\nACOG: Abortion is 'an intervention intended to terminate a pregnancy so that it does not result in a live birth' [36].\n\nUpToDate: Abortion 'refers to pregnancy loss up to 20 weeks (sometimes called spontaneous abortion) or pregnancy termination at any gestational age' [37].\n\nNone of these sources define 'abortion' in the same way. The definitions are not merely reworded assertions of the same claim either. They differ on substantial matters. This fact is sometimes overlooked. When praising the medical profession for consistency in  defining  'abortion,'  for  example,  Donley  and  Kelly  cite  the  definitions of 'abortion' from both Williams Obstetrics and the Merriam-Webster Medical Dictionary , quoted here [10, 34, 35]. Ironically, Donley and Kelly fail to appreciate that those two sources define 'abortion' quite differently. Here, therefore, are three examples of how these definitions differ in substantial ways.\n\nFirst,  on  the  reviewer's  definition,  'abortion'  refers  to  every  delivery,  since  it includes  'removal'  of  'the  fetus  and  placenta'  without  qualification.  There  is  no specification  as  to  whether  delivery  results  in  a  live  birth  or  not.  Nor  does  it  say\n\n7 It  would be interesting to survey laypeople on those six questions as well. As noted above, doing so might reveal that public polls on abortion are far less meaningful than is sometimes supposed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwhether delivery occurs before viability or after. Removal of the fetus and placenta occurs in all cases of birth, however. So, on the reviewer's definition, all born human beings have been aborted. By contrast, on the definition from Williams Obstetrics -which Donley and Kelly hail as 'the preeminent Obstetrics textbook' [10]-abortion  applies  only  to  events  that  occur  'before  fetal  viability'  [34].  Deliveries  that occur after fetal viability are, by definition, non-abortive acts. So, Williams Obstetrics defines 'abortion' in a substantially different way than the reviewer. The former is more restrictive than the latter, since the reviewer's definition refers to all 'removals,' while the Williams Obstetrics definition only refers to some of them. 8\n\nSecond, ACOG explicitly builds intention into its definition of 'abortion' [36]. The  other  four  sources  do  not.  This  means  that  what  counts  as  abortion  under ACOG's definition  will  not  always  count  as  abortion  under  other  definitions.  To illustrate, for decades, Catholic bioethicists and physicians have argued that removal of an ectopic pregnancy via salpingectomy is not necessarily an abortion-at least not a direct abortion-because such removals do not require acting with an intention to cause the death of the embryo (or prevent live birth). Rather, such acts may be  performed  with  the  intention  to  remove  a  diseased  organ  (i.e.,  the  tube  which will likely burst if left untreated) even though the act will result in the unintended death of the embryo [38, 39]. 9 ACOG's definition is consistent with these claims. That is, both ACOG and Catholic scholars will, at times, agree that certain interventions do not count as abortions, even if the ethical reasoning behind their respective judgments differs significantly. Specifically, an ectopic pregnancy may be removed with  no  intention  to  prevent  live  birth.  So,  under  ACOG's  definition,  removal  of an  ectopic  pregnancy  (and  removal  of  other  previable  pregnancies,  for  that  matter)  will  not  necessarily  count  as  'abortion.'  This  squares  with  the  perspective  of certain  Catholic  scholars  mentioned  above.  Moreover,  the  American  Association of  Pro-Life  Obstetricians  and  Gynecologists  (AAPLOG)-which is comprised, in part,  by  medical  experts-makes  the  same  claim,  asserting  that  treating  ectopic pregnancy 'is not the same thing as performing an abortion' [40]. Yet, removal of an ectopic pregnancy will count as an abortion under other medical definitions of 'abortion.' After all, such removals will always be 'closely followed by the death of the embryo.' So, under the Merriam-Webster definition, these removals would likely count as abortions [35].\n\n8 The definition given by Williams Obstetrics is a nonstarter, at any rate, because it implies that abortion cannot occur after fetal viability. This is obviously false. I need not assess the merits of definitions here, however, as my goal is simply to provide evidence that 'medical' definitions of 'abortion' vary substantially.\n\n9 There is an ambiguity in discussions of ectopic pregnancy within Catholic circles. Some regard treatment for ectopic pregnancy not to be an abortion at all (at least when intent to kill an embryo is absent) [38]. Others distinguish between 'direct abortion' and 'indirect abortion,' where the former involves an intent to kill, but the latter does not (and only the former is categorically prohibited) [39]. Thus, certain treatments for ectopic pregnancy (e.g., salpingectomy, which removes the fallopian tube containing an embryo without acting directly on the embryo) are either non-abortive or indirectly abortive (which can be morally justified under certain circumstances). The question to consider, therefore, is whether 'indirect abortions' are abortions at all. I take no stance on the matter, but note the ambiguity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhich  definition  is  correct?  Which  is  canonical?  These  are  the  questions  that should  be  considered,  both  within  the  medical  community  and  beyond  it.  What should  not  be  tolerated  are  undefended  (not  to  mention  incorrect)  assertions  that the  medical  community  currently  possesses  clear,  consistent,  canonical  answers. So, when one anonymous reviewer asserts-without defense-that 'from a medical perspective, abortion is required to treat ectopic pregnancy is absolutely true,' the above discussion shows that this claim is, at most, contingently true. It is contingent upon which 'medical definition' one adopts. Given ACOG's definition (and AAPLOG's statement), the reviewer's claim is false. Given the Merriam-Webster definition, the reviewer's claim is true. Who is right (and why)? These are conversations worth having.\n\nThird,  UpToDate's  definition  extends  'abortion'  to  'termination  at  any  gestational age' [37]. In doing so, it contradicts the Williams Obstetrics definition, since the latter only concerns acts performed prior to fetal viability. Stating that abortion involves 'termination at any gestational age' does not specify whether fetuses survive the process either. So, UpToDate's definition does not obviously refer to the same phenomena captured by the Merriam-Webster definition, which requires fetal demise. Thus, a cursory glance suggests that 'medical definitions' of 'abortion' differ in terms of which gestational age range is relevant, whether intention is relevant, whether fetal demise must occur, and so on. 10 Bald assertions that there exists widespread consistency on 'abortion,' therefore, do not appear to be grounded in fact.\n\nThe objector could respond that medical experts all know what 'abortion' means, even  if  their  formal  writing  on  the  topic  suggests  otherwise.  That  strikes  me  as implausible if not intellectually dishonest. If, by and large, medical experts all agree on the meaning of 'abortion,' one would expect far more consistency in 'authoritative' texts and statements than the evidence reveals. Still, one might think that I am engaged in fruitless nitpicking. In fact, one anonymous reviewer accuses me of 'playing definitional games' which 'is not only dangerous but also disrespectful.' I disagree. I am seeking and advocating for clarity. Continued ambiguity, inconsistency, and confusion, whether in legal contexts or medical contexts, likely risks lives. Insisting that there is clarity-when, in fact, there is not-only obscures the problem. In my view, denying that a real problem exists, especially without defense , is far more 'dangerous' than revealing the problem and seeking to resolve it.\n\nIn sum, my main claim in this section has been that there does not appear to exist a canonical 'medical definition' of 'abortion' today, let alone a definition that has 'never varied over decades' (to borrow an anonymous reviewer's phrase). The medical domain resembles the legal domain in this regard: 'abortion' is highly ambiguous. Lest I risk alienating medical experts further, however, observe that this finding\n\n10 As another point of disagreement, some definitions explicitly extend 'abortion' to include naturally occurring  fetal  demise  (as  in  cases  of  'spontaneous  abortion')  whereas  others  do  not.  The  NHS,  for example, asserts that 'an abortion is different from a miscarriage, which is the loss of your baby before 24  weeks,  without  medical  intervention'  [41].  This  obviously  conflicts  with  definitions  of  'abortion' given by Williams Obstetrics and UpToDate .  It  also  raises  the  question  of  whether 'spontaneous abortion' should be called 'abortion' at all. I am not interested in that question here, however, since my goal is simply to provide evidence that there is no uncontroversial, clear, canonical definition of 'abortion' on offer within the medical community.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nis  compatible  with  thinking  that  medical  experts  are the  most  important  participants in conversations about how 'abortion' should be defined. Outsiders need not encroach upon the medical community's territory, nor must they unilaterally impose upon the medical community their own definitions. Rather, my view is that there are compelling reasons to seek clarity on 'abortion' across legal, medical, and academic domains. Who should 'lead the charge' is open for discussion.\n\nNo  matter  who  is  thought  most  qualified  to  define  'abortion,'  however,  there need not be an adversarial relationship between medical and non-medical personnel here. An interdisciplinary approach is perfectly possible. And, given that abortion raises ethical, legal, medical, biological, cultural, and metaphysical questions, an  interdisciplinary  approach  seems  necessary  anyway.  Fortunately,  professionals trained  in  law,  medicine,  philosophy,  etc.,  can  work  together  towards  developing clear language, definitions, and policy. Such an endeavor would truly be in the spirit of bioethics as well, since bioethics is inherently interdisciplinary. Indeed, as professional bioethics came into being, Daniel Callahan observed 'an unwritten rule that no one, under any circumstances, should try to pull disciplinary rank' [42, p. 28]. When medical experts  (or  others)  'pull  disciplinary  rank'-by  insisting  that  they alone control some space that clearly calls for interdisciplinary discussions-doing so both impoverishes and runs contrary to bioethical inquiry.\n\nThis essay, by contrast, embodies an interdisciplinary spirit. It provides a framework  that  highlights  critical  aspects  of  'abortion'  to  consider  when  defining  our terms across domains. It does so, moreover, in a way that is neutral with respect to the morality of abortion. As argued above, in pursuit of clarity in public policy, the framework provides six questions to consider when defining 'abortion.' I conclude by proposing how one might best answer these six questions and how one might best define 'abortion' within a polarized society.\n\n## Answering the six questions\n\nWhen considering the six questions as they pertain to public policy, there are two options. First, one could allow every citizen to answer each question as they see fit. That is, the state could simply stay out of the matter. Second, one might give wellreasoned answers to each question, which could then inform public policy. The second approach is preferable in a polarized society. Here is why.\n\nOn the first option, it may seem that allowing every individual to decide for themselves  what  'abortion'  means  exemplifies  a  commitment  to  individual  liberty  and pluralism. As one anonymous reviewer argues, this approach 'would be a truly pluralistic response' to resolving disputes over abortion. Appearances aside, however, this approach would entail a surrender of policy to abortion proponents. As Beckwith explains, in the now-defunct Roe v. Wade ,  Justice Blackmun argued that 'the word 'person,' as used in the Fourteenth Amendment, does not include the unborn' [20, p. 27]. Yet, if the word 'person' did include the unborn, Blackmun conceded, then under the U.S. Constitution, any right to abortion 'collapses,' since the Fourteenth  Amendment would protect the  'fetus's  right  to  life'  [20,  p.  30].  Here,  the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSupreme Court openly admitted that the right to abortion seemingly requires that states deny the personhood of 'the unborn.'\n\nSuppose, then, that the state allows everyone to define 'abortion' and obtain one as they see fit. This policy commits the state to the claim that embryos and fetuses are not persons under the Constitution. Yet, that is the very claim that abortion opponents  often  dispute  [20,  43].  This  means  that  the  state  cannot  be  neutral  when  it comes to abortion [20]. Allowing legal access to abortion requires excluding 'the unborn' from counting as persons. So, allowing every citizen to define 'abortion' as they see fit (and obtain one at will) works, as a policy, only if abortion proponents'  beliefs  and  values  are  codified  into  public  policy  at  the  most  fundamental level. Thus, this proposal is not a viable solution within a polarized society like the U.S. The 'solution' will appeal only to abortion proponents. If allowing every citizen to define 'abortion' as they see fit is not a real solution, therefore, I propose that one works to provide well-reasoned answers to each of the six questions, which can then inform public policy.\n\n## Defining 'pregnancy'\n\nDisputes  over  the  meaning  of  'pregnancy'  are  well-documented  [44].  Medical experts often state that 'pregnancy' begins at implantation. As Rachel Gold notes, claiming  'pregnancy  begins  at  conception'  would  mean  going  'against  the  longstanding view of the medical profession' that says pregnancy begins at implantation [13, p. 7]. ACOG states that 'fertilization … is the first step … that leads to pregnancy' [45, emphasis added]. The NIH and NHS concur [46, 47]. So, pregnancy purportedly begins after conception, not at conception. Yet, in ordinary language, 'pregnancy' is commonly defined as beginning at conception [48]. Which definition is correct (and why)? Answering this philosophical question is beyond the scope of medical science.\n\nSome readers may disagree. One may think that defining 'pregnancy' is strictly a  medical  matter,  in  that  pregnancy  begins  when  human  chorionic  gonadotrophin (hCG) is  produced.  Since  this  occurs  sometime  after  conception,  pregnancy  cannot  be  said  to  begin at conception  [9].  Yet,  does  hCG  production  mark  the start of pregnancy or is it merely an effect of pregnancy already underway? What medical (or scientific) reason is there to favor one answer over the other? Further, when one insists that production of hCG marks the start of pregnancy, I worry that this is equating pregnancy with detectable pregnancy. By comparison, there is a difference between having cancer and having cancer that is detectable. Cancer does not begin to exist the moment it becomes detectable. Nor does cancer begin to exist the moment it is detected. The same can be said for pregnancy. 11 I understand that the medical community may choose to define 'pregnancy' in a particular way. But that\n\n11 One reviewer pushes back, arguing that 'pregnancy is clinically defined by the existence of a positive pregnancy test.' Since a positive pregnancy test cannot exist at conception, this implies that pregnancy begins after conception. The existence of a positive pregnancy test does not cause pregnancy, however. A positive pregnancy test may just as well be regarded as evidence of a pregnancy that is already underway.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nis different from showing that there are good medical or good scientific reasons for doing  so.  Absent  compelling  reason  for  their  choice,  a  collective  endorsement  of defining 'pregnancy' as beginning at implantation looks like an arbitrary pragmatic decision.\n\nFortunately, when it comes to public policy, one can bypass this debate. The central  ethical  issue  in  debates  over  abortion  is  the  treatment  of  embryos and fetuses (henceforth,  'embryos'). 12 If  the  abortion  debate  is  fundamentally  over  the  treatment of embryos, then as a matter of public policy, interventions should be sorted clearly into two categories: those that harm embryos and those that do not. If interventions that could potentially harm embryos are clearly labeled as such, then the definition of 'pregnancy' is not especially important. As is, given that 'pregnancy' is often defined by medical experts as beginning at implantation, this provides room for medical professionals and pharmaceutical companies to obscure the deleterious effects that some interventions may have on pre-implanted embryos [57]. One worry with defining 'pregnancy' as beginning at implantation, therefore, is that some interventions that harm embryos might not be clearly marketed as such.\n\nIf  public  policy  states  that  pregnancy  begins  at  implantation,  then  anti-implantation interventions-which prevent embryos from implanting in the uterus and so, harm them, even if only indirectly-may be labeled 'contraceptives.' Imagine, then, that  anti-implantation interventions are marketed or prescribed as 'contraceptives' on the basis that they prevent implantation and, therefore, prevent 'pregnancy.' For women who think that pregnancy begins  at  conception  and  who  wish  not  to  kill embryos, they may use these interventions thinking they prevent conception only. Hence, some women may be misled into unknowingly doing things they regard as morally abhorrent. Defining pregnancy as beginning at conception would eliminate this risk, as it would require that anti-implantation methods be marketed (and prescribed) as abortifacients.\n\nStill,  if  'pregnancy'  is  defined  as  beginning  at  conception,  this  could  enable  restrictive  states  to  ban  access  to  known  (or  suspected)  anti-implantation\n\nFootnote 11 (continued)\n\nNor is a positive test a necessary condition for pregnancy. After all, if a positive test were a necessary condition for pregnancy, then there could be someone with a 40-week-old, healthy fetus in her uterus who is, by the reviewer's definition, not pregnant (at least not 'clinically'). This strikes me as absurd. Worse, some pregnancy tests yield false positives. As such, a 'positive pregnancy test' may exist, while a pregnancy does not. The reviewer's claim implies that a pregnancy does exist when a positive pregnancy test  exists.  So,  on  the  reviewer's  view,  it  seems  there  can  be  no  such  thing  as  a  false  positive.  That  is obviously false. Regardless, there seems to be a collapse of the distinction between pregnancy, on one hand, and detected (or detectable) pregnancy on the other. These points are mostly tangential, however, so I shall set them aside.\n\n12 Some scholars disagree, claiming that abortion restrictions are generally in place to 'control women' [49].  Yet,  anti-abortion  scholars  exhibit  significant  uniformity  in  opposing  the  killing  of  embryos,  not women's freedoms [50, 51]. The same goes for prominent secular and feminist organizations that oppose abortion: killing is  the  issue,  'controlling  women'  is  not  [52,  53].  Indeed,  many  female  authors  have argued that  abortion itself is  anti-feminist,  an  expression  of  sexism,  and  a  'masculine'  solution  to  the 'problem of unwanted pregnancy.' [54-56]. Dismissing abortion opposition as inherently 'sexist,' 'antifeminist,'  or  as  primarily  about  'controlling  women,'  therefore,  is  unwarranted.  This  is  not  to  say  that 'controlling women' is irrelevant to every anti-abortion expression, defender, or movement. Rather, my claim is that it is unreasonable to cast all abortion opposition in this same negative light.\n\ninterventions.  This  would  limit  the  reproductive  freedoms  available  to  women  in restrictive states. Additionally, in a world where 'pregnancy' is defined as beginning at  conception,  those  who  believe  that  pregnancy  begins  at  implantation  might  be misled (by their own lights) into believing that anti-implantation interventions are abortive. Someone who is opposed to abortion, but not anti-implantation interventions  (since  she  judges  that  these  are  contraceptives)  might  be  misled  into  refusing  an  anti-implantation  intervention.  This,  in  turn,  could  lead  to  her  becoming pregnant-or carrying a pregnancy-that she would have prevented, had she been properly informed regarding how a given intervention works. So, there are risks to informed reproductive choice no matter how 'pregnancy' is defined. 13\n\nThese  risks  could  be  avoided  if  interventions  that  prevent  (or  interrupt)  pregnancy are classified, clearly, in terms of their (potential) effects on embryos. Those who object to  anti-implantation  methods-and  who  would  categorize  these  interventions as 'abortifacients'-could then make informed choices about which interventions  to  use  or  refuse.  Those  who  do  not  object  to  anti-implantation  methods would be properly informed as well. Thus, when defining 'abortion,' it seems best to avoid taking a stance on the meaning of 'pregnancy' and, instead, focus explicitly on what interventions do to embryos. For that reason, my definition will avoid the  word 'pregnancy' and will focus on interventions that harm embryos in vivo, whether implanted or not.\n\n## Prescribing should not count as performing an abortion\n\nNext, prescribing an abortifacient differs from performing an abortion. By analogy, suppose I provide poison to an assassin with the intent that he uses it to kill his target. I do not thereby assassinate the target. The assassin does. Or, if he changes his mind and discards the poison, then nobody is killed (i.e., no assassination occurs). Similarly with abortion, by providing someone with the means to perform an abortion, I do not thereby perform one. Imagine my patient never fills their prescription. If  prescribing  an  abortifacient  means  performing  an  abortion,  then  in  this  case,  I performed an abortion even though no pregnancy is terminated. That is absurd. As such, one should reject definitions of 'abortion' that state the act of prescribing an abortifacient is the same as providing an abortion. 14 Moreover, restrictive states can still maintain that prescribing abortifacients is a serious, punishable crime. In other words, just because the act is not the same as performing an abortion, that does not\n\n13 In my view, misleading someone into fatally harming an embryo seems morally worse than misleading someone into carrying a pregnancy to term. This is because wrongful killing strikes me as among the worst things that someone can do. So, on balance and with respect to public policy, there may be greater reason to favor defining 'pregnancy' as beginning at conception than at implantation. I will not defend this intuition here, however, and certainly do not expect readers to agree without further discussion.\n\n14 One reviewer adds that there may be an important difference in responsibility (or culpability) in these cases. Someone who supplies an assassin with poison may not be as responsible (or culpable) for a subsequent killing as the assassin themselves. Similarly, for someone who prescribes an abortifacient, the choice-and so, responsibility-to follow through with the act lies with the patient themselves. In that\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nmean that restrictive states must tolerate the act. Whether one opts for a restrictive or permissive policy, therefore, one's policy need not-and should not-confuse abortive acts with the enabling of abortive acts. 15\n\n## Termination (of life) must occur\n\nAbortion is best understood as an act that ends the life of an embryo or fetus. Thus, it is not just an act performed 'with the intention to terminate pregnancy.' After all, if  abortion  were  merely  an  act  done  'with  the  intention  to  terminate,'  then  there would be no meaningful distinction between abortion and attempted abortion. This is counterintuitive.\n\nMy proposed answer also clarifies that not every termination of pregnancy is an abortion. All vaginal deliveries and all cesarean sections terminate pregnancy, but they are not all abortions [58]. Saying otherwise does not remotely track ordinary language use. Nor would it track the contours of debates over abortion, since abortion opponents are not opposed to termination of pregnancy, per se. Rather, abortion opponents oppose a kind of termination-one that involves harming embryoswhile abortion proponents claim that such terminations are permissible (and should be legal). In public debate and policy, one's language should acknowledge these differences. That is, one's language should reflect the fact that abortion involves the termination of pregnancy in a certain way , so that not all terminations are counted as 'abortions.' 16\n\nOn my proposal, the death of the embryo or fetus is a necessary condition for abortion (even though it is not a sufficient condition). This claim is also supported by the fact that, colloquially, there are two kinds of 'failed' abortions: one in which pregnancy continues and one in which a fetus is 'accidentally born alive' [59, 60]. Since 'failed  abortion'  (or,  crudely,  'botched  abortion')  sometimes  refers  to  cases where fetuses are born alive, then plausibly, the death of the embryo or fetus is considered a necessary condition for abortion (in ordinary language). If so, then acting with the intention to end an embryo or fetus's life-and failing to do so-is an\n\nFootnote 14 (continued)\n\nregard,  the  prescriber  may  seem  less  responsible  than  the  patient  (where  'responsibility'  is  used  in  a causal sense, not a moral sense). If so, then there is yet another reason to distinguish between prescribing abortifacients and performing abortions.\n\n15 This suggestion may cause problems for restrictive states. Recall: abortion opponents often seek to penalize abortion providers ,  rather than patients [19-21]. From an anti-abortion perspective, if patients are not to be punished, then prescribers may look like the primary wrongdoers in cases of self-administered abortion. So, it makes sense for restrictive states to focus on trying to penalize prescribers. Still, this complication yields only a partisan reason to equate acts of prescribing abortifacients with abortive acts.  It  seems  to  me  there  is  no  good  nonpartisan,  principled  reason  to  collapse  this  distinction.  And, as  noted  above,  there  are  practical  alternatives  that  would  reduce  confusion  anyway:  laws  can  assign harsh penalties to prescribers while also clarifying how self-administered abortions will be treated. Thus, restrictive  states  can  solve  the  problems  generated  by  self-administered  abortions  without  denying  the distinction between abortion and the enabling of abortion.\n\n16 Additionally, if 'abortion' is 'the mere termination of pregnancy,' the term's meaning would become so diluted as to render it useless in public policy and debate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nattempted abortion at most. A compelling definition of 'abortion' will reflect these points.\n\n## Problems for intention-based definitions\n\nAs shown in Sect. \"Six points of disagreement in U.S. statutory law\", when defining 'abortion' in terms of intentions, states usually adopt one of two strategies. Some claim that abortion requires acting with a particular intention (e.g., an 'intention to kill' an embryo or fetus). Most states, however, claim that abortion involves termination of pregnancy with any intention other than an intention to 'produce a live birth,' 'treat an ectopic pregnancy,' etc. I worry about both approaches.\n\nIf abortion requires having a specific intention, then actions to which 'abortion' refers  seem  too  limited.  Consider  someone  who  fears  that  continued  pregnancy will  lead  to  her  unemployment.  At  7  weeks'  gestation,  she  ingests  a  prescription designed to end pregnancy abruptly. Killing an embryo may never have entered her mind. She may simply act with an intention not to be pregnant .  If,  to  count as an abortion, the agent must intend the death of the embryo (in some overt, conscious sense), then an abortion does not occur here. Neither abortion proponents nor abortion opponents should accept this implication. Abortion proponents often argue that cases like this-where continued pregnancy threatens one's job security or financial well-being-make abortion access necessary in the first place [61]. The intervention is  also  a  paradigmatic example of something that abortion opponents oppose. If a definition of 'abortion' does not capture this (paradigmatic) case, therefore, it should be rejected.\n\nIf  abortion  involves  termination  of  pregnancy  with  any  intention  ' other  than ' some specified intention(s), the above problem goes away. On these ('other than') approaches, acts of termination are considered 'abortions' until proven otherwise. Three problems arise for these approaches.\n\nFirst,  the  more  one  includes  on  lists  of  intentions  that,  if  possessed,  render  an act non-abortive, the murkier abortion policy becomes. This is especially concerning in restrictive states. Above, reports were shared of clinicians who (mistakenly) judge  that  ectopic  pregnancy  cannot  be  treated-since  it  involves  the  termination of pregnancy-even though restrictive laws usually state that acting with an intent to  treat  of  ectopic  pregnancy  does  not  constitute  an  abortion  [3,  4,  6].  Such  subtle  distinctions  and  qualifications  are  easy  to  overlook.  After  all,  on  these  ('other than')  approaches,  clinicians  must  understand  (a)  how  'abortion'  is  defined,  (b) which intentions render an act a non-abortive, and (c) any exceptions in law which allow for the performance of 'medically necessary' abortions. 17 Clinicians cannot be faulted for confusion here. The more one includes on a list of intentions that render acts 'non-abortive,' the harder it is to remember and apply them all.\n\nSecond,  the  more  one  adds  to  one's  list,  the  more  ad  hoc  one's  definition  of 'abortion'  becomes.  Principles  of  parsimony  require  that  one  avoid  complicating\n\n17 To be clear, restrictive states' laws often describe three categories of action: abortive acts, acts that are non-abortive if performed with certain intentions, and medically necessary abortions (which are abortions, but are allowed anyway).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndefinitions  unnecessarily.  If,  to  remain  plausible,  a  definition  requires  extensive qualifications-as  'other  than'  approaches  seem  to  do-then  one  wonders  if  the term is really picking out a genuine category of action.\n\nThird,  not  only  do  'other  than'  approaches  complicate  policy,  but  they  remain incomplete. To illustrate, suppose I fire a bullet at my friend's shoulder with the sole intention of preventing a mosquito from biting him. When questioned, I truthfully assert that I intended only to remove the mosquito. Pure intentions will not absolve me of wrongdoing because I  should have known better .  Beyond intentions, therefore, knowledge and circumstances are also relevant when examining one's actions. This means that, somewhat paradoxically, 'other than' approaches are both burdensome and incomplete.\n\nIn  sum,  intention-based  definitions  of  'abortion'  face  problems.  'Other  than' approaches are difficult to implement. They add complexity, perhaps in an ad hoc way,  and  invite  confusion.  They  also  fail  to  distinguish  abortions  from  non-abortive  acts  adequately.  Approaches  that  say  abortion  requires  having  some  specific intention(s), however, risk making the referent of 'abortion' unduly narrow. If a third option exists-one that avoids mention of 'intention'-that may be best. So, my proposed definition of 'abortion' will avoid any explicit mention of 'intention.'\n\n## Knowledge of death is unnecessary\n\nPerforming an abortion should not be thought to require knowledge that one will (likely) cause the death of an embryo. Such knowledge is more relevant to questions about  responsibility.  To  illustrate,  consider  three  cases.  First,  a  pregnant  woman ingests an abortifacient, knowing that it will likely cause the death of her embryo. Second, a pregnant woman ingests an abortifacient handed to her, not knowing what it is or what it will do. Third, someone slips an abortifacient into a pregnant woman's drink without her knowledge. Embryos die in all three cases. Does an abortion occur in all three cases? Plausibly so.\n\nThe first case describes a paradigmatic example of abortion. In the second case, an abortion occurs even though the agent did not ask any questions about what she was ingesting. Abortion opponents can argue 'she should have known better' than to ingest an unknown substance and so, restrictive states may find her responsible for having obtained an abortion. But her lack of knowledge does not imply that an abortion did not occur. In the third case, an abortion occurs, but given the agent's lack of knowledge, she is not responsible for it. Instead, she looks like a victim of coerced abortion [62]. If so, then agents' knowledge of potential harm is not what separates abortions from non-abortive acts, but agents' knowledge helps determine responsibility (or legal culpability) for the action performed. 18\n\nIn  restrictive  states,  people  who  perform  abortions  can  be  held responsible for  doing  so  when  there  is  a  relevant  knowledge  requirement  and  that  knowledge requirement is met. Agents may be deemed 'not responsible' when the knowledge\n\n18 'Responsibility' here is used in a causal sense, not a moral sense, so it is not synonymous with blame or guilt. If one is responsible for having performed an action, it means they are the one who performed the action; they are the primary locus from which the action arose.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nrequirement is present but not met. Whether one is responsible for an abortion, however, is a separate question from whether an abortion occurs. So, factoring into definitions of 'abortion' an agent's knowledge (or what they should know) seems like a mistake, even if assessing agents' knowledge is useful for other purposes.\n\n## Knowledge of pregnancy is unnecessary\n\nFinally,  performing  an  abortion  should  not  be  said  to  require  knowledge  of  pregnancy. If pregnancy must be known for an abortion to occur, then it is too easy to avoid  performing  an  abortion.  With  self-administered  medication,  for  example, someone who believes (but does not know ) that she is pregnant could ingest an abortifacient and subsequently claim not to have performed an abortion. Definitions with such large loopholes do not warrant widespread support.\n\nNeither should 'abortion' be restricted only to cases where pregnancy is 'clinically  diagnosable.'  This  is  because  pregnancy  is  diagnosable  around  two  weeks after conception [12]. If, by definition, actions performed prior to pregnancies being clinically diagnosable are never abortions, then any intervention that kills embryos during the first two weeks is not an abortion. The crux of the abortion debate is the treatment of embryos, however, so this definition of 'abortion' will not do. To better track public debates, interventions that harm embryos should be distinguished from those that do not. After all, interventions that kill embryos are the very thing that are in dispute, whether embryos are detectable, implanted, or not. So, a definition of 'abortion' should not apply only to 'clinically diagnosable' pregnancies.\n\nThis leaves two options. Either abortion applies only when women have 'reason to believe' they are pregnant, or knowledge of pregnancy is irrelevant to 'abortion.' Problems arise for the former option. For many women, being sexually active may provide some reason to believe that they are pregnant. If so, then under restrictive laws, many women may be unable to obtain medication (or other procedures) that threaten to harm embryos, regardless of how sure or unsure they are about being pregnant.  Abortion  proponents  will  not  accept  this  result.  Practically  speaking, they have reason to claim that abortion occurs only when pregnancy is known . That would promote access to the widest range of interventions for women who do not know whether they are pregnant. But again, one should avoid building such major loopholes into public policy. 19\n\nIt looks like problems follow if 'abortion' refers only to cases where pregnancy is  known, clinically diagnosable, or suspected. No such problems follow if definitions  of  'abortion'  make  knowledge  of  pregnancy  irrelevant.  So,  my  definition  of 'abortion' will not refer to one's knowledge of pregnancy. On my view, one may still\n\n19 Moreover,  worrisome  implications  stem  from  claiming  abortion  applies  only  to  cases  of  'known' pregnancy.  If  so,  then  women  who  want  to  evade  abortion  restrictions  are  (in  effect)  encouraged  to remain ignorant of their own health (e.g., by refusing to take pregnancy tests). This undermines one's ability  to  make informed reproductive  choices.  Failing  to  diagnose  pregnancy  in  a  timely  mannerand using certain abortifacients in ignorance-may also pose a serious risk to women with undetected ectopic pregnancies [63, p. 291]. So, even though abortion proponents have practical reasons to include strict knowledge requirements into definitions of 'abortion,' there are better reasons not to do so.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nperform (or obtain) an abortion even if pregnancy is not known, detected, detectable, or suspected.\n\n## A proposed definition of 'abortion'\n\nNo matter how one defines 'abortion,' one's definition should align with the best answers to each of the six questions considered above. What the best answers are is up for debate. I have provided some suggestions. Specifically, when defining 'abortion,' one should: avoid using the word 'pregnancy,' avoid implying that prescribing abortifacients is equivalent to performing an abortion, specify that termination actually occurs, avoid language of 'intention' (if possible), and avoid requiring that providers know either that their acts will (likely) harm embryos or that their patients are pregnant. To effectively track public debates, one should also ensure that one's definition of 'abortion' captures all and only types of acts that are in dispute (insofar as is possible).\n\nHere is one definition that comes close to accomplishing all of this. Where ' e ' refers to a zygote, embryo, or fetus in vivo:\n\nAbortion = An  act  that,  via  medicinal  or  surgical  intervention,  secures  the death of e without regard for e 's survival.\n\nIn closing, I will unpack this definition, consider one major objection to it, and outline several ways in which it may facilitate development of clear policy.\n\n## Unpacking the definition\n\nFirst, abortion is an act. It is not something that occurs naturally or randomly but is something that is done. 20 Moreover, abortion is a specific kind of act: it involves either some 'medicinal intervention' or 'surgical intervention.' The former includes medications like methotrexate, homeopathic methods, etc. The latter includes things\n\n20 ' Abortion,' so defined, will not refer to many phenomena-such as naturally-occurring fetal demisethat are sometimes referred to by terms like 'miscarriage' or 'spontaneous abortion.' Readers who accept medical definitions of 'abortion' that do refer  to  naturally-occurring fetal demise as a kind of abortion may be unhappy with this implication. In response, it was demonstrated (above) that not all 'medical definitions' of 'abortion' refer to naturally-occurring fetal demise in the first place (see, especially, footnote 10). The medical community (and others) must decide whether to define 'abortion' in a way that refers to things like naturally-occurring fetal demise. As one considers how best to make this decision, it will be important to weigh the reasons for different proposals. There are clear advantages to distinguishing between 'abortion' and 'miscarriage' in public policy. First, under the proposed definition, abortion restrictions would not prevent clinicians from providing miscarriage-related care. Second, some data suggest that using language other than 'spontaneous abortion' to describe naturally-occurring fetal demise is favored by the vast majority of women [58, p. 278 n.3]. In addition to respecting many women's linguistic preferences, rejecting the phrase 'spontaneous abortion' may also go some distance in reducing the 'misplaced guilt' and 'disenfranchised grief' that is commonly experienced by bereaved parents [58, pp. 274-277]. Third, insofar as a definition of 'abortion' should track all and only phenomena that are contentious in public debates, one should exclude naturally-occurring fetal demise from counting as a kind of abortion. After all, while naturally-occurring fetal demise may be regarded as tragic by abortion opponents and abortion proponents alike, it is not subject to the same kind of widespread debate as practices\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nlike  dilation  and  curettage  (D&amp;C), dilation and evacuation (D&amp;E), and so on. By specifying that abortion involves either a medicinal or surgical intervention, it follows that not every act  of  securing an embryo's death counts as an abortion. This part of the definition serves as a corrective to those who define 'abortion' simply as  'feticide,'  the  'the  intentional  or  unjust  taking  of  pre-natal  human  life,'  or  'the wrongful  killing'  of  an  embryo  or  fetus,  as  anti-abortion  philosophers  often  do [64-66].\n\nTo see why, imagine that a terrorist bombs a hospital, with an intent to kill everyone  inside  (including  several  pregnant  women  and  their  fetuses).  Suppose  that, regrettably, the terrorist succeeds. This event includes several acts of intentional feticide.  But  it  seems  wrong  to  say  that  the  terrorist  'performed  an  abortion'  on  the fetuses he killed. If correct, then there are cases of intentional feticide (or 'wrongful killing' of fetuses) that do not count as abortions. My proposed definition respects this  distinction.  Accounts  that  define  'abortion'  as  things  like  'feticide'  or  'intentional feticide' do not [64-66].\n\nRelatedly, the definition does not invoke the 'killing/letting die' distinction (e.g., by defining 'abortion' as a form of killing). There are two reasons for this. First, scholarly debates over the killing/letting die distinction are complicated [67]. If it is possible to avoid getting into the weeds of such discussions-and if one can remain neutral on the nature of the distinction-then so much the better. After all, if one can remain neutral on the distinction, then one need not take on board contentious metaphysical commitments when advancing or applying the definition. Second, by saying that abortion 'secures the death of e ,' it remains possible that death may be secured via an act of killing or via an act of 'letting die.' This allows for the possibility that 'disconnect abortions' are genuine abortions, where one may ''merely' disconnect the fetus, letting it die.' [68, p. 562] In other words, performance of a hysterotomy or hysterectomy may still count as an abortion in some cases, even supposing that a fetus is not killed directly. 21 The definition also avoids the word 'pregnancy' and instead, focuses on acts that are harmful to embryos or fetuses (henceforth, 'embryos') in vivo. It thereby bypasses debates over when pregnancy begins and maintains a focus on the crux of the abortion debate: how embryos are treated. The definition also implies that merely prescribing an abortifacient does not count as performing an abortion. Prescribing a drug does not secure the death of e , even if prescriptions enable someone to secure the death of e . Thus, one can distinguish between abortion and the enabling of abortion. And, by stating that the act 'secures the  death  of e ,'  the  definition  is  unambiguous:  abortion  results  in  fetal  demise. Should e survive an intervention, therefore, the act is an abortion attempt (at most).\n\nThe final portion of the definition specifies that abortion involves acting 'without regard for e 's survival.' This is the closest I come to building intention into my definition. Yet, the definition is not as narrow as those that require a specific intention be  present  (as  in  definitions  that  say  abortion  only  occurs  when  one  'intends  the death of the fetus'). Nor is the definition an 'other than' approach, since it does not\n\nFootnote 20 (continued)\n\ncaptured by my proposed definition of 'abortion.'.\n\n21 I will have much more to say about hysterotomies and hysterectomies below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nlist  intentions  that  would  preclude  one's  action  from  counting  as  an  abortion.  So, I  avoid  advancing either of the two kinds of intention-based definitions discussed above and, therefore, avoid problems facing both.\n\nStill, intention is relevant to the definition indirectly. When saying that abortion is an act performed 'without regard for e 's survival,' this includes acts of feticide that are performed with the intent, purpose, or desire to secure e 's death. By intentionally killing e , one shows a lack of regard for e 's survival. But the definition goes beyond those cases and includes some acts of feticide that are accompanied by indifference to e 's survival. This means that abortion may occur even if one is not consciously intending (or desiring) the death of e .\n\nOne may worry that it seems difficult to establish whether someone acts 'without regard for e 's survival.' When it comes to establishing this fact, however, precedent in law is readily available. Involuntary manslaughter, for example, is a form of 'homicide that results from a reckless or negligent act that the actor commenced without  any  intent  to  cause  death'  [69].  This  category  of  action  sets  intention aside-as my definition does-and considers whether the agent acts in a 'reckless' way.  'Recklessness,'  moreover,  occurs  when  a  person  creates  'significant  risk  of harm to others' and is 'either aware of the risk and makes no effort to abate it or who is indifferent to the risk' [70]. These are standards already available, therefore, to help establish when someone acts without regard for the life of another being. 22 This is not to say that people who obtain abortions act recklessly or commit manslaughter. Rather, the point is that there are clear, conceptual precedents in law that can help to establish whether someone acts 'without regard' for another being's survival. My definition does not make matters unduly opaque, therefore, since it is possible to determine whether someone acts 'without regard' for e 's survival.\n\nFinally, acts that directly and intentionally kill embryos-which I consider to be paradigmatic instances of abortion-will count as abortions on this definition. Many interventions directly disrupt e 's bodily integrity in lethal ways, as in cases of suction, dilation and curettage (D&amp;C), dilation and evacuation (D&amp;E), lethal injections of potassium chloride into the heart, 'partial-birth' abortion, and so forth. It would be absurd for a provider to claim that they are acting 'with regard' for e 's survival by fatally disabling e ,  dismembering e ,  or  injecting e with  a  lethal  substance.  So, employing those interventions will count as performing an abortion (assuming that e dies, that is). This means that-in addition to aligning with my suggested answers to the six questions-the proposed definition also refers to (many) paradigmatic cases of 'abortion.' Still, one may worry that the definition does not capture every paradigmatic case, as we shall now see.\n\n## An objection: previable hysterotomies and hysterectomies\n\nHere is a potential problem for my definition. Consider two ways of ending previable pregnancies: via hysterotomy and via hysterectomy. For simplicity, let them be understood as follows:\n\n22 'Being' because e is a human organism-an individual member of the species, Homo sapiens -which is not to say or imply that e is a person, legally or otherwise.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHysterotomy: A previable fetus is developing in utero, the uterus is surgically opened,  and  the  fetus  is  removed  from  the  mother's  body,  fully  intact.  The fetus dies [71].\n\nHysterectomy: A previable fetus is developing in utero and the entire uterus (including the fetus) is removed, fully intact. The fetus dies [72].\n\nOne might argue that whether a hysterectomy or hysterotomy is performed prior to viability, both should count as an abortion. If either procedure is implied by my definition not to be an abortion, then that is a problem. 23\n\nIn  response,  my  definition  implies  that  some  hysterotomies  and  hysterectomies will count as abortions, but not all of them will. Hysterotomies and hysterectomies performed without regard for e's survival will count. Someone who obtains a hysterectomy, for example, with the intent that e dies  would  be  seeking  an  abortion. The same applies to someone who opts for a hysterotomy following an adverse prenatal diagnosis. For example, suppose that at 10 weeks' gestation, a fetus is found to have a condition that will likely lead to their death during the first few years of their life. Subsequently, the mother obtains a hysterotomy or induced delivery at that stage. This act would count as an abortion under my definition because the act is performed without regard for e 's survival . Of course, one may argue that the act is permissible, merciful, or performed for the fetus's benefit, insofar as it spares the fetus  and  family  some  degree  of  suffering.  But  questions  of  what  is  permissible, merciful, or beneficial remain separate from the question of whether an act counts as an abortion.\n\nIn contrast to these cases, suppose that a patient with advanced uterine cancer, who desperately wishes that her 12-week-old fetus survives, must undergo a hysterotomy to save her own life. Her fetus has no chance at survival at 12 weeks' gestation.  Still,  it  is  possible  for  the  patient  and  provider  to  act  with  real  regard  for e 's  survival.  The  patient  might  truthfully  state  that  were  there any way  to  save e , she would pursue it. This would be compelling evidence that she is, indeed, sufficiently concerned for e 's survival. Under those circumstances, even though this is a form of previable delivery, my definition would not label it an 'abortion' (at least not obviously). 24\n\nThis claim may seem absurd. Surely a hysterotomy, when performed at 12 weeks' gestation,  is  either  an  abortion  in  all  cases  or  an  abortion  in  none  of  them.  I  am not convinced. By comparison, consider a case in which one surgeon severs their patient's  artery  as  part  of  routine  heart  transplant.  Meanwhile,  another  surgeon severs their own patient's artery-the same artery, with the same type of blade, at the same rate, etc.-and lets the patient bleed to death. Did both surgeons perform the  same  action ?  Yes  and  no.  Mechanically,  both  did  the  same  thing.  They  both applied a blade to an artery and severed it. Stopping there would leave us with an\n\n23 I am grateful to an anonymous reviewer for raising this point.\n\n24 Similarly, suppose that a previable fetus is irretrievably dying. Induced delivery-or a hysterotomy or hysterectomy-would not obviously count as an abortion under those circumstances. I will unpack this point below, when describing cases in which allowing someone to die can be consistent with maintaining a real regard for their survival.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nimpoverished description of their respective actions, however. That is because the mechanics and tools involved do not tell the whole story. One surgeon engaged in an act of killing, the other did not. A complete description of the surgeons' respective actions, therefore, will explain why the actions are importantly different.\n\nMy definition of 'abortion'  does  not  focus  exclusively  on  the  mechanics  of  an action, nor the tools involved. Hence, some previable hysterotomies (or hysterectomies) may count as abortions, while others may not, even if the same mechanical process occurs across cases. 25 By moving beyond mechanics and tools, my definition is pragmatically useful in ways that other definitions-especially the 'medical' definitions listed in Sect. 3-are not. My definition is designed to track the contours of the abortion debate. Above, I argued that when defining 'abortion' for the purpose of public policy (in a polarized society), the definition should refer to all and only the kinds of acts that are in dispute. Abortion opponents do not typically object to various forms of previable delivery when the mother's life is in jeopardy (at least when e is not directly and intentionally killed). [73, p. 233]. So, they generally will not oppose a hysterotomy in the case described above. If those kinds of cases are not captured by 'abortion,' therefore, then relevant interventions may be performed without providers running afoul of abortion restrictions. 26\n\nTo add some further subtlety, a mother who opts for a hysterotomy (or hysterectomy)  may  reasonably  be  said  to  have  sufficient  regard  for e 's  survival  if  the reason she seeks the procedure is to save her life. A hysterotomy, in such a case, likely  would  not  count  as  an  abortion.  By  contrast,  someone  who  opts  for  a  hysterotomy  simply  because  she  wishes  not  to  be  pregnant-or,  to  use  Thomson's example,  because  she  wants  to  go  on  vacation  [74,  pp.  65-66]-exhibits  a lack\n\n25 One could argue that, clinically speaking, mechanics and tools are all that matter when individuating between actions. This claim rests upon metaphysical assumptions about action individuation. A philosophical defense (rather than a 'medical' or 'scientific' defense) would be needed for that view.\n\n26 There is much to say about distinctions between direct killing, indirect killing, and 'letting die' here. Some authors argue that a hysterotomy (or induced delivery prior to viability) involves the indirect killing of e [75, p. 114]. Others claim that these acts are not a form of killing but, instead, are merely a 'letting die' [68]. I need not take a stance here. As I have framed things, if someone directly and intentionally kills e , then they cannot claim to be acting with a real regard for e 's survival. Procedures that directly and intentional kill e , therefore, will count as abortions on my definition. That said, below, I argue that letting e die does not always imply that one acts without regard for e 's survival. By the same token, certain acts of indirect killing also seem compatible with maintaining an adequate regard for e 's survival. So, whether one thinks that previable delivery involves an indirect killing or merely a 'letting die,' there will be some cases in which the acts do not count as abortions on my definition. Lastly, suppose that someone believes that hysterotomies, hysterectomies, and previable deliveries do involve  a  direct  killing of e (in  some cases at least) [39, p. 73]. Can someone directly kill e (albeit unintentionally )  while claiming to act with a real regard for e 's survival? Certainly. Suppose, for example, that a fetus's survival depends upon her receiving open-heart surgery. Yet, when performing the surgery, the surgeon nicks an artery which results in the fetus's death. The surgeon directly kills the fetus in this case, albeit unintentionally. But the surgeon was also acting with a real regard for e 's survival. In fact, she was trying to save e's life.  Thus, not every act of directly killing e will count as an abortion on my definition. That is, in principle, some unintentional, direct killings of e are non-abortive actions. Alternatively, if one wishes to argue that every hysterotomy, hysterectomy, and previable delivery involves the intentional, direct killing of e , then of course, all such acts count as abortions. But, like many other scholars and professionals, I do not find this view plausible. [38, 40] Toni Saad, for example, argues that even in extreme cases where\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof regard for e 's survival. A hysterotomy in that case would count as an abortion. Thus, my definition counts some previable deliveries as 'abortions,' while others do not count. Given my aim-to provide a simple definition that refers to all and only disputed cases, insofar as is possible-this is an advantage of the definition, not a disadvantage.\n\nLastly, one may ask: where is the line when determining that someone acts 'without  regard'  for  the  life  of  another?  Abortion  opponents  will  likely  set  a  high  bar, using other cases as a guide. They may ask: under what circumstances might a parent justifiably allow their born child to die? Perhaps only to save another life (including the parent's own life) or when their child is already dying. A parent would fail to show (sufficient) regard for the life of his born child, however, if he allowed his child to die so that he might go on vacation, avoid financial hardship, keep his job, save his marriage, and so forth. Hysterotomies or hysterectomies performed on previable fetuses for those sorts of reasons, therefore, seemingly involve acting without regard for e 's survival (and so, would count as 'abortions' and would be subject to abortion restrictions). Interventions performed to save the mother's life, however, would not obviously suggest a lack of regard for e 's survival and so, need not count as 'abortions' under my definition. Hysterotomies and hysterectomies performed to save the mother's life, therefore, would not be subject to abortion restrictions, even when performed prior to fetal viability.\n\nOne may continue to wonder: how can someone act 'with regard for e 's survival' when ending pregnancy prior to viability via hysterectomy, hysterotomy, or induced delivery? It may seem that if one knows that their action will indirectly result in e 's death, then in principle, the act cannot be  performed with any real regard for e 's survival. In response, I have argued that the reasons one has for ending a previable pregnancy shape the nature of the action itself. Opting for previable delivery so that one can go on vacation illustrates a lack of concern-a lack of regard-for e 's survival. A person who adequately cares about e 's survival will not act in this way. So, under those circumstances, if one were really concerned about e 's survival, then one would not opt for delivery at that stage. By contrast, if continued pregnancy were highly likely to result in one's own death, then previable delivery may be performed without implying that one lacks regard for e 's survival. An analogy will be helpful here.\n\nSuppose that my neighbor is trapped in a burning building, and I recognize that any attempt to save them will very likely result in my death. It seems to me that, morally and legally speaking, I have no obligation to attempt to rescue them. My\n\nFootnote 26 (continued)\n\na mother's life is at risk, 'ending a pregnancy with feticidal intention is never necessary' [76, p. 247]. If  so,  then  whether  saving  the  mother's  life  requires  direct  unintentional  killing,  indirect  unintentional killing, or merely letting e die, it remains possible, on my definition, that the intervention will not count as an abortion. Critically, the question of whether an act is a direct killing or not is of secondary importance anyway. What is of primary importance, in this context, is determining whether an act is performed without regard for e 's survival. If the act-be it a killing or letting die-secures the death of e and is performed without regard for e 's survival, then it is an abortion.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nrefusal to attempt a rescue, moreover, does not imply that I have any disregard for their survival. Rather, ensuring my own survival is a strong enough reason to justify my refusal to attempt a rescue. By contrast, suppose that I see a toddler drowning and refuse to rescue them, simply because I do not want to dampen my shoes. Such an action would demonstrate an inadequate regard for the toddler's survival. Someone who cares about the toddler's survival would not act in this way.\n\nThe key point is that allowing a subject to die does not, by itself, imply a lack of regard for the subject's survival. It will have this implication in some cases, but not all cases. 27 Similarly, recall that not every act of killing or letting die counts as manslaughter, legally speaking. Rather, causing death, whether directly or indirectly, may be regarded as manslaughter only when done in a 'reckless or negligent' way [69]. So, on my proposal, when a hysterectomy, hysterotomy, or induced delivery is performed prior to viability, the action may count as an abortion, but will not always count as an abortion. 28 The difference is whether one acts with regard for e 's survival, where adequate regard for e 's survival means having a willingness to secure e 's death only under the most dire of circumstances. 29\n\n## Putting the definition to work\n\nFinally, here are some ways in which the proposed definition provides a basis for clarity. ' Abortion,' so defined, does not apply to removal of fetal remains under any circumstance. Suppose, for example, that a D&amp;C is used to remove fetal remains. A D&amp;C may be mechanically the same whether it is performed on a living fetus or on a dead fetus. The tools, motions, etc., may be comparable. On my definition of 'abortion' though, a D&amp;C performed on fetal remains cannot be considered an abortion, since one cannot 'secure the death of e ' if e is  already dead. Thus, providers may rest assured that when they remove fetal remains-by any method-they would not run afoul of abortion restrictions.\n\nTreatment (e.g., chemotherapy) of the mother for some disease or illness need not count as an abortion either, especially if treatment is required to save the mother's\n\n27 I would say the same thing even if one regards previable delivery (or a hysterotomy or hysterectomy) as an indirect killing: under certain circumstances, indirect killing will not count as an abortion, because it is possible to perform the action while maintaining one's regard for e 's survival.\n\n28 What about a case in which a pregnant woman is completely indifferent to e 's  survival  but,  it  just so happens, a hysterotomy must be performed at 12 weeks' gestation to save the mother's life? Strictly speaking, my definition might regard this act as an abortion. In practice, abortion restrictions would not preclude the action, however. This is because ending pregnancy in those circumstances is consistent with adequate regard for e 's survival. From the standpoint of public policy, if someone acts in a way that is consistent with adequate regard for e 's survival, then the act may be counted as a 'non-abortion.' In other words, if it were established that a subject opted for induced delivery prior to viability in a case where she would die were pregnancy to continue, the state might reasonably regard the act as a non-abortion (since the action is fully consistent with what someone who has sufficient regard for e 's survival would do).\n\n29 I am grateful to Cody Feikles for pushing me on these points.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nlife. 30 Pursuing  such  treatment  does  not  imply  that  one  lacks  sufficient  regard  for e 's survival. To be clear, under consideration are interventions that do not involve any direct, intentional, or purposeful destruction of e (since those acts would demonstrate a lack of regard for e 's survival). Rather, treating the mother for some lifethreatening  condition-where  treatment  may  have  a  negative  side  effect  on e -is more akin to hysterotomies (or hysterectomies) performed to save the mother's life (discussed above). So, on the proposed definition, abortion restrictions would not preclude the use of treatments, like chemotherapy, that aim to save the mother's life even though they might also (inadvertently) cause fetal death.\n\nRegarding treatments for ectopic pregnancy, the discussion will resemble what was said about hysterotomies and hysterectomies. Some interventions will count as abortions, while others may not. Specifically, there are two classes of interventions to consider: medication interventions and surgical interventions. Regarding medication interventions, different medications work differently. If Cara Buskmiller is correct, then mifepristone merely detaches embryos from their mothers' bodies [26]. If so, then mifepristone need not count as performing an abortion in some cases. To determine that, one would need to consider whether the agent possesses sufficient regard for e 's  survival  to  preclude  the  act  from  counting  as  an  abortion.  If  one  is using the drug-and allowing e to  die-for  most  reasons  (e.g.,  financial  security, lack of social support, etc.), the act likely displays a lack of regard for e 's survival. So, mifepristone use is likely to count as abortive in most cases.\n\nAlternatively,  Hershenov  argues  that  mifepristone does directly  harm  embryos, rather  than  merely  detaching  them  (and  allowing  them  to  die)  [77].  If  so,  then using  mifepristone  would  count  as  performing  an  abortion.  Again,  it  seems  difficult to maintain that one acts with regard for e 's survival while one is actively and directly destroying e . So, determining whether mifepristone is abortive requires, to some extent, understanding how it works. This is not a shortcoming of the proposed definition though. The definition will tell what is (or is not) an abortion after establishing the facts regarding how particular interventions work. If Buskmiller is right, then the definition will not automatically label mifepristone use as 'abortive,' though many cases of its use will be abortive. If Hershenov is right, then the definition will label  mifepristone  use  as  abortive.  Either  way,  the  definition  will  provide  a  clear verdict once the empirical dispute is settled. Other medications are less equivocal than mifepristone. Methotrexate has deadly effects on embryos; it secures the death of embryo by acting on them directly [26, 77]. If actively ending e 's life is incompatible with possessing sufficient regard for e 's survival, then methotrexate use will be defined as 'abortive,' even when applied to ectopic pregnancies.\n\nRegarding  surgical  interventions  for  ectopic  pregnancy  (e.g.,  salpingostomy  or salpingectomy),  the  proposed  definition  does  not  necessarily  apply  to  these  treatments. What matters is one's regard (or lack thereof) for e 's  survival.  If  a  salpingostomy or salpingectomy is performed to save the mother's life, then-as I have\n\n30 Obviously, the mother's survival is a necessary condition for e 's  survival  prior  to  viability.  Even  if attempts to save the mother's life risk some serious, indirect harm to e ,  therefore,  the  act  may  still  be performed with regard for e 's survival. The act, after all, aims to actualize one of the conditions required for e 's survival.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nargued-this  seems  compatible  with  possessing  sufficient  regard  for e 's  survival. Thus, abortion restrictions would not prevent access to surgical treatment of ectopic pregnancy. And, if Miller is correct, then since medication is generally not an appropriate  treatment  for  ectopic  pregnancy  anyway,  this  means  that  the  best  treatment options  remain  fully  (and  clearly)  accessible  under  the  proposed  definition,  even where abortion is banned outright [63].\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn  this  essay,  I  have  identified  six  major  questions  that  must  be  answered  when defining 'abortion.' As is, there is no consistent, canonical definition of 'abortion' in law nor in medicine. For this reason, I have argued that legal, medical, and academic domains would benefit from a rigorous discussion of these six questions and the meaning of 'abortion.' I have also suggested answers to each of the six questions that seem most reasonable for the purpose of crafting public policy in a polarized society. I ended by proposing a definition of 'abortion' that squares with these suggestions and tracks the contours of public debates over abortion.\n\nWhether  my  suggestions  and  definition  are  accepted  is  (much)  less  important than the framework created here. By identifying the major ways in which there is disagreement over the meaning of 'abortion' (and related terms) one can begin to clarify public debate, policy, and clinical practice. Failure to clarify these matters means that confusion over abortion may persist. Confusion risks the health and lives of many pregnant women. Whether one is an abortion proponent or opponent, this is unacceptable. Parties on both sides have compelling reason to provide clarity on abortion and so, compelling reason to provide answers to the questions that I have raised. 31\n\n## Appendix\n\nThe following statutes were referenced when generating the tables in this article.\n\n- Alabama Code 26-21-2. 2024.\n- Alabama Code 26-22-2. 2024.\n- Alabama Code 26-23B-3. 2024.\n- Alabama Code 26-23D-1. 2024.\n- Alabama Code 26-23E-3. 2024.\n- Alabama Code 26-23I-2. 2024.\n- Alaska Stat. 18.16.090. 2024.\n- Alaska Stat. 18.50.950. 2024.\n\n31 Many people provided feedback during the drafting of this essay.
