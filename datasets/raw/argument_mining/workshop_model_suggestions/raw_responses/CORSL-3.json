To illu st ratesome of th e main relationship s betw een first-order logic and second-ord er logic , this paper introdu ces basic logi c, a kind of zero› orderlogic,whichis morerudim entary than first-ord er andwhichis transc ended by first-order in th e same way that first-order is transc ended by second-order . The heuristic effectiv eness and th e historical importan ce of second-order logic are reviewedin thecont ext of thecontemporary debat e over th e l egitimacyof second-order logic . Rejectionof second-order logi c is viewed as inv olvingradical repudiation of partof ourscientific tradition . Buteven if genuin e logi c comes to be regardedas excluding second-order r easoning , which is a rea l possibility , its effectiv eness as a h euri sti c instrum entwillrema in and its import an cefor under› standingthehistoryof logicand m ath ematicswillnotbe diminished. Sec ond› order logi c may some day be gone, but it will n ever be forg ott en. Technical formali sms ha ve been avoidedentirely in an effort to reachan interdi sciplinary audienc e, butevery eff orthas been made to lim it th e inevitabl e sacrifi ce of rigor.\n\nNo matter whathumanaction you consider,if everyone does it to everyone doing it to them , theneveryone has it done to them by ev eryon e to whom theydo it . For example , if everyoneteacheseveryonewho t eachesthem , theneveryone is taught by everyone theyteach.Likewise , if everyone helps everyone who helps them , then everyone is helpedby everyone theyhelp. The same holds for \"encourages\" , \"hinders\",\"supports\",\"opposes\", \"ignores\", andtherest.\n\nEach of theabovepropositions is actually a tautology, a proposition implied by its own negation . In fact, each of themcan be proved to be true by logical reasoning alone; e .g., by deducingthem from theirown negations. Since everypropositionin thesame form as atautology is againa tautology , a discourseformally similarto that expressedaboveobtainsin every universe ofdiscourse,notjustin theuniverse ofhumans.\n\nIn metalogic, forexample , we often discuss the universe ofpropositions in so far as various logical relations areconcerned . By a logical relation I mean relations such asimplication , consequence , contradiction , compatibility , in › dependence,etc . Morespecifically , I mean whatare called binaryrelations on theuniverse of propositions. If R indicates such arelation and if a and b are each individual propositions , then aRb canbe used toexpressthepropo-\n\n- C. Anthony Anderson and M. Zeleny (eds.), Logic. Meaning and Computation, 61-75.\n\nsitionthat thefirstproposition a is related by R to the second proposition b. It is notexcluded, of course,that a and b arethesame proposition.For example , everyproposition implies itself andsome butnoteveryproposition contradicts itself.\n\nNowlogical relations arecertainly notactions . Saccheri 's Postulate contra› dicts theParallel Postulate butthere is no action that Saccheri 's Postulate couldperform. Nevertheless , as we havejustseen, relation verbs function grammatically in certain contexts in a mannersimilartothefunction of ac­ tion verbs. The relation verbssignificant in theuniverse of humansinclude thefollowing: outweighs, outlives, succeeds (in several senses), precedes (in several senses), equals (in many senses), and many others . Theaction verbs significant in theuniverse of humansinclude the following: calls (in atleast one sense) , serves (inatleastone sense), teaches,commands, obeys, and many others .\n\nIn normalEnglishsome of thelogical relations areexpressedby relation verbs, as we have seen. For example, implication is expressedby 'implies' and contradiction is expressedby 'contradicts'. However, some of themare expressedby relation nouns. Forexample , consequence is expressedby the relation noun'consequence'.The law of transitivity of consequence is that everyconsequence of aconsequence of aproposition is againa consequence of that proposition . Moreover,there are logical relations expressedby relation adjectives. Compatibility and independence are expressedby 'compatible' and 'independent'.Aristotle 's fundamental law of compatibility of truth is that every two true propositions arecompatible with each other . Using 'inde› pendent ' in themost widely accepted sense we can say that everyproposition which isindependent of a given proposition is neither implied by nor contra› dictedby the given proposition , and conversely , everypropositionwhich is neither implied by nor contradicted by a givenproposition is independent of the given proposition.\n\nOne reasonfor reviewing the various ways that logical relations are ex› pressed inEnglish is topointoutwhatall creative writers already know, viz . that knowledge of the conventional rules of English shouldenhance butnot inhibitEnglishwriting. For example,my very first sentence uses the plu› ralpronoun'them ' as coreferential with'everyone', which issingular . Even worse, fromthepointof view ofconventional rules, is my use of thefiller 'you consider'.The proposition being expressedis not aprediction of what will happen if you consider something.The proposition is notabout you per se atall.Thesentence expressesa general proposition predicating a certain complexproperty of every action on the universe of humans . Thephrase'no matter whathumanaction youconsider'is justa heuristically effective way ofexpressing a universal quantifier . From a logical pointof view the following would do justas well : ' everyhumanaction is one suchthat ' , 'everyhuman action is one where ', 'with every humanaction' , etc . At anyrate, a sentence that violates the conventional rules of English applicable to th e expression\n\nof a givenproposition is sometimes nevertheless a perfectly acceptable and effective way of expressingthat veryproposition .\n\nWhether a sentence is an acceptable and effective expressionof a given proposition is a matter of howreaders take it, andnot a matter ofconventions established in thepast . Now wearereadyto presenta discourseobtaining in theuniverse of propositions andformally similarto theone whichbegan thisessay .\n\nNo matter whatlogical relation you consider,if every given proposition bearsit to ev ery proposition bearing it tothegiven proposition,then ev› ery givenproposition is borneit by every proposition thegiven proposition bearsit to . For example , if everyproposition contradicts everyproposition contradicting it, theneveryproposition is contradicted by everyproposition it contradicts . Likewise , if everypropositionimplies everyproposition im› plying it,theneverypropositionis implied by everypropositionit implies. Thesame holds for \"is a consequence of', \"is compatible with\" , \"is logically equivalent to\", \"is independent of', \"is a contradictory oppositeof', and the rest.\n\nThepropositions expressedin theaboveparagraph areall tautologies and theyare all laws of logic. Thepropositions in thefirstparagraph ofthisessay are all tautologies butnone ofthemare laws of logic becausetheyare not abouta logical subject-matter . The proposition\"Everyproposition implies everyproposition implyingit\" isabouta logical subject-matter butit is not a law of logic becauseit is false . For example, \"Everypropositionis true\" implies \"Everyfalse proposition is true\" , butnot conversely. Theproposition \"Everypropositioncontradicts everypropositioncont radicting it\" is a law of logic, of course,butit is not a tautology becauseit is inthesame form as a propositionconsidered justabove and found to be false . By a law of logic Imean a truepropositionabouta logical subject -matter , e.g., about propositions, aboutarguments, aboutargumentations , etc .\n\nThetwoproperties, being tautologous andbeing a law of logic , are orthog­ onal in thesensethat each of thefourcombinations ofthetwo is exemplified . We have seen above that some butnoteverytautology is a law of logic and that some butnoteverynon-tautology is a law of logic. There is much con› fusionconcerning thiselementary point. Some butnotall of theconfusion is more or less deliberately nurtured in theserviceofvarious dogmas which, happily,are waning in popularity.\n\nThe proposition,\"Everypropositioncontradicts every proposition con› tradicting it\", is thelaw of symmetry(or reciprocity) of contradiction and \"Some propositionimplies some propositionnot implying it in return\" is thelaw of non -symmetry(or non-reciprocity) ofimplication . \"No contradic › toryoppositeof acontradictory oppositeof aproposition is a contradictory oppositeof that proposition\"is the law of anti transitivity of contradictory opposition . A contradictory opposite of apropositionis, of course, a propo› sitionlogically equivalent to thenegation of that proposition.For example,\n\n\"Some true proposition is nottautologous\" and \"Not every trueproposition is tautologous\" arebothcontradictory oppositesof \"Everytrueproposition is tautologous\". In order to avoid confusion it should be noted that, although every two propositions that arecontradictory oppositesof each other contra› dicteachother,not every two propositionsthat contradict eachotherare contradictory opposites . To takean extremeexample, \"No proposition im› plies itself'contradicts \"Some propositionimplies everyproposition\".The sameexampleillustrates another pointthat clarifies things and helps to avoid confusion, viz . that although no trueproposition contradicts a true propo› sition,some falsepropositionscontradict falsepropositions . In fact , some falsepropositions contradict themselves . Thusalthough no two contradict› ing propositions arebothtrue , some twocontradicting propositions areboth false. In such cases, i .e., when two contradicting propositions arebothfalse , theyare not contradictory oppositesbecauseevery two contradictory oppo› siteshave different truth-values.\n\nA contmdiction (or a self -contradiction) is a proposition that contradicts itself, i.e ., that implies its ownnegation.Every contradiction is a contra › dictory opposite of a tautology and everytautology is a contradictory op› positeof acontradiction. A proposition is said to be contmdictory (or self› contradictory) if it is acontradiction. Everytwocontradictory propositions contradict eachotherbutno twocontradictory propositionsare contradic› toryopposites of eachother. The expression'two contradictory proposi› tions'means \"twopropositions each of which is self-contradictory\" whereas 'twocontradict ing propositions' means \"twopropositions contradicting each other\"which, in view of the symmetrical nature of \"contradicts \", amounts to \"two propositions one of which contradicts theother\".\n\nIn ordinary technical English,'is contrary to' and 'is a contrary to' are ambiguous. Sometimes, \"contradicts\" is meantandsometimes \"is a contra› dictoryoppositeof' is meant . Surprisingly, the ambiguitydoes not seem to betroublesome. However, in former times logicians had attached a third technical meaningthat did lead to confusion . Two propositions were said to be contraries (sc of each other) if theycontradict eachother butth eir nega› tionsdo notcontradict eachother . For example , \"Everynumberis prime\" and \"Everynumberis non -prime\" arecontraries . It is easy to prove that every two contradicting propositions that arenotcontradictory oppositesare contraries, andvice versa . In modernlogic,'contrary' is rarely used inthe obsolete technical sense.\n\nWe have had occasion justnow tostate several laws of logic and to men› tion(or talk about)several laws of logic . As indicated above , by a law of logic I mean atrue proposition abouta logical subject-matter (propositions, arguments, argumentations, etc .). The most basic laws of logic are thelaws of excluded middle, non-contradiction , andtruth andconsequence : \"Every proposition is either true or false\", \"No propositionis bothtrue andfalse \" and\"Everyproposition implied by atrue proposition is true\".\n\nThelaws of logic, in fact all propositions aboutlogical subject -matter are in some sense second-level (or meta-level) propositions in thesensethat they areaboutthingsthat arethemselves aboutthings(usually , of course, non› logical things) . Some people , either ignorant of or inoppositionto logical tradit ion, call such propositions'second-order' .This is not how ' second› order'is used in this essay although some second-level propositions are also second-order . A propositionis classified as basic, first-order, second-order, etc ., not on the basis of whatit isaboutbutrather on thebasis of its logical structure . Thevery first proposition of this essay is second-order . Thesecond propositionis first-order.Everypropositionto the effect that one named proposition is in a mentionedlogical relation to another named proposition is basic, e .g., \"Saccheri'sPostulate contradicts the Parallel Postula te\". It will become obvious that thetwoproperties,being second-level and being second-order, areorthogonal.\n\nThe basic propositions, veryroughly speaking , are those without common nouns. It is perhapseasiest to describethe basic propositions of arithmetic (BPA). Actually, instead of describingthe BPA outright, it isconvenient to describethe basic sentences of arithmetic (BSA) andthento saythat the ba› sic propositions ofarithmetic arethepropositions expressedby th e basic sen› tenceswhenthesentences areunderstood in theirintended interpretations . Now, thesubstantives of thebasic sentences of arithmetic are exclusiv ely numerals (number-names)in thewide sense : 'zero','one', 'two' , 'three', ... , 'zeroplusone', 'zero plus two',. .. , 'two plus (zero times one)', . ... Among thenumerals I alsointend : 'two-squared', 'two-cub ed', etc . The atomic sen› tencesof arithmetic include, in thefirst place , all so-called equations : 'one plus one is two', 'one plus two is one',etc. , in other words any sentence in the pattern numeral is numeral. The 'is' here, of course, is ntended toexpress numerical identity which is often improperly called equality andexpressedby 'equals' . Next we have thesentences that normally attribute a quality to a number , e.g., 'one iseven','one is odd ', 'two isprime', 'five isperfect'; and so on. Next we have the sentences that normally relate one numbertoanother , e.g., 'two exceeds three','three divides two', etc. These includethe identi› ties (or equalities, equations) already mentioned . Next we have the sentences that normally indicate that three numbersare in a ternary relation, e.g., 'two is between one andthree' , etc.\n\nThereare also quaternary relational sentences,e.g., 'one is tothreeas three is tonine'. And so on.Anything ofthissortis countenanced as long as there are no common nouns . Evencommon nouns are allowed as long as they areunderstood as nominalized adjectives (e.g., 'two is aprime' means \"two is prime\") or asnominalized relatives (e.g., 'two is a divisor of four' means \"two divides four\") , etc . Oncetheatomicbasic sentences ofarithmetic have been determined, the basic sentences can be defined as the so-called truth› functional combinations ofatomicsentences, theatomicsentences pluswhat can beobtained from atom ic sentences by negations, conjunctions , disjune-\n\ntions, conditionals, bi-conditionals , etc. It should be explicitly mentioned in thisconnection that passives (or converses) of binaryrelation verbs are againbinaryrelational verbs andthussentences such as 'two is dividedby four', 'two is exceeded by four ', etc . are included . Likewiseincludedare sentences involving the so-called modified relation verbs: 'properly divides', 'immediately precedes' , 'immediately exceeds', etc.\n\nBasic logic is the logic of basic propositions . Basic logic is concerned fun› damentally with the question of how we determine thevalidity or invalidity of anargument whose premisesand conclusion are exclusively basic propo› sitions. As you know, an argument is determined to be valid by giving a derivation (or adeduction) of its conclusion from its premises . This means giving anextended discourse,normally much longer than thepremises-plus › conclusion which shows step-by-stephow theconclusion can be seen to be truewere the premises true. The rules for making up these derivations are obtainedby looking atwhatpeople dowithbasic propos itionswhen they are reasoning correctly. In orderto deduce from any set of basic premises any basic conclusion that actually follows, it is sufficient to use rules from a very small set. These include theusual rules of propositionalogic,therule of substitution of identities, therule of conversion (the active andpassive are interdeducible) and the logical axioms of identity (\"one is one\", etc.) . To showthat a given basic conclusion does not follow from a given basic premise-set , it is sufficient to producea counterargument, i.e., a conclusion anda premise-settogether in thesame form and having false conclusion and truepremises. For example, to show that theargument on the left below is invalid it is sufficient to notice that theargument ontheright is in thesame formandhastrue premises and false conclusion.\n\n| Two is notthree .          | One is not two.            |\n|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Threeis not two plus two . | Two is not one times one . |\n| ? Two is not two plus two. | ? One is not one times e.  |\n\nTheargument on therightis obtained in three steps fromtheargument ontheleft.First'one' is substituted everywhere for 'two ' ontheleft . Thenin the \"new \" left argument (in which'two'no longer occurs), ' two' is substituted everywhere for'three'.Thenin the\"second new\" left argument, 'times' is substituted for'plus'.\n\nStrictly speakingan argument (more properly, premise-conclusion argu­ ment) is a twopartsystem composed of a set of propositionscalled the premise-set and a singlepropositioncalled the conclusion. To represent or express anargument we use anargument-text which is a list of sen­ tences (notpropositions)followed by a single sentence somehow markedas the conclusion-sentence. Some logic books use a line above the conclusion› sentence,butit is easier and less messy to use a question-mark as above . Themethodoutlined above oftransforming oneargument-text intoanother\n\nargument-text in such a way that theargument represented by thesecondis in thesame form astheargument represented by thefirst works only when the argument-texts arewritten in a so-called logically perfect language in which theouter grammatical form ofthesentences mirrors exactly theinnerlogicai form ofthepropositions . Whenlogical issues are important, thelanguage in question is regimented (normalized) so that it becomes logically perfect(or approximately so). This is why Iwrite'two plus (zero times one) ' instead of 'twoplus zero times one'. Logicianstypically go immediatelyto asymbolic language carefully constructed to be logically perfect butformanypurposes, especially that ofexposition, thismethod,though virtually essential for some purposes,can becounter-productive .\n\nBasic logic canbe called finite logic becauseevery finite invalid argument of basic logic is refutable by a counterargument whose propositionshave reference only to a finite numberofindividuals. By a finite argument I mean an argument having only a finite numberofpremises andby reference only to a finite numberof individuals I mean not only that thepropositions refer only to finitely manyindividuals (which is obvious) butalsothat thefunctions referred to are all defined on one and thesame finiteuniverse ofdiscourse.\n\nBy theway,thisincludes theso-called zero-premise arguments (arguments havingthenull premise-set)which are valid when and only when the conclu› sion is atautology. Some examplesfollow .\n\n- ? One is one.\n- ? If one is two thentwo is one.\n- ? If (if one is not two thenone is two)thenone is two.\n- ? If one exceeds two thentwo is exceeded by one.\n\nIt followsfrom whatwassaidabovethat every basic proposition that is not a contradiction is in thesame logical form as a true basic proposition having reference only to a finite numberof objects . This means that among the basic propositions there are noso-called infinity propositions. In orderfor a proposition to be an infinity proposition it isnecessary andsufficient that it be non-contradictory andfor every proposition in the same formhaving reference only to a finite numberofindividuals to be false. In other words aninfinity propositionis a propositionexpressedby a sentence which is \"satisfiable\" only in infinite universes of discourse.\n\nBasic logic covers most of thearithmetic reasoning done by school chil› dren,all of thelogic \"done\" by computers(though in a sensecomputers can simulate finite stretches ofhigher logics),andmuch ofthelogic on thenormal aptitude test .\n\nIn a sense, first-order logic (FOL) begins when we generalize basic propo› sitions. In fact, it is not stretching thingsto saythat basic tautologies are tautologies because theyare instances of first-order tautologies. Whenyou prove a basic tautology you feel that you have not exhausted yourreasoning\n\nin that direction . To illustrate hisI will give a basic tautology andthen give four first -order generalizations .\n\n- ? If three exceeds two thentwo is exceeded by three.\n- ? Everynumberexceedingtwo is anumberthat two isexceededby.\n- ? Everynumberthat three exceeds is exceeded by three.\n- ? Everynumberexceeding a givennumberis a numberthe given num› ber is exceeded by.\n- ? Everynumberthat a givennumberexceeds is exceeded by thegiven number.\n\nWe areinclined tothinkthat thebasic tautology is logically derivedfrom its generalization , e.g., that\"if threeexceeds two thentwo isexceededby three\"is truebecause\"everynumberexceedingtwo is onethat two is ex› ceeded by\" is true ... thus emphasizingthefactthat theformer is no peculiar› ity of three.Likewise weareinclined to think that thelatter generalization is true becauseofthetruth of its generalization, viz. \"Everynumberexceeding an arbitrary numberis one that thearbitrary numberis exceededby\" ... thusemphasizingthat no peculiarity of two is involved.\n\nThe first order sentences of arithmetic (FOSA) arethesentenc es obtain› able fromthebasic sentences by quantification andtakingtruth -functional combinations . It is important that these operations aretaken recursively, e .g., a basic sentence canbe generalized andthencombined withother general› izations by truth-functional combinations andthengeneralized againbefore taking further truth-functional combinations . The first-order propositions of arithmetic (FOPA) arethepropositions expressedby thefirst-order sentences interpreted in theusual way . Below is an exampleof one of thesimplestvalid arguments in first-order logic.\n\nEverynumberis either even or odd.\n\nNo numberis bothevenandodd.\n\nEverynumberwhich isoddis one whose squareis odd.\n\n- ? Everynumberwhosesquareis even isitself even.\n\nThereis a radical increase in expressivepower offirst-order languages as comparedto basiclanguages. Forexample,eventhefirstpremisein theabove argument implies infinitely manybasic consequences butit is not implied by anynumberof its basicconsequences, not even by all of themtogether . The idea that a generalization is logically equivalento theset of itssingular instances is butone ofthefallacies that is to beconfronted by thoseseeking to reduce first-order logic to basic logic . Below ar e a few ofthesingular instances of theproposition under discussion.\n\nOne iseither odd or even.\n\nTwo is either odd or even.\n\nThreeis either odd or even.\n\nAs mentionedabove basic logic issometimes called finite logic because each of its consistent (or non -contradictory) propositions is finitely sati sfiable . This is no longer trueof first-order logic. Indeed, theconjunct ion of the followingtwo propositions is notsatisfiable in any finite universe of discourse.\n\nZero isnotthesuccessor of any number .\n\nEvery two numberswhicharesuccessorsrespectively of distinct num› bers arethemselves distinct .\n\nIt is known , however, that everyfirst-order proposition which isconsistent is satisfiable in a countable universe of discourse. In fact , everyconsistent first-order proposition that is notsatisfiable in a finite universe of discourse is, like the above conjunction, satisfiable in theuniverse of natural numbers. For thisreason,first-order logic can be called countable logic.\n\nJustas every valid basic argument is deducible using a small set of ax› ioms and rules of inference , thesame is trueof valid first-order arguments. This means that as faras knowledge of validity of first-order arguments is concerned, humanknowing faculties are equal to thetask.The so-called prin› ciple of sufficiency of reason,viz. that everytrue proposition can be known to be true, can be shown to be false. Humanfaculties of knowing truth are not equal to thetaskof knowing truth -truth outruns knowledge . With validity offirst -order aryuments, reason is sufficient --everyvalidfirst-order argument can be known to be valid. Whether every validargument (whatever the or› der) can be known to be valid is a question of considerable complexityand well beyond thescope of thiselementary exposition .\n\nThereis another much less important fact about first-order andbasiclogic that is worth mentioning . Forthiswe have to divide the logical concepts into positive and negative. Without going into the details , let me saythat there are nosurpriseshere . \"Every \", \"Some\", \"Is\", \"And\", \"Or\", \"If' , etc . are positive . \"Not\", \"No\", \"Distinct\",\"Nor\", etc . are negative . The result is that everycontradictory first-order proposition involves at least onenegative logical concept .\n\nJustas wemotivated thetransition frombasic logic to first-order logic by reflecting on thefactthat thereasoning used toestablish a basic tautology seems stronger thanneeded for that purpose and indeed is sufficient (or virtually so) to establish allgeneralizations of thebasic tautology, we use th e same sort ofinsight t o transcend first-order logic.Considerthe following first-order propositions .\n\n## JOHN CORCORAN\n\nNo numberdividesexactly thenumbersthat do not divide themselves . No numberprecedesexactly thenumbersthat do notprecede them› selves .\n\nNo numberexceedsexactly thenumbersthat do not exceed themselves . Nonumberperfects exactly thenumbersthat do notperfect themselves.\n\nThe relation of perfecting arises inconnection with the so-called perfect numbers.Everynumberhavingproperdivisors isperfected only by thesuc › cessor of the sum of its properdivisors. The other numbers,viz. zero , one andthe primenumbers,are not perfected by anynumbersatall.Thusfour is perfected by three since two is theonlyproperdivisor of four. Butsix is perfected by itself. In fact, as you may have seen already, every p rfect num› ber perfects itself and, conversely, every numberperfecting itself is perfect. Now,thereason for introducing theperfecting relation is to give an example of atautology in thesame form asthefirstthree of the above set butnot as mathematically trivial. Thefirst of the above propositions is mathematically trivial because zero, which is theonlynumberthat does not divide itself, is dividedby everyother number . The second istrivial becauseeverynumber precedesother numbersbutnotitself.Thethird is trivial forsimilarreasons.\n\nNow, as you know , each of the above can be deduced from theirown respective negations by familiar(butintricate) reasoning.The fact is that thefollowing premise-conclusion argument is valid.\n\nSome numberperfects exactly thenumbersthat do notperfect them› selves.\n\n- ? No numberperfects exactly thenumbersthat do notperfect them› selves .\n\nA deduction of thisargument, i.e., a deduction of itsconclusion from its premise, can easily be transformed into anindirect proof of its conclusion. The reasonthat a deduction of aconclusion from thenull-premise set is a proof (i.e., a deduction whose premisesareknown to be true) is because uni› versalpropositions with null \"subjects\"are vacuously true . Everymember of thenull set of premises is known to be true. . . there being nocounterex › amples .\n\nOnce one of thesetautologies has been proved to be trueby a deduction fromthenull set of premises theothers are also virtually proved to be true also. The reason for this is the principleof form for deductions: every ar› gumentation in the same form as a deduction is againa deduction . Thusa proofof, say,thefourth can beobtainedfrom aproofof, say, the first by substituting in thelatter the conc ept \"perfects \" for the concept\"divides\". So it is clear that thereasoning establishing one ofthefour virtually establishes much more.\n\nNow we move to the second-order generalization of theabove . Actually, thefollowing second-order proposition is atonce ageneralization of each of theabove four first ordertautologies and, in a certain reasonable sense, the onlygeneralization.\n\nNo matter whichnumerical relation you consider , no numberbearsit toexactly thenumbersthat do notbearit tothemselves .\n\nOnce you have seen that thisis true you will feel that it is the ground of thetruth ofthepreviousfourpropositions, e.g., that thetruth ofthefourth ofthemdependson nopeculiarity oftheperfecting relation.\n\nMy main pointin thi s essay isthat thereasoning in a given logic achieves more than can beexpressedin that logicandthat thetranscending of a giv en logic by going to a higherorderis one way of reapingthefull fruit of one's reasoning in a given logic . This vagueprinciple appliesnotjusttofirst-order in relation to basic logic and to second-order logic inrelat ion to first-order butin general to any logic in relation tothenext lower order .\n\nIn basicsentences, there areno common nouns . In first-order sentences , thereare commonnouns,butno \"second-order nouns\" such as 'property', ' relation', ' function', etc. Thepresenceofnounsinevitably andautomatically entails thepresenceofquantifiers becausenounsrequ irearticles andarticles expressquantifiers . For example,thefollowing sentences expressthesame proposition .\n\nEvery false proposition implies atrueproposition.\n\nEveryproposition which is false implies some proposition which istrue.\n\nFor every proposition which is false there existsa proposition which is true and which is implied by thefalseproposition.\n\nThe same phenomenoncanbe exemplified intheuniverseof natural numbers(beginningwithzero) .\n\nEvery oddnumberexceeds an even number .\n\nEverynumberwhich isoddexceeds somenumberwhich is even.\n\nFor every numberwhich isoddthere existsa numberwhich is even and which is exceeded by theodd number .\n\nWhenwe move tosecond -order by addingsecond-order nounswe alsoadd second-order adjectiveswhoseranges of significance are the second-order ob› jectsdenoted by thesecond-order nouns.Examplesofsecond-order adjectives arethefamiliartermsindicating properties of relations: reflexive, symmet› rical,transitive, dense, etc . Thefollowing are typical second-order sentences involving such expressions .\n\n## JOHN CORCORAN\n\nEveryreflexive relation relates everyobjectto itself.\n\nEveryrelation that relates everyobjecttoitself is reflexive.\n\nEverysymmetricrelation relates to each other every two objects one of which itrelates to theother.\n\nEveryrelation that relates to each other every two objects one of which it relates totheother is symmetric.\n\nOrthogonality is a second-orderelation betweenproperties.In orderfor one property to beorthogonal toanother it isnecessary andsufficient that therebe fourobjects,one havingbothproperties,one havingthefirstbut lackingthesecond, onelackingthefirstbut havingthesecond, and one lacking both.Theseexamplesshowthat much ofthisessay has been written using asecond-order language .\n\nSince basic logic is finite andsince first-order logic iscountable, neither is adequate toaxiomatize theories whose universes of discourse are uncount› able. The most familiar examplesof suchtheories arecalculus andgeometry. Nowjustas first-order logic is not finite, second-order logic is not countable . Thereareconsistent second-order propositionswhich are not satisfiable in any countable universe . One exampleis from Hilbert's axiom set forthe theory of real numbers(which isfoundational forcalculus). Another is from Veblen 's axiom set for Euclidean geometry.Naturally, second-order logic can be called uncountable logic.\n\nFirst-order logic isnoteven adequate to axiomatize theories whose uni› verses of discourse arecountably infinite . Theparadigmcase ofsucha theory is numbertheory, or thearithmetic of natural numbers,whichrequires the principle of mathematical induction (PM!) .\n\nEveryproperty belonging to zero andtothesuccessor of everynumber to which it belongs also belongs to every numberwithout exception.\n\nfor\n\nIn orderfor apropertyto belong to every numberit is sufficient that property to belong to thesuccessor of everynumberhavingit and alsothat zero have it.\n\nMathematical induction is thesecond-order generalization of each of the following propositions which are amongits first-order instances.\n\nIf zero is even and thesuccessorof every even numberis even, then everynumberis even .\n\nIf zero isperfect andthesuccessor of everyperfect numberis perfect, then everynumberis perfect.\n\nIn first-order axiomatizations ofarithmetic PMI, induction, is replaced by theinfinite set of its first-order instances, a set which is insufficient to imply\n\nmathematical induction. In fact, no setoftrue first-order propositions is suf› ficient to imply PMI andtherefore nofirst-order axiomatization ofarithmetic adequately codifiesourknowledge of arithmetic . Moreover, theground of our knowledge of theinstances is ourknowledge of PMI itself.Thus infinitely manyof the so-called axiomsoffirst-order arithmetic arenotaxiomatic in the traditional sense. Nevertheless, there are able logicians andmathematicians who reject the traditional second-order axiomatizations due toDedekindand Peanoin favor ofirst-order axiomatizations whichdatefrom the1930's.\n\nJustas second-order logic isnecessary to fully exploit first-order reasoning as well as to understand theground offirst-order tautologies, likewise second› order logic isnecessary to fully exploit first-order knowledge in arithmetic as well as to understand thegroundof acceptance of first-order axiomatiza› tionsof arithmetic . Evenlogicians who reject second-order axiomatizations of arithmetic admit theirhistoric importance and makeheuristic and ped› agogical use of such axiomatizations. By theway, thesame thingmay be saidofaxiomatizations ofsettheory, butthetechnical details involved in set theory require distinctions andprincipleswhich gobeyondthescope ofthis essay.\n\nIn thecase of basic logic, as well as that of first-order logic , a small set of simple rules of inferences suffices to enableevery valid argument to be deduced . This is no longer thecase withsecond-order logic. In fact , it is a corollary tothefamous G6delIncompleteness Theoremthat nosimple set of rules is sufficient for thispurpose . This means that theprinciple of sufficiency ofreasonwhenappliedtosecond-order validity is false. To be explicit , there are finite valid arguments in second-order logic whose conclusions can not be deduced(in a finite numberofstepsusing simple rules) from theirpremise › sets . This result is known asthe incompleteness of second-order logic.\n\nThereare logicians who feel that humanreasoning must be equalto the taskofdetermining thevalidity of valid arguments. In most cases such lo› gicians are empiricistically oriented and are fully willing to acceptthefact that there aretrue propositions about thematerial universe that cannotbe known to be true . Buttheyfeelthat validity is intrinsically amenableto analytic a priori methodsand,in particular, that every valid argument must be deducible. One way outof thisquandary is to denythat second-order logic is really logic .\n\nIncidentally, second-order axiomatizations do not evade the incompletabil› ity of arithmetic . First-order axiomatizations are deficient becausefirst-order languages are too weak to expressourknowledge of arithmetic even though first-order reasoning is adequate to first-order validity . Withinsecond-order thesituation is reversed.Second-order axiomatizations are deficient because second -orderreasoningis too weak to deduce all of theconsequences of second-order axioms even thoughsecond-order language is strongenough toexpressourknowledge of arithmetic . In fact,oursecond-order arithmetic knowledge implies absolutely everytrue second-order arithmetic proposition\n\neventhosethat we are powerless to deduce(using any given simple set of rules fixed in advance).\n\nAnother phenomenon that gives some logicians doubtsabout second-order logic isexistence ofcontradictory propositions devoid of negative logical con› cepts. Recall that in first-order logic every contradictory proposition involves at least one negative logical concept. Below are two second-order proposi› tionsthefirst of which is tautological andthesecond of which is contradictory, neither of which involve negative logical concepts.\n\nEveryobjecthas atleast one property .\n\nEveryproperty belongsto atleast oneobject.\n\nThereasonthat thesecondproposition is self-contradictory is that it con› tradicts thefollowing tautology.\n\nNo objecthas theproperty of beingdistinct from itself.\n\nWe have seenthatsecond-order logic differs radically from first-order. First-order is a logic of countability; second-order is a logic of uncountabil› ity. First-order is deductively complete ; second-order is deductively incom› plete. In first-order everycontradiction is negative; in second-order there are self-contradictory propositionswhich are exclusively positive. The above› mentionedhistoric examplesofaxiomatized sciencesremindus that higher› orderreasoning is not arecentinnovation but rather a feature of human thought havinga longhistory . Moreover, it is notthecase that logicians started outstudying basic logic and thenmoved on tofirst-order andthen tosecond-order, etc. Inthefirst place, Aristotle's logic is a fragment of first› orderandfundamental aspectsof basic logic were not to be discoveredfor some centuries later. In the second place, in moderntimes higher-order logics werestudied before first-order logic was isolated as asystemworthy ofstudy in its ownright .\n\nAfterAristotle 's logic had been assimilatedby later thinkers,people emergedwho couldnot accepttheidea that Aristotle's logic was not com› prehensive . Theseconservative logicians attempted to \"reduce\"all logically cogentreasoning to Aristotle's syllogistic logic. Likewise , after first-order logic had been isolated and had beenassimilated by thelogiccommunity, peopleemergedwhocouldnotaccepttheidea that first-order logic was not comprehensive.Theselogicians can be viewed not as conservatives who want toreinstate an outmodedtradition butrather as radicals who want to over› throw an established tradition . It remainsto be seenwhether higher -order logic will ever regain thedegree of acceptance that it enjoyed between1910 and 1930.Butthere has never been a seriousdoubtconcerning its heuristic andhistoric importance . In fact , people who do not know second-order logic can not understand themoderndebateover itslegitimacy andtheyare cut› off fromtheheuristic advantages ofsecond-order logic. And , whatmay be\n\nworse,theyare cut-off from an understanding ofthehistory of logic andthe history of mathematics , andthusareconstrained to have distorted views of thenature ofthetwosubjects.As Aristotle first said , we do notunderstand a discipline until we have seen its development . It is atruismthat a person's conceptions of whata discipline is and of whatit can become are predicated on aconception ofwhatit has been .\n\n## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThis essay is based on atutorial that I led at the Ohio University Inference Conference, October 9-11,1986. I am indebted toProfessor Richard Butrick not only for organizing theconference butalso for organizing me. In the yearpriortotheconference he suppliedme, by phone andin writing, with dozens of questions, hypotheses, suggestions andrequests from which the ba› sic content andgoals of my tutorial emerged . James Gasser , Woosuk Park and Ronald Rudnicki helped with theeditingand proof-reading . I am also indebtedto thestudents andcolleagues withwhom I studiedsecond -order logic over the years, especially George Weaver, Stewart Shapiro, Michael Scanlan and EdwardKeenan . Verylittle in this essay is original. Most of whatis here isalready in thewritings of Alfred Tarski, Leon Henkin, Alonzo Church , Georg Kreisel and George Boolos. Almost every humanistically ori› ented essay on modernlogic isindebted to Tarski, Church, andQuine. Their technical competence,their objectivity, their creativity and, above all, their constant attention tothehumanimportance of logic are largely responsible forpreserving, transforming andrevitalizing a rich tradition that traces back toAristotle . One sign of thevitality ofthetradition is thefactthat not one of the above-mentioned logicians agrees with everything written in this essay , even when the heuristic over-simplifications are emended.",
