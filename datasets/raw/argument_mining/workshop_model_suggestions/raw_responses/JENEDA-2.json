The goal of this paper is to clarify such claims and draw conceptual  distinctions  separating  the  depressive  states  that  are  pathological  from  those that are normal and normative responses to misfortune. I do so by appeal to early modern writing  on  melancholy  by  Robert  Burton,  where  the  inchoate  and  boundless  nature  of melancholy symptoms are emphasized; universal suffering  is  separated  from  the  disease states known as melancholy or melancholia, and normal temperamental variation is placed in contrast to such disease states. In Burton's time these distinctions and characterizations could be secured by the anchoring tenets of humoral theory. Without such anchoring, and in light of the findings and assumptions of today's biological diagnostic psychiatry, we must re-visit each of them. My goals here are to show the need for analytic foundations when claims are made about depression such as those cited above, and to draw attention to some contemporary attempts that may help provide those foundations, particularly, attempts to define disorder or disease. With adjustments, one of these (Cooper 2002) is shown to take us some way toward that goal.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe  particular  report  prompting  the  following  discussion  described widespread use of medication for depression symptoms among adolescent  girls  in  a  refugee  camp  in  Chad.  More  generally  though,  I take as my starting point data citing the ubiquity and rapid increase of depression wherever war, want and social upheaval are to be found: 120 million people worldwide suffer from depression, we are told; by 2020 depression  will  be  the  second  leading  cause  of  ill  health  world-wide; depression is the greatest source of disability as measured by Years Lived with Disability; 9.5% Mexican adults suffer depression; the greatest costs of  Hurricane  Katrina,  the  latest  mudslide,  tsunami,  civil  war  and earthquake will be in terms of depression, and so on.\n\nOf  the  several  aspects  of  today's  apparent  epidemic  of  depression deserving philosophical examination, my focus is on preliminaries. How is  depression understood when claims such as these are made? What is\n\nits  relation  to  more  ordinary  states  of  suffering  and  distress,  and  to normal temperamental differences? What are the limits of the concept? In this paper, I attempt to clear conceptual spaces around the condition(s)  alluded  to  in  accounts  citing  data  on  the  incidence  of depression. I do so by appeal to early modern writing, particularly that found in Robert Burton's great Anatomy of Melancholy , published in 1621. The  earlier  notion  of  melancholia  and  that  of  depression  as  it  is understood today cannot be simply equated. Yet Burton's era also saw melancholy  and  melancholia  in  what  were  believed  to  be  'epidemical' proportions.  And,  there  are  significant  parallels  between  the  broad category of melancholic states employed by Burton and today's notion of depression  that  invite  application  of  some  of  the  same  conceptual distinctions. In particular, early modern writing emphasizes the inchoate and  boundless  nature  of  melancholy  symptoms;  universal  suffering  is separated from the disease states known as melancholy or melancholia, and normal temperamental variation is placed in contrast to such disease states.\n\nIn  Burton's  time  the  distinctions  and  characterizations  just  noted could  be  secured  by  the  anchoring  tenets  of  humoral  theory.  Without such humoral anchoring, and in light of the findings and assumptions of today's  biological  diagnostic  psychiatry,  we  must  re-visit  each  of  them. My  goals  in  this  brief  discussion  are  to  show  the  need  for  analytic foundations when claims are made about depression such as those cited above, and to draw attention to some contemporary attempts that may help provide those foundations.\n\nBefore turning to Burton's claims, one terminological clarification is necessary. 'Melancholy' and 'melancholia' were terms not systematically distinguished until a later period, and  during  Burton's  era their employment was inexact, covering passing normal states, severe medical conditions,  and  enduring,  natural  temperamental  types.  In  common parlance  today,  rather  similarly,  the  term  'depression'  covers  a  wide range  of  sub-clinical  or  normal  responses  as  well  as  the  more  severe, lasting  conditions  that  are  acknowledged  to  be  disorders.  Others  have\n\nattempted to restrict 'depression' to clinical conditions. But the present discussion  follows  the  looser  usage:  states  of  distress  that  are  normal responses  as  well  as  those  that  are  pathological  are  each  'depressive states,' their sufferers, at least temporarily, 'depressed.'\n\nDistinctions  among these  different  depressives  states  are  the  focus of what follows. Other than social and cultural nostalgia for the wisdom enshrined in writing such as Burton's, it might be asked, why should we care  to  preserve  these  distinctions?  One  answer  to  that  question  is perhaps  an  aesthetic  and  cultural  preference  only.  The  tendency  to collapse distinctions such as that between normal  suffering and depressive disorder comes at a cost in the richness of our experience and understanding. A world in which all suffering had been reduced to medical  symptoms  would  be  an  impoverished  one,  despite  the  good brought  by  modern  medicine.  A  second  answer  possesses  real  moral heft. Collapsing these distinctions seems all too likely to forestall social and political action not only more fitting but, in directing itself toward the  causes  of  much  of  this  suffering,  more  effective.  The  hapless inhabitants of refugee camps may suffer depression, and may require medical  intervention.  But  if  that  intervention  comes  at  the  cost  of neglecting why they are there in the first place, and why they sufferthat is,  the  questions  spurring  social  and  political  action-then it  will be difficult to justify.  The  apparent collapse of the boundaries separating  these  kinds  of  human  suffering  and  the  importance  of maintaining  conceptual  space  around  depressive  disorder  have  been the subject of recent concerns (Horwitz and Wakefield 2007). Moreover,  such  concerns  may  be  seen  as  part  of  a  broader  whole. Erosion of distinctions at the boundary of our categories of disease and disorder occurs where forms of 'enhancement' apply medical treatments to non-medical conditions. Although it is not one dealt with here, this practice has rightly been recognized to jeopardize important moral distinctions. (For a discussion of some of the issues involved and far-reaching  implications  of  losing  sight  of  this  allied  distinction,  see Elliott and Kramer 2003, Conrad 2007.)\n\nBurton famously insisted  that  melancholy  states  were  universal,  the lot  of  humankind.  Melancholy  is  nothing  less  than  the  Character  of Mortalitie. And 'From Melancholy Dispositions â€¦ no man living is free.' Melancholy Dispositions are for Burton distinguishable from melancholy the  'Habit,'  however.  Melancholy  dispositions  make  us  'dull,  sad,  sour, lumpish, ill-disposed, solitary, any way moved or displeased.' As a Habit, melancholy is 'a chronic or continuate disease, a settled humour â€¦ not errant,  but  fixed.'  In  some  people,  'these  Dispositions  become  Habits.' For  Burton,  it  seems,  no  human  can  avoid  melancholy  states  but  only some  will  succumb  to  melancholy  the  disease,  when  disease  is  in  this discussion indicated by the settled, or chronic, nature of those states.\n\nBurton  is  clearly  leaving  a  conceptual  space  for  distress  that  is  not pathological.  Mistaken  as  we  would  now  say  he  was  in  his  humoral assumptions, moreover, he had in humoral theory a means of distinguishing the two kinds of melancholy state by appeal to underlying causation. The disease of melancholy was marked by adustion, when the black  bile  became  heated  and  smoky  vapors  interfered  with  brain functioning causing the disturbances of imagination that in turn brought apprehensive and disspirited mood states of melancholy. These machinations are explained more fully, and embraced more literally, in some  earlier  works,  such  as  Timothy  Bright's Treatise  of  Melancholy (1586). And by the time of Burton's writing references to the black bile have begun to take on something of the quality of metaphor. Nonetheless, humoral theory provided a full explanation: the chronicity of the disease of melancholy was the result of adustion.\n\nThis  distinction  between  pathological  and  more  normal  suffering does not always receive stress in Burton's Anatomy. (In that rambling and inconsistent compendium, few distinctions are systematically employed .) Nor does it in the rest of the canon of writing on melancholy from that era.  As  products  of  natural  and  unnatural  humoral  arrangements, normal  melancholy  and  pathological  melancholy  differ  at  most  as variations on a unitary condition, and only in extreme cases or through long term study will melancholy the disease be observably different from\n\nmore normal melancholy states and temperaments. Rather than immediately observable, this is a distinction attributable to and theoretically provided  for by the complex  variations,  normal  and abnormal, in the black bile.\n\nMelancholy's  nature  as  inchoate  and  boundless  was  also  able  to  be accommodated by humoral lore. 'The tower of Babel never yielded such confusion  of  tongues  as  this  Chaos  of  Melancholy  doth  variety  of  its symptoms,'  says  Burton,  in  one  of  many  efforts  to  emphasize  the unbounded, open-ended nature of the symptomatology and subjectivity of melancholy. The force of this conviction of Burton's was not that the concept of melancholy could not be bounded, but that the plethora of its symptoms in the world could not. That unbounded-ness made it hard, or even impossible to provide a list of all melancholy's symptoms, but not to define it. Because of the anchoring and unifying role played by humoral explanations, the diversity and unbounded variety of symptoms provided  no  reason  to  question  whether  melancholy  was  one  thing  or many. Again, it is arguable that Burton was drifting away from a literal reading of humoral theory, and that remarks such as the above prefigure a  Wittgensteinian  'family  resemblance'  conception  of  the  category  of melancholy.  Ostensibly,  though,  Burton  accepted  that  such  symptoms were united by their source in the endless variations of the humor.\n\nIdeally,  if  we  are  to  remain  faithful  to  the  parallel  with  Burton,  an account of pathological depression will contain explanatory force, attributing pathological depression to the brain states, and or experiences, which caused it. And it is true that today's causal analyses sometimes postulate such antecedents. Compromising resilience to life's vicissitudes, preexisting genetic and  other  biological conditions of vulnerability  such  as  reduced  volume  of  the  hippocampus  and  an absence  of  glial  cells  are  thought  by  some  to  combine  with  adverse experiences  to  yield  the  depressive  response.  (See  Kramer  2005,  for example.)  These  are  controversial  interpretations  of  what  are  thus  far ambiguous findings, however. (For a critique of such interpretations, see Horwitz and Wakefield 2007: 175-177). Science may eventually confirm\n\nsuch hypotheses and secure conceptual space around depressive disorder  with  a  causal  definition.  Meanwhile,  though,  we  must  at  least insist on the difference, and honor philosophical efforts to preserve it.\n\nWithout  anchoring  humoral  theory,  then,  we  face  a  conceptual problem: depressive states of despair, discouragement, numbness, dispiritedness, sadness, demoralization, anxiety and grief result not only from biological and inter psychic causes, but from the vicissitudes of life. And  they  are,  as  Burton  says,  the  lot  of  humankind.  The  effects  of ordinary love and loss affect us with what appear to be states indistinguishable from the symptoms of major depression and dysthymia. So too do experiences like painful social disruption, deprivation and oppression. Because it no longer adheres to humoral or other causal  analyses  and  is  instead  solely  'descriptive'  in  its  account  of symptoms, contemporary diagnostic psychiatry appears without a way to secure  the conceptual  distinction  between  these  different  kinds  of depression. (Horwitz and Wakefield make this point when they contrast the  earlier  'contextualized'  approaches  with  the  de-contextualized  one adopted  with  the  descriptivist  1980  DSM-III  (Horwitz  and  Wakefield 2007).)\n\nThe social and political origins of many depressive symptoms have been  acknowledged  and  emphasized.  Philosopher  Jennifer  Hansen speaks  of  'a  worldwide  human  illness  that  reveals  important  truths about our relationship to political and economic structures in culture' and 'says something about what pressures and freedoms culture offers individuals' (Hansen 2003:61). And a diagnosis of Dysthymic Disorder, it  has  been  observed,  will  likely  represent  the medicalization  of  social problems in  much  of  the  world,  where  severe  economic,  political  and health constraints create 'endemic feelings of hopelessness and helplessness,  where  demoralization  and  despair  are  responses  to  real conditions of chronic deprivation and persistent loss, where powerlessness is not a cognitive distortion but an accurate mapping of one's place in an oppressive social system â€¦'  (This is medical anthropologist, Arthur Kleinman (1987:452).)\n\nPreserving the conceptual space around depression understood as a real disorder rather than a more normal response-whether to oppressive conditions or to life's vicissitudes-is a goal with practical, as well  as  theoretical,  interest  and  implications.  The  task  is  to  justify  and account for  the  presumption  that  states  of  pathological  depression  are importantly distinct from normal responses to life's vicissitudes, and to explain why the disease or illness status of depression is not arbitrarily assigned.  Practical  implications  include  when  and  whether  to  treat; remedies and or preventive measures, and questions of resource allocation; how to understand the role of the sufferer, and so on.\n\nThe category of non-pathological depression is a heterogeneous one, as we have seen, including responses to experiences and states of affairs both  avoidable  and  unavoidable,  the  results  of  human  nature  and  the human  condition,  as  well  as  of  seemingly  contingent  and  preventable forms  of  oppression  and  misfortune.  No  matter  what  their  situation, humans have pride and suffer from slights; they form close attachments, so  suffer  when  loved  ones  suffer,  grieve  when  they  die,  and  so  on. Perhaps due to this heterogeneity, instances of non-pathological suffering  will  not  permit  ready  characterization,  and  efforts  at  analytic definition have been focused on circumscribing pathological rather than normal suffering.\n\nThis  is  a  challenge  that  has  received  considerable  attention  from philosophers  and  other  theorists,  and  three  approaches  to  defining pathological  suffering  are  distinguishable  among  their  efforts.  One  of these  dismisses  the  distinction,  not  acknowledging  any  real  difference between pathological depression and more normal depressive responses. This,  we  shall  see,  is  the  position  adopted  by  Freud  and,  later,  by Melanie Klein. In a second approach, the suffering resulting from more normal and normative causes is separated from pathological suffering by exclusion. This is the approach adopted by the authors of the DSMs, for instance (American Psychiatric Association 1994). Pathological depression is characterized as a syndrome or pattern that is not merely an  'expectable  or  culturally  sanctioned'  response,  such  as  grief  and\n\nmourning.  A  third  approach  attempts  to  circumscribe  pathological depression  by  providing  an  analytic  definition  of  affective  disorder, mental disorder, or disease, within which it can be seen to fall. Summed up, these three approaches offer the following prescriptions:\n\n- (1) deny  there  is  any  real  difference  between  pathological  and normal/normative suffering (Freud and Klein, for example)\n- (2) exclude normal and normative suffering by fiat (DSM approach)\n- (3) find a definition for pathological  depression  (affective or mental disorder, or disorder) that can be used to exclude other forms of suffering.\n\nBefore turning to (3), as the most promising of these approaches, one or two comments about (1) and (2) are required. Seemingly recognizing the conceptual contrast we are concerned to preserve, Freud later spoke of psychoanalysis as transforming neurotic misery into ordinary unhappiness.  Yet  exploring  the  difference  between  normal  mourning and pathological depression in his famous 1917 essay on mourning and melancholia, he concluded that normal and pathological responses were really equally pathological . Mourning does not seem to us as pathological, he states,  only  because  'â€¦  we  know so well  how to explain [it]' (Freud 1967:153). Melanie Klein also insists that 'because this state of mind is common and seems so natural to us, we do not call mourning an illness' (Klein  1935:354).  Stephen  Wilkinson  draws  the  same  conclusionalthough  ironically  as  part  of  a reductio argument-when  he  identifies insufficiencies  in  each  of  the  criteria  proposed  to  distinguish  normal grief  from  pathological depression (Wilkinson 2000). Because it simply denies the conceptual space between normal and pathological suffering, this position violates our intuitive sense that these forms of suffering are importantly different and of the reasoning provided at the outset of this essay. If preserving such conceptual space is a defensible goal, then the answer provided in (1) is question begging.\n\nThe method of exclusion  by  fiat  employed  in  (2),  and  reference  to responses that are 'expectable or culturally sanctioned' requires further clarification. It must be noted, first, that not all expectable responses will be culturally sanctioned and not all that are culturally sanctioned may be expected. In the present discussion 'normal' refers to responses that are expected  and  'normative'  is  reserved  for  those  that  are  culturally sanctioned,  with  the  understanding  that  many  normal  reactions  are proscribed or treated with moral indifference, while responses that are normative reflect evaluations as to appropriateness, fittingness or moral acceptability. Death of loved ones is not only expected to bring sadness and grief, such a response is judged appropriate and proper, the person who fails to feel it morally wanting. More generally, whether and how a person  suffers  in  response  to  life's  vissicitudes  functions  as  a  central indicator of moral character in our, and probably every, society.\n\nSecond,  although  many  other  experiences  will  bring  comparable sadness  and  be  both  normal  and  normative,  mourning  is  offered  as  a sole  example  of  a  culturally  expected  response  by  the  authors  of  the DSM. In this respect, grief is thus positioned as a prototype of normal responses  of  sadness  and  distress. 1 Since  whatever  the  variations  their cultural expression may take, some such responses to the death of loved ones  seem  to  be  close  to  universal,  the  example  of  the  depressed responses associated with grief and mourning is a compelling one. Even as an instance of distress that is incontestably normative, however, grief shades into a penumbra that is relative to particular cultures and even to particular  individuals,  where  norms  are  controversial,  unsettled,  and contested.  Within  the  scope  of  'mourning'  we  can  encounter  differing moral intuitions over the appropriateness of responding with grief to the loss of a pet, for example, an aborted or miscarried foetus, a romantic\n\n1  Horwitz  and  Wakefield  similarly  position  grief  as  the  paradigm.  They  do  so  with  the explanation that all forms of normal and even adaptive sadness are instances of 'loss,' on analogy with the loss suffered upon the death of a loved one. I have commented elsewhere on the risk of trivialization  incumbent  in  sweeping 'loss'  analyses  such  as  these  (Radden 2000a, and 2000b: 222-226).\n\nrelationship,  or  a  slowly  eroded  friendship.  Norms  surrounding  these and  many  other  responses  to  life  experience  seem  to  be  less  agreed upon, less stable, and less clear-cut.\n\nMourning the loss of a loved one, then, is in this respect an unusual case and, I now want to stress, a rather misleading one. In cultures more traditional  than  our  own,  reliance  on  the  appropriateness  of  certain responses relative to cultural mores may serve to distinguish normal and normative suffering, even in these and other less clear cut cases. But in non-traditional cultures such as that of the US, questions of appropriateness,  rationality,  and  proportionality  are  controversial  and contested.  Moreover,  in  today's  non-traditional  society,  mental  health norms are more often appealed to as arbiters than framed by other norms. They are also clubs in the increasingly fractious war over the applicability of medical presuppositions to cultural structures and strictures.\n\nUnder these circumstances and within non-traditional cultures such as the US one, the method of exclusion employed in (2) leaves dangerously arbitrary and  vulnerable  the  line  between  normal  and  pathological depression.  Faced  with  this  controversy,  it  seems  sensible  to  turn  to  the remaining approach, (3), finding a definition of pathological suffering to distinguish it from depression that is more normal and normative.\n\nEfforts  to  define  disease  or  disorder  often  appeal  to  the  concept  of (harmful)  dysfunction,  and  certainly  a  notion  of reduced  functioning, disability, or incapacity is  central  to  lay  conceptions  of  mental  illness. Moreover the usual facultative divisions into cognition, memory, motivation, perception, judgment, feeling and so on, provide us with a map of the kinds of psychological dysfunction associated with particular mental  disorders.  (It  is  the  very  facultative  map,  indeed,  on  which mental disorders were originally classified.)\n\nBut not only are normal and pathological depression indistinguishable in terms of their symptom expression, as we saw earlier-resulting in pain as  intense,  sadness  as  profound,  and  despair  as  overwhelming,  for example-so  they  are in terms of an everyday sense of reduced functioning.  Depression  and  suffering  resulting  from  life's  vicissitudes\n\nsometimes render their sufferer both equally or more apparently dysfunctional  than  those  whose  suffering  is  the  symptom  of  disorder. Pathological depression, habituated despair and discouragement wrought of powerlessness, as well as genuine grief, all have the effect of deadening responses, dampening motivation, slowing and compromising cognition, for  example;  in  this  respect,  they  are  equally  likely  to  interfere  with 'getting on with things.' So while it is a key to lay understanding of other forms of mental disorder, observable dysfunction cannot be interpreted as an attribute distinguishing pathological from more ordinary misery.\n\nDysfunction also enters into more formal definitions of disorder (APA 1994,  Boorse  1975,  Wakefield  1992,  Megone  2000,  Horwitz  2002).  In the two best known of these types of definition, disease (or disorder) is defined as dysfunction relative to norms  of functioning in  some reference group (Boorse), and as dysfunction that is a maladaptive in the evolutionary sense (Wakefield). (Both accounts, it should be pointed out, accept  the  analogies  between  mental  or  psychological  and  organic conditions  and  neither  draws  a  significant  difference  between  'disease' and 'disorder.')\n\nBut both definitions have also been subject to extensive and damaging criticism. Critiques of Boorse's account of dysfunction relative to  a  reference  group  press  on  the  difficulties  of  fixing  on  a suitable reference group. (See, for example, Cooper 2002: 266-267.) Additional difficultly  is  involved  when  this  effort  concerns  normal  and  normative depression.  The  effects  of  life's  vicissitudes  on  individual  character  are widely  variable,  depending  as  they  do  on  idiosyncratic  values,  ideals, goals and self-identity. Isolating the appropriate reference group against which one person's dysfunction could be judged abnormal will likely be even more difficult than settling on the appropriate reference norms for demarcating ordinary physical diseases. Consider for example, a group comprising X who believes in an afterlife; Y who does not and instead accepts a tragic view of life, and Z who, having no fixed opinion on such matters, is convinced that value lies in a dignified approach to whatever comes. Or, consider R and S, an undertaker and a clown, respectively,\n\neach committed to the same worldview. With the latitude created by this sort  of  meaning-driven  and  idiosyncratic  variability,  the  designation  of an appropriate reference group must be an unacceptably arbitrary one.\n\nIts unsubstantiated, empirical, essentialist assumptions about the way natural selection underlies natural functions have been widely noted as substantial  and  perhaps  irreparable  flaws  in  Wakefield's  analysis.  (See also  Cooper 2002, Culver and Gert 2004, Woolfolk and Murphy 2000, Poland 2002, Lilienfeld and Marino 1995.)\n\nDissatisfied with accounts of disease as (harmful) dysfunction, whether  defined  statistically  or  by  appeal  to  evolutionary  psychology, Rachel Cooper has proposed a different approach, and I want to devote some attention to this alternative. Cooper introduces a set of conditions she believes necessary and sufficient for 'disease,' as understood within the  medical  paradigm:  (1)  diseases  are  bad  things  to  have;  (2)  the afflicted  person  is  unlucky,  and  (3)  the  affliction  can  potentially  be medically treated (Cooper 2002). 2 This definition seems a promising one and,  in  light  of  the  now  well-rehearsed  problems  associated  with  both Boorsian and Wakefield accounts, deserves a closer look.\n\nAlthough  Cooper's  criteria  derive  from  ordinary  non-psychiatric disorder and disease, we can simplify her analysis for our purposes here (and reduce their vulnerability to counter example) by limiting the scope of  (1)-(3)  in  this  definition-proposing  them  as  definitive  of affective disorder or disease only.  Still,  Cooper's  criteria  are  not  quite  sufficient  to exclude all normal and normative suffering. Normal responses are also sometimes bad luck, as Cooper accounts for it, vis., the sufferers 'could reasonably  have  hoped it  might  have  been  otherwise..'  because,  as  she puts it, either (i) they feel worse compared with an earlier state; (ii) they consider themselves worse off than others, and or (iii) they believe there is  a  good  chance  that  everyone  could  be  better  off.  The  oppressed inhabitants  of  a  refugee  camp,  or  the  AIDS  orphan  could  be  in  each category described in (i)-(iii). Moreover,  (i)-(iii) introduce another\n\n2 This last condition finds its origins in work on disease by Reznek (1987).\n\nproblem. As subjective assessments made by the patient, (i)-(iii) may not capture  all  conditions  we  would  normally  suppose  to  be  affective disorders or diseases. The manic patient would be unlikely to assess her situation  this  way,  for  example,  and  indeed,  relying  on  subjective assessment  with  many  mood  disordered  patients  will  raise  the  same problem. As pathological states, both mania  and  depression  very typically  affect  the  capacity  to  make  global  comparisons  of  the  kind captured in (i).  This problem will require a reformulation of (i) in less subjective  language,  so  that  the  explication  of  'bad  luck'  now  reads: either (i) they feel or are worse compared with an earlier state; (ii) they consider themselves worse off than others, and or (iii) they believe there is a good chance that everyone could be better off.\n\nFinally,  Cooper's  third  condition  seems  naÃ¯ve,  even  Panglossian. Once a  method  of  remedying  a  particular  condition  is  developed  and placed in the hands of a medical practitioner (and others able to exploit the situation for gain), as Carl Elliot has observed, that condition 'tends to become re-conceptualized as a medical problem'(2004: 429). The rush to medicate all forms of depression in the present 'anti-depressant era' attests  that  normal  and  or  normative  depressive  responses  can  be  and (many  think)  too  often  are,  medically  treated.  This  point  has  been stressed  in  recent  analyses  noting  the  powerful  forces  aligned  by  a common  interest  in  medicalizing,  over-diagnosing  and  over-treating ordinary depressive states. (See Healy 1994, 2004, Horwitz and Wakefield 2007.)\n\nIn  light  of  these  concerns,  several  qualifications  can  be  added  to Cooper's conditions. Ill fate is customarily distinguished from misfortunes resulting  from  injustice,  when  this  is  a  morally  significant  difference. Employing  this  distinction,  we  can  insist  that  those  suffering  diseases (disorders)  believe  themselves  unlucky  becausenot  as  the result of  a violation of their human rights -they feel or are worse compared to an earlier state, consider themselves worse off than others and or believe there is a good  chance  everybody  could  be  better  off.  As  stated,  this  qualification may be too stringent. For it will also serve to exclude some conditions we\n\nwould  intuitively  judge  to  be  genuine  disorders  or  diseases,  such  as schizophrenia. (Arguably, for example, a failure to provide treatment for those with severe disorders such as schizophrenia might be regarded as a violation of their human rights.) A more complete qualification will define being unlucky as feeling worse, etc., not merely as the result of a violation of their  human  rights. This  adjustment  should  serve  to  exclude  normal  and normative suffering that results from injustice.\n\nCooper's third condition concerning medical treatment that we saw to be naÃ¯ve given the current climate of over-treatment, invites a second qualification. The affliction can be potentially medically treated and, we may  add, does  not  lend  itself  to  more  obvious,  effective,  socially  sanctioned, remedies and or preventive measures.\n\nThe group of responses making up normal and normative suffering, it  was  pointed  out  earlier,  is  heterogeneous.  Those  resulting  from bereavement are an apparently unavoidable aspect of being human, for example,  while  those  resulting  from  forms  of  oppression,  we  like  to think, are not. The two qualifications added to Cooper's definition serve to exclude two types of normal and normative responses, those arising from avoidable states of affairs, and those that have alternative, socially sanctioned remedies. Depression resulting from unavoidable aspects of being human can be excluded by adding a qualification to the first part of  Cooper's  definition:  diseases  are  bad  things  when  they  are not apparently unavoidable aspects of being human.\n\nSuitably reduced so that it deals only with the affective disorders of concern here, and qualified in the way outlined above, Cooper's account reads:\n\nAffective disorders (diseases) are (1) bad things to have that are not apparently unavoidable aspects of being human ;  when (2) the afflicted persons are unlucky in the sense of feeling or being worse than previously, considering themselves worse  off  than  others  and  or  believing  there  is  a  good  chance  everybody could  be  better  off,  when  this is  not  merely  as  the  result  of  a  violation  of  their human rights; and (3) the affliction can potentially be medically treated and does  not  lend  itself  to  more  obvious,  effective,  socially  sanctioned,  remedies  and  or preventive measures.\n\nThis definition has its own vulnerabilities: the nature of human nature is itself vague and contested; the scope of human rights is similarly open to challenge; and any determination that remedies are socially sanctioned will eventually require further refinement and clarification since it, too, seems  to  rely  on  unsettled  and  contested  norms.  This  reformulation seems to move us some way toward the end we seek. It is still designed for 'diseases' in the traditional sense, however. On the traditional model, affective diseases (or disorders) are understood as the manifestations and effects of an underlying pathological process originating in the individual (at least as a diathesis or risk factor) and characterized by an episodic course or career. Yet some disorders, if not diseases strictly so called,  seem  to  elude  this  framing,  either  by  not  presupposing  a particular  originating  cause  within  the  person  (Post  Traumatic  Stress Disorder  is  an  obvious  example  here)  or  by  not  giving  evidence  of  an episodic course. Dysthymic personality may be one of these exceptions.\n\nA trait  based  depressive personality  disorder, Dysthymia is grouped with  the  family  of  depressive  disorders.  With  its  origins  in  the  earlier trait-based  category of  Neurotic Depression, Dysthymic Disorder is the mildest of depressive disorders, whose diagnosis requires disturbances of mood  and  only  two  additional  symptoms  from  a  disjunctive  set  and whose trait-based and static nature is indicated by the requirement that these  symptoms must  have lasted for some  time (at least  two  years  for adults,  and  one  for  adolescents  and  children).  In  terms  of  severity, Dysthymia  rests  between  major  depressive  disorder  and  the  normal, passing sadness and suffering of everyday life, although it is in DSM-IV placed  on  a  separate  axis  from  other  conditions  in  recognition  of  its status as an unchanging trait cluster.\n\nIn  early  modern  writing  about  melancholy,  the  same  humors  that might  culminate  in  a  severe  disease  condition  gave  rise  to  normal temperamental variations as well. The melancholy man was not ill in any way. His was a fixed tendency to respond more gloomily and sourly than would,  for  example,  the  sanguine  or  choleric  man.  His  traits,  too, resulted from differences in the balance of humors within his body, but\n\nin a tradition harking back to classical times, humoral  character ascriptions such as these were employed without medical connotations. This category of a person of melancholy disposition or temperament is orthogonal to Burton's contrast, introduced earlier, between melancholy as  'Disposition'  and  'Habit.'  The  melancholy  man  was  disposed  to  be 'dull, sad, sour, lumpish, ill-disposed, and solitary' as, from time to time, humans all are. His fixed and long term tendencies were not sufficiently marked to be evidence of the habituated disease state (melancholy the Habit), however.\n\nTypologies of this  kind  and  trait-based  accounts  of  personality  may have less currency today, either in folk psychology and lore, or in more formal  analyses. 3 Yet,  arguably,  the  category  of  a  temperamentally depressive or melancholic personality is one we still recognize and want to  avoid  confusing  with  any  disorder.  It  is  widely  accepted  that,  as Horwitz  and  Wakefield  observe,  there  is  'a  normal  distribution  of intensities  with  which  non-disordered  people  respond  to  stressors' (Horwitz and Wakefield 2007:117). And the basis of those differentiated responses, we can suppose, will include mildly depressive or melancholic temperaments.\n\nIt seems, then, that depressive personality styles and patterns that are relatively stable, and mild, may result either from normal temperamental variation or from whatever underlying states account for dysthymic personality disorder. However, remembering the description of  what  can  seem  to  mimic  the  diagnosis  of  dysthymic  personalitydemoralization and despair as a habituated response to chronic deprivation and persistent loss-we seems must recognize a three part distinction here. Some  personality patterns will reflect habituated responses  to  stressful  lives.  (Although  employing  a  somewhat  limited range  of depressive symptoms,  the  so-called  'learned helplessness' hypothesis  apparently  addresses  this  claim.  Passivity  and  a  failure  to\n\n3  Powerful  critiques  of  the  presuppositions  underlying  trait  theories  include  those  of Mischel 1968, and Ross and Nisbett 1991.\n\nbelieve in oneself, it has been shown, seem to result from being deprived of  opportunities  for  autonomous  action  (Seligman  1975).)  The  trait clusters making  up depressive personality types may  result from underlying  states  of  disorder,  from  normal  temperamental  variation unrelated  to  setting,  or  from  habituated  responses  to  stressful  lives. These  types  may appear indistinguishable.  But  conceptually  they  are separate and there seems reason to maintain that separation.\n\nIn  an  attempt  to  demarcate  disorders  wrought  by  social  stressors, appeal has been made to the notion of a separate 'sustaining' (Gert and Culver) or 'environmental maintaining' (Wakefield) cause, the presence of which betokens not genuine disorder but a normal response to stress. Such a cause is one whose effect will not outlast its continuing stimulus. Only when the suffering originally caused by trauma outlives the trauma (most  notably  in  forms  of  Post  Traumatic  Stress  Disorder),  are  there grounds  for attributing disorder, according to this view.  Stephen Wilkinson has offered a neat definition of a sustaining cause: (a) x is  a cause of c ; (b) x is not part of (i.e., is distinct from) the person with c ; (c) If x were  removed, c would cease to exist almost immediately, i.e., x is necessary  for  sustaining c (Wilkinson  200:301). Wilkinson's  particular focus is the application of the notion of a sustaining cause to distinguish grief  and  mourning  from  pathological  states,  an  effort  he  shows  to  be confounded  by  equivocation  over  the  characterization  of x .  If  what persists is the griever's sense of loss, he points out, then x is not distinct from the person with c . On the other hand, interpreting it as a fact (the fact  of  the  loved  one's  death)  the  truth  of  which  continues  unchanged will lead to highly counter-intuitive conclusions in other cases (Wilkinson 2000:302-3). Granted, this critique may apply with grief and mourning. But other external stressors do seem to function as sustaining causes so defined. In many  instances, we should indeed expect that  when depressive states result from stress, the habituated response to it would be  no  more  than  a  sustaining  cause-ceasing  with  the  cessation  of  the stressor and thus seeming to confirm that here were no ordinary, or at least  no  lasting,  states  of  disorder.  Moreover,  it  might  well  be  that\n\nrecurrent stresses sometimes cause lasting pathological depressive states or dispositions, again conforming to the model in proving themselves to be more than mere sustaining causes.\n\nIn  many  cases  then,  the  sustaining  cause  model  will  allow  us  to separate  pathological  from  normal  and  normative  depressive  traits. Applied  to  our  task  of  demarcating  normal  cases  of  a  habituated numbness  and  dis-spiritedness  resulting  from  external  stressors,  this criterion  comports  with  our  intuitions  only  incompletely,  however.  For we  can  also  envision  cases  where,  once  habituated,  even  normal  and normative responses might outlast their stressors, or result in a lasting, but non-pathological ,  alteration in the temperament of the sufferer. They might transform her from a sunny to a sourer person, for example, or from a light-hearted to a graver one. In this kind of case, the initiating cause is not a mere sustaining cause because its effects outlive it. But the resulting effect is not pathology or disorder; it is normal temperamental or character change.\n\nFew  permanent  character  changes  probably  engender  the  sadder, sourer, more reflective responses we would recognize as melancholic or depressed  (and this,  presumably,  is  fortunate).  Yet,  for  example,  those who  have  witnessed  or  participated  in  great  human  evil  can  seem  so changed. Holocaust survivors sometimes speak this way about themselves or give evidence of such transformation, for example. Those who have come to sincerely repent great and irreparable harm they have wrought do  also.  And  so  sometimes  do  those  whose  belief  in  human  or  divine goodness has been permanently and shatteringly expunged. It may even be that mental disorder itself sometimes leaves a residue of normal long term effects on character. Speaking of earlier episodes of melancholia in the lives of John Bunyan and Leo Tolstoy, Williams James remarks that 'the iron of melancholy left a permanent imprint,' and he does not imply that  the  illness  lingered  but  rather  that  it  was  profound  enough  to permanently change the character of these two men (James 1961:143). The difference between normal and normative responses is evident here: extreme and life changing experiences such as these are too rare for us\n\nto  speak  with  any  confidence  of  the  resulting  character  effects  as expectable .  But  we  certainly  regard  them  as  normative-they  are  fitting and  appropriate  in  light  of  the  experience  or  experiences  undergone. Certain experiences, when sufficiently profound, ought to permanently mark the person, and show in that person's outlook and responses, it is generally  believed.  And  the  person  unaffected  by  such  experiences  is widely deemed shallow, or callow or morally wanting.\n\nThe melancholy or depressive type of character or personality may or may  not  reflect  innate  temperamental  differences,  as  thinkers  from classical  to  early  modern  times  believed.  But  these  examples  seem  to require us to acknowledge normal change that results in such character types. Thus, corresponding to the temporary suffering which is recognized  to  be  a  normal  or  normative  response  to  certain  sorts  of external  stressor  is  permanent  personality  transformation-also  the result of such stressors-that is equally normal and normative. It will be possible  to  add  to  Cooper's  amended  definition  of  affective  disorders (diseases)  to  exclude  the  case  of  normal  temperamental  variation  and these permanent transformations by adapting (1) as follows:\n\nAffective  disorders  (diseases)  are  (1)  bad  things  to  have  that  are  (i)  not apparently unavoidable aspects of being human or the results of (ii) normal temperamental  variation  or  (iii)  character  change  wrought  by  extreme experiences.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThere  seem  reasons  to  maintain  separations  found  in  some  early modern writing, I have argued here. Attributions of depression can and should be distinguished from (i) universal suffering in response to life's vicissitudes;  from  (ii)  normal  temperamental  variation  and  from  (iii) habituated responses and even permanent, non-pathological changes in temperament  resultant  from  painful  and  oppressive  lives.  Until  such time  as  fully  causal  accounts  of  pathological  depression  allow  us  to separate those from  depressive states that  are  more  normal  and normative, we must look toward philosophical definitions that attempt to\n\ncircumscribe those states that reflect pathology, of which Cooper's is one of the most helpful.\n\nUniversity of Massachusetts Boston\n\n## References\n\n| American Psychiatric Association 1994.
