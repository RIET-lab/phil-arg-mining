The premises should logically entail the conclusion.\n2. **Claim**: A proposition that asserts something to be true or false, typically requiring justification or evidence.\n3. **Premise**: A proposition that provides evidence, justification, or logical support for a claim or conclusion.\n\n## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS\n1. **VERBATIM EXTRACTION ONLY**: Each ADU text must be copied EXACTLY from the paper with no modifications, paraphrasing, or combining of separate sentences.\n2. **NO HALLUCINATION**: Do not create, modify, or invent text that does not appear exactly in the source.\n3. **EXACT MATCHING**: Every word, punctuation mark, and spacing must match the original precisely.\n\n## DIRECTIONS\n1. **Identify Argumentative Discourse Units (ADUs)**  \n   - ADU = any contiguous text span functioning as a claim or a premise in the reasoning structure.\n   - **BE HIGHLY SELECTIVE**: Only include ADUs that are crucial to the overarching argument structure.\n   - Focus on significant claims and premises that contribute meaningfully to the argumentative flow.\n   - **AVOID NOISE**: Skip ADUs that are merely descriptive, tangential, or do not substantially advance the argument.\n   - Prioritize quality over quantity - fewer accurate, important ADUs are better than many insignificant ones.\n   - **EXTRACT ONLY**: Copy text spans exactly as they appear, without any modifications.\n2. **Classify each ADU**  \n   - Label = either `\"claim\"` or `\"premise\"`.  \n3. **Detect directed relations**  \n   - Relation = `\"support\"` or `\"attack\"`, from one ADU (source) to another (target).\n   - Map how ADUs connect to form reasoning chains.\n   - Focus on relationships between the most significant ADUs.\n   - Include relationships between premises that strengthen or weaken each other.\n4. **Verbatim spans**  \n   - Each `\"text\"` value must be copied EXACTLY from the paper with zero modifications.\n   - Do not paraphrase, summarize, or combine separate sentences.\n   - Do not add, remove, or change any words, punctuation, or spacing.\n   - If unsure about exact wording, skip that ADU rather than guess.\n\n## WHAT TO CAPTURE\n**INCLUDE ONLY:**\n- Main argumentative threads that are central to the paper's contribution\n- Core claims that represent the paper's primary arguments or findings\n- Key premises that provide essential support for major claims\n- Critical counterarguments and their refutations\n- Reasoning chains that demonstrate how main conclusions are derived\n\n**EXCLUDE (AVOID NOISE):**\n- Minor details, examples, or descriptive content that don't advance the argument\n- Tangential points or side discussions\n- Pure background information or literature review content\n- Methodological details unless they constitute argumentative claims\n- Obvious statements or commonly accepted facts\n- Redundant or repetitive argumentative content\n\n**GUIDING PRINCIPLE**: If removing an ADU would not significantly impact understanding of the paper's argumentative structure, it should be excluded.\n\n## QUALITY CONTROL\n- Before finalizing each ADU, verify the text exists exactly in the source\n- Prefer fewer, accurate ADUs over many potentially modified ones\n- When in doubt about exact wording, omit the ADU\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\nReturn **only** a single valid JSON object matching this schema.  \nDo **not** output any extra text, markdown, or explanations.\nDo **not** add comments.\n**RESPOND WITH ONLY**:\n```json\n{\n  \"ADUs\": {\n    \"<ADU_ID>\": {\n      \"text\": \"<exact span from paper>\",\n      \"label\": \"claim\" | \"premise\"\n    }\n    ...\n  },\n  \"relations\": [\n    {\n      \"source\": \"<ADU_ID>\",\n      \"target\": \"<ADU_ID>\",\n      \"type\": \"support\" | \"attack\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
    "user_content": "## Freedom through Critique: Thoreau's Service to Others\n\nNot  till  we are lost, in  other words, not till we have lost the world, do we bejfin  to find ourselves, and realize  where  we  are  and the infinite extent  of our  relations.\n\n-Thoreau, Walden\n\n[M]ake them  hunters  ...  mighty  hunters  at  last  ...  hunters  as well as fishers of  men.\n\n-Thoreau, Walden\n\nIt  is  no  wonder  that  Thoreau's  detractors  often  see  him  as  antisocial  and nearly  misanthropic.  Throughout Walden, for  example,  he  moves  back  and forth  between  recounting  his  solitary  experiments  in  the  woods  and  sharply critiquing  the  lives  his  contemporaries  lead.  Of  course,  delight  and  optimism shine  through  his  descriptions  of  building  a  house,  taking  walks,  and  bathing in the pond, but his critiques are pointed enough that two intellectual historians  call Walden \"a  diatribe  against  the  life  of  the  village  and  the  farm.\"' Thoreau's  readers  can  justifiably  ask  why  he  returns  so  often  to  writing  about the  meagerness  of other  people's  lives. Why, say, in Walden does  he  repeatedly interrupt  his  account  of  hoeing  beans  to  indict  everyone  else?  If  his  society corrupts its  members  and  nature  is  restorative,  why  not  leave  the society behind and concentrate just on communing with nature.'^ An obvious conclusion  to draw is that  Thoreau  is crankily  focused  as much  on  getting  free from human culture as he is on getting free/or  a better way of living.\n\nIt  is  possible,  though,  to  take  a  more  charitable  view  of  his  critiques  of contemporary  life.  I want  to  suggest  in  this paper  that  they  generally  reflect  an appropriate  and  carefully  designed  approach  to  guiding  his  readers  toward  a way of life  which  he  deems  ideal.^  His  approach  is appropriate  given  what  that way  of  life  is.  To  guide  his  readers  properly  by  his  standards,  Thoreau  has  to emphasize negative freedom at least as much as positive freedom. Concentrating  on  negative  freedom, as  it  is  typically  understood,  we  look backward  at hindrances  to  get  away/row; when  attending  to positive  freedom, we gaze forward toward the better lives that liberation should afford. Ultimately,  though,  Thoreau  levels  his  critiques  in  the  interest  of  getting  us free for what  he  considers  ideal.  First  and  foremost,  his  critiques  represent  an attempt  to perform  a service to other  people.\n\nTransactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society Spring, 2005, Vol. XLI, No. 2\n\nLike  certain  recent  commentators,''  I  read  his writings  here  as  a  revival  of the  traditions  of \"spiritual  guidance\" in  ancient  philosophy,  traditions  he  quite likely  was  familiar  with  in  being  heavily  conversant  with  ancient thought.^ Guidance  in  those  traditions  was  spiritual  not  in  a religious  sense,  but  insofar as  it  was  aimed  at  the  transformation of  the  whole  self.  The  goal  of  selftransformation  was central  to  ancient  philosophy.  In  fact,  \"Ancient  philosophy was, above all, help with life's  problems  and  spiritual  guidance, and  the  ancient philosopher  was, above all, a spiritual  guide [kathe^emon]. Only secondarily namely,  insofar  as  this  was  considered  essential  to  spiritual  guidance  -  was ancient philosophy a theoretical explanation of the world.\"* Cicero, for example  -  whose  writings  Thoreau was  well acquainted with -  offers guidance  in  part  by  setting  himself  up  as  an  exemplar  to  be  imitated (for example, in De ojficiis, 1.22.77). His  choice  to  do so  fits  with  the  ancient view that studying how certain exemplars acted virtuously in particular circumstances can over time  help cultivate in us a capacity to  tell which  actions are  best  in  a given  situation.  As  Cicero  sometimes  does,  Lucretius  often  aims to  have  therapeutic  effects  on  his readers.  For  example, in De rerum  natura -which Thoreau also read -  Lucretius makes his descriptions of war horrifyingly violent  in  ways  that  should  jolt  us  into  recognizing  our  own tendencies  toward  aggression  and  into  reining  them  in.  Ideally,  as a result  our everyday lives will change: taking  up  philosophy, we will spend  each  day  trying \"to  build  affectionate  relationships\"  with  family,  friends,  and  society,  working \"to  limit  and  manage  [our]  own  desires,\"  and  avoiding  the  harm  that  others might inflict  on us.''\n\nThe  paradigmatic  ancient  spiritual  guide  probably  is the  figure  of  Socrates who  appears  in  Plato's  dialogues.*  To  get  a  sense  of  some  often  overlooked aspects  of  his psychagqgia (\"soul-leading\"),  consider  a  move  he  makes  in  the Euthyphro. Upon  asking  Euthyphro  whether  piety  is  what  it  is  because  the gods love it or the gods love it because it is pious, he offers  a series of analogies (lOa-c),  raising  the  question,  for  example,  of  whether  a  seen  thing  is  seen because  someone  sees  it  or  someone  sees  it  because  it  is  seen.  He  does  so simply to try to confuse  Euthyphro and  thereby render  him  more  compliant.\n\nThe  analogies  have  the  logical  force  of a cloud  of  dust in the face.  ...  It is consistent  to claim  that  a seen  thing is  seen  because  someone  sees  it,  a  beloved  thing  is beloved  because  someone  loves  it,  and  piety  is  pious because  the  gods  love  it.  The  multiplicity  of  analogies Socrates  throws  at  Euthyphro,  as well  as  their  lack  of logical  and  persuasive  force,  suggest  that  Socrates  does not intend  a straightforward  refutation  of  Euthyphro.'\n\nRather  than  aiming  at  refutation,  Socrates  employs  rhetoric  since  it  stands  to\n\nbe  a  more  effective means  of  ultimately  leading  Euthyphro  toward  a  life  of examination.\n\nAs  especially  the  examples  of  Lucretius  and  Socrates  should  make  clear, philosophers  in  antiquity  often  used  fmely  honed  rhetorical  devices  to  guide other  people  to  self-transformation and,  in  turn,  certain  ways  of  life.  In  this paper,  I  focus  on  the  extent  to  which  Thoreau  in  related  ways carries  out  \"an act of communication.''''^^ My  main  contribution  is to  point  to  the  importance of  critique  in  his  approach,\"  using  the  concern  about  his  solitariness  as  an occasion  for  exploring  his  mode  of communication.  Responding  below  to  the concern,  I  first  piece  together  his  account  of  how  one  can  genuinely  benefit other  people,  and  I  then  point  to  his  attempts  to  help  others  in  a  way  that coheres with  that  account.  The  discussion  leads into  an  explanation  of why  his critiques are  appropriate.\n\n## /. What People Need Most\n\nIt  takes  only  a  short  search  in  Thoreau's  writings  to  find  rather  biting comments  about  the  culture  that  surrounds  him.  Some  of  them  are  wellknown,  such as his  remark that \"The mass  of  men lead lives of quiet desperation.\"'^  Though  that  line  may  reflect  concern  for  other  people,  he  can seem mainly antipathetic toward them when, for example, he writes, denouncing conformity, that \"The greater number of men are merely corporals,\"^^  when  he  frets  that  \"[W]herever  a man  goes, men  will pursue  and paw him with  their  dirty institutions, and,  if they can, constrain  him  to  belong to their desperate odd-fellow society,\"'*  and  when he cries:  \"Give me  a wildness  whose  glance  no  civilization  can  endure.  ...\"'^  Seclusion  may  appear to  be what  he wants the  most.\n\nIn  line with  what  we  might  thus  expect,  one  of Thoreau's  contemporaries who knew him personally deemed  him a \"consecrated  crank.\"'* Even  Emerson regretted  the  extent  of Thoreau's  solitariness. Early critic James  Russell  Lowell writes  that  Thoreau  \"finds  none  of  the  activities  which  attract  or  employ  the rest  of  mankind  worthy  of  him,\"  and  Robert  Louis  Stevenson  charges  that Thoreau's  \"ruling  passion  was to keep  himself unspotted  from  the  world.\"'^  A more recent critic writes in a similar vein:\n\nThoreau  countered  his  alienation  by  cultivating  what [Erik]  Erikson  calls  a  \"negative  identity,\"  in  which  a tenuous  sense  of  self  is  \"expressed  in  a  scornful  and snobbish  hostility  toward  the  roles  offered as  proper and desirable in one's family or immediate community.\" Acutely sensitive to  Concord's  judgment of him, Thoreau responded by disparaging his townsmen  en  masse  and  defining  himself  by  what  he was not. ... Thoreau never felt himself  -  never\n\nbrushed  up  against  the  distinguishing  contours  of  his being  -  unless  he  had  a  negative  reference  point  for self-affirmation.'*\n\nPerhaps  most  strikingly,  in  a  recent  book  on  Thoreau,  an advocate of  his thought deems him sadly  removed  from  the  social  world  of  other  human beings. In short, Thoreau's vision ... remained communally  myopic  and  thereby  restricted  to  a  world of his own  making. Others were simply not  particularly germane  for  him.  ...  Thoreau  cut  a  sorry  figure. ... [Emerson's  unflattering  appraisal  of  him  after  the  two had  parted  ways]  was  not  solely  the  assessment  of  an antagonist  but  seems  to  have  been  a  general  opinion, one  Thoreau himself  recognized as  widely  held. ... Thoreau reciprocated the quiet hostility of his neighbors. ... [He had] self-centered, asocial inclinations.  ...\"\n\nWhy does  it  make  sense  to  think,  in  spite  of  these  common  impressions,  that Thoreau  tries to perform  a service to other people.'^\"\n\nFirst,  he  suggests  that  he  has a strong  sense  of  responsibility  to  them,  and there is  reason to believe him. Readers are often prone to think he is preoccupied  with  himself,  since  he  can  seem  to  be  heavily  concerned  with refashioning himself  just  for  the  sake  of  his  own  fulfillment. Thoreau  does work  intensely  at  remaking  himself in  order  to  improve  his life.  He  also  seems far  from  immune  to  the  fear  that  he  is  too  self-involved  and  neglects  other people.  In  one  entry  in  his journal,  he writes: \"I  must  confess  I have  felt  mean enough  when  asked  how  I  was  to  act  on  society  -  what  errand  I  had  to mankind.  Undoubtedly  I did  not feel  mean without  a reason.  ...\" Nevertheless, he  immediately adds that \"[Mjy loitering is not without defence.\"^' In explaining  why  in  the  rest  of  the  journal  entry,  he  hardly  denies  having  social responsibilities;  in  fact,  he  suggests  he  is  deeply  committed  to  helping  others: \"I  know  no  riches  I  would  keep  back.  I  have  no  private  good  -  unless  it  be my peculiar  ability  to  serve  the  public.  This  is the  only  individual  property.\"^^ In  another  work,  he  extends  this  invitation:  \"Use  me,  then,  for  I am  useful  in my way, and  stand  as one  of many petitioners  ... supplicating  to  be put  to  my use, if by any means ye may find  me serviceable.  ...\"^^ Thoreau  even goes so far as  to  declare  later  in  his  journal:  \"I  am  not  above  being  used,  aye  abused, sometimes.\"^**  In  the  earlier  journal  entry,  for  example,  he  simply  maintains that  his  \"loitering\"  can  best  prepare  him  for  the  task  of serving  others  -  that he can do the most good  for  them  only by first  enriching  himself  ^ ^\n\nThat  sort  of  claim  surfaces  frequently  in  his  writings.  For  example,  in  a book  review  published  in  the  year  after  he  wrote  the  earlier  journal  entry,  he contends  that  one  must  reform  oneself  in  order  to  reform  society.^*  Elsewhere he insists that  the  best contribution  a citizen can  make to  a community  is not a prudent  vote  at  the  polls  or  change  in  governmental  policy,  but  an  enhanced self ^ ^ In Walden, he  says  that  to  live  harmoniously  with  other  people  \"means to^et  our [own] living  together\" so  that  we  arc  not  a hindrance  to  them;^*  and he  makes  tbe  point  bolder  in  another  essay,  exclaiming  that  the  person  worth the  most  to  others  is the  one  \"who  is  minding his own business'''' in  the  sense not  of  leaving  other  people  alone,  but  of  responsibly  taking  care  to  cultivate personal  strengths.^' Thoreau  leads us to think  that  one of his principal  aims even  especially  in  sculpting  himself  -  is  to  become  as  useful  as  he  can  be  to others.\n\nGranted,  there  are  passages  in  his works  that  can seem  to  strongly  suggest otherwise.  At  one  point, he  writes:  \"I feel  that  my  connection  with  and obligation  to  society  are still  very slight  and  transient.\"'\"  But  such  lines  simply reflect  Thoreau's  rejection  of  conventional  moral  standards,  particularly  those according  to which an action  is charitable.  In  refusing  to follow  them,  he  often speaks  in  an ironic voice,  calling an action \"good\"  when  it  would meet common  expectations  and  \"evil\"  when  it  would  clash  with  them,  and  using terms  such  as 'obligation'  and  'character'  in  line with  how  his society  tends  to use  them.  He  does  so  at  one  point  in Walden, for  example,  when  he  writes: \"As for  Doing-good,  that is one  of the professions  which  are full.  ... Probably I should  not  consciously  and  deliberately  forsake  my particular  calling  to  do  the good which society demands  of me. ...\"^'  Why does he say he should  not?\n\nPhilanthropy,  as  Thoreau calls  it  -  meaning  human  actions  that  are typically considered charitable  -  fails  to  help  other  people  in  the  best  way possible.^^  On  the  one  hand,  philanthropists  may  tend  to  a  person's  physical needs, such  as hunger  or  thirst, or  try  to save the  person  from  physical  danger. But  Thoreau  points  out:  \"I  can  find  you  a Newfoundland  dog  that  will  do  as much.\"''  On  the  other  hand,  a  philanthropist  may  try  to  help  the  poor  feel better  about  themselves  by, say, dressing  them  in more fashionable  clothes  and granting  them  other  luxuries  prized  by  people  who  have  more  money  than they  have.  That  also  is  beside  the  point.  Often  the  poor  are  happy  enough without  such  luxuries,'*  and  even  a  poor  person  who  would  prefer  to  have luxuries is better off without them insofar as they tend just to be encumbrances.'^\n\nPhilanthropists  and  everyone  else  who  goes  about  \"Doing  good\"  -  that is,  who  tries  to  be  of  service  merely  by  following  conventional  standards  of morality  -  may  on balance barm tbe needy person.'* For that reason, philanthropy  even  is  irresponsible.  In  one  of  his  writings,  Thoreau  speaks  to \"My  most  serene  and irresponsible neighbors,\"  saying,  \"let  us see  tbat  we  have the whole advantage  of each  other;  we will  be  useful,  at  least, if not  admirable.\n\nto  one  another.\"'^  One  can  offer  other  people  the  whole  advantage  of  oneself not  by doinÂ£ good,  but  by beinÂ£ good,  as  he  puts  it  -  in  other  words,  by crafting a  rich  life  and  thereby  having  genuine  wealth  to  offer others.'*  In setting  aside  conventional  morality  to  enrich  ourselves  as much  as we  can, we may  not  gain  the  admiration  of  our  neighbors,  but  we  can  end  up  with  a  gift most worth giving  them.''\n\nOn  Thoreau's  account,  the  reason  is  that  everyone  needs  most  of  all  to reach  a  \"solid  bottom,\"  as  he  calls  it.'*\" He  is  not  as precise  here  as we  might want  him  to  be,  but  the  solid  or  \"hard\"  bottom,  in  any case, is what  \"we  can call reality, and  say. This  is,  and  no  mistake.  ...\"*'  When  we  hit  bedrock,  our sense of being in contact vj'wh reality  is so keen and  unshakable  that, for  him, it qualifies  as knowledge.  No  doubt,  this is not  a sort  of knowledge  that  consists of  propositions.  On  one  occasion,  Thoreau  even  says  it  amounts  to  nothing \"more definite than  a  novel  and  grand  surprise  on  a sudden  revelation  of  the insufficiency of  all  that  we  had  called  Knowledge  before.  ...\"''^  Nonetheless, contrary  to  what  he  implies  at  an  earlier  stage  in  his  thinking,  it  is  more  than just  \"a  consciousness  of [one's]  ignorance\"*' - it is also \"[a]n  indefinite  sence [sic] of  the  grandeur  and  glory of the  Universe.  It is the lighting  up of the  mist by  the  sun,\"** illuminating  who  I  am,  what  the  world  is, and  bow  I  stand  in relation  to  it.\n\nThe mist is that which clouds our view of what lies beyond  the  mundane.*^ Accordingly,  in  the  dawn,  our  lives  become  profoundly  meaningful.  Thoreau suggests  as  much  also when,  for  example,  he  promises  almost  hauntingly:  \"If you stand  right  fronting  and  face  to face  to a fact, you will see tbe  sun  glimmer on  both  its surfaces,  as if it were a cimeter,  and  feel  its sweet  edge  dividing  you through  the  heart  and  marrow,  and  so you  will  happily  conclude  your  mortal career. Be  it  life  or  death,  we  crave  only  reality.\"**  Our  craving  reflects  a genuine  need  - in fact,  a need  which  is deepest  and  most  important  to  fulfill, for  not  until  we  have  knowledge  are  we  in  position  to  \"begin,\"  as  he  says.*^ What we can begin to do is live beautifully  and  fully.\n\n## II.  Helping  Others\n\nIf  what  people  need  most  is  the  sort  of  knowledge  just  described,  what, according  to Thoreau, does it take to genuinely  help them.&gt; Consider first  what he says gaining  knowledge  requires. On  his account,  there is no guarantee  that we will  gain  it,  for  we  cannot  bootstrap  our  way to  it,  methodically  following some  clear-cut  procedure.  If  knowledge  comes  to  us  at  all,  it  does  so  only through  \"lieferings  [sudden  revelations]  from  the  gods,\"  he  says*\" -  \"flashes of  light  from heaven.\"*'  It  takes  hold  of  us  more  than  we  take  hold  of  it. Nonetheless, we can be open  or closed  to knowledge  to varying degrees.\n\nIn  the  picture  Thoreau  presents, we are  most  open  to knowledge  when, in a certain respect, we are ignorant.^\" He  does not  mean just that we have to lack understanding  in  order  to  gain  it.  Rather,  the  point  is  that  every  person's\n\noverriding  tendency  is  to  slip  into  mental  \"ruts\"  and,  in  turn,  fall  into  what Thoreau  calls  sleep,  a  condition  in  which  we  are  distracted  to  the  extent  of being  mindless.^* The  more  tightly we  grip what  we  regard  as our  knowledge, the deeper we  sink into habits of unreflective thought;\" inevitably, the familiarity  of  routine  numbs  us  and  lulls  us  into  slumber.  Of  course, what  we regard as our  knowledge  is only ersatz  knowledge, on  Thoreau's  terms, and  in a strict  sense, everyone  who  lacks knowledge  proper  is already  ignorant.  In  the sense  implied  here,  though,  to  be  ignorant  is  to  have  gotten  out  of  one's mental  ruts.\" The  term  'ignorant'  is appropriate  insofar  as freedom  from  habit comes  with  a  price:  our  ersatz  knowledge  lends  us  a  feeling  of  security,  and when jolted  out  of our  comfortable  routines, we  are  left  disoriented.  We  grow \"lost\" - we \"have lost the world\"^* - partly inasmuch  as we no longer  have a handle  on  it  cognitively.  The  experience  is  unsettling,  yet  if  the  shock  of disorientation  awakens  and  sensitizes  us enough  to  ourselves  and  the  universe, we ultimately  become susceptible to its \"grandeur  and  glory\" (the  \"lighting  up of  the  mist  by  the  sun\").  We  are  exposed  and  vulnerable,  but  freer  to  gain genuine  knowledge.^^\n\nIt  is  because  of  what  knowledge  is  that  we  have  to  be  lost  to  gain  it,  as Thoreau  indicates:  \"At  the  same  time  that  we  are  earnest  to  explore  and  learn all  things, we  require  that  all  things  be  mysterious  and  unexplorable, that  land and sea be infinitely wild, unsurveyed and unfathomed by us because unfathomable''' (emphasis  mine).  Though  it  may  seem  odd  for  Thoreau to suggest that we can come  to the solid  bottom  only through  encountering  what is  Mwfathomable,  his  meaning  grows  clearer  when  he  soon  adds:  \"We  need  to witness  our  own  limits  transgressed.  ...\"^* Recall  that  when  I  reach  bedrock,  I am struck  by the  grandeur  and  glory of the universe. To sense its grandeur  and glory,  I  have  to  be  overwhelmed  by  its  vastness  and  depth  -  such  that  I  see my cognitive limits  transgressed.  When  I  do  so,  I  can  fmd  the  universe  great enough to leave my  life  profoundly meaningful. In that sense, infinitude grounds  me.  What  I  fathom  is  the  extent  to  which  the  universe  escapes  my understanding and, in turn, proves to be  extraordinary.\n\nBy getting  and  staying  sufFiciendy  awake  through  escaping  and  avoiding mental  ruts,  one  can  render  oneself  as  amenable  as  possible  to  the  \"sudden revelations\"  through  which  knowledge  comes  to  us.^''  The  most  promising means  of  keeping  out  of  mental  ruts  is  living  \"deliberately,\"  as Thoreau  puts it.^'  To  live  deliberately  is  to  take  possession  of  one's  life  by  being  constantly mindful  of what  one  does  and  why  one  does  it  and  by  thoughtfully  choosing the  ends  one  seeks. Making  thoughtful  choices  requires  genuinely  considering all  options  -  all  directions  in  which  to  \"walk,\"  in  Thoreau's  language.^'  In such  honest  reflection,  we  face  what  he  calls  wilderness  -  foreign,  uncharted territory. There  we can grow lost enough  to gain  knowledge.*\"\n\nWe resist heading toward the wilderness, even though \"a subtle magnetism\"  -  our  craving  for  reality  -  draws  us  there.*'  To  head  in  that\n\ndirection  is to depart from  civilization. Although,  to repeat, we are predisposed to  fixity  in  general,  we  are  especially  inclined  to  get  stuck  since  we  generally \"belong  to  the  community,\"  to  use  Thoreau's  phrase.\"  What  that  means  is that  by failing  to think  for  ourselves, we tend  to  be unduly influenced  by other people and  by what is deemed  \"common sense.\"*^\n\nTake,  for  example,  our  typical  assumption  that  it  is  poindess  to  try  to figure  out  what  is  best,  since  answers  would always  prove  too  elusive.  In programmatic  passages  in Walden., Thoreau  compares  that  assumption  to  the common belief  among  people in nearby  Concord that  Walden Pond is bottomless.  That  belief  itself  is  groundless:  he  says  about  the  pond  that  he \"fathomed it  easily\"  and  found unmistakably  that  it  has  a  bottom.**  But revealingly,  his contemporaries  believe  the  pond  is bottomless  because  \"There have  been  many  stories  told  about  the  bottom,  or  rather  no  bottom,  of  this pond. ...\"*'  The people who  treat those stories as  ftilly  reliable do not investigate  on  their  own  whether  the  pond  has  a  bottom.  Similarly,  to  a large degree  we presume  that  serious  reflection  is pointless  because  it  is rumored  to be and we scarcely think  for  ourselves.\n\nEven if  we  think there may  be  some point in seeking answers,  we commonly  presume  that  it  is  not  logistically  feasible  to  search  in  earnest  that, say, one could  not  earn  an adequate  living while devoting enough  time  to reflection.  We  take  that  for  granted  because  it  seems  to  us  imperative  to  have enough  money to  buy what is widely valued, as Thoreau  laments in Walden:\n\nI  sometimes  try  my acquaintances  by such  tests as this; - who  could  wear  a patch,  or  two  extra  seams  only, over  the  knee.&gt;  Most  behave  as  if  they  believed that their  prospects  for  life  would  be  ruined  if they  should do  it.  It  would  be  easier  for  them  to  hobble  to  town with a broken  leg than with  a broken  pantaloon.  Often if  an  accident  happens  to  a  gendeman's  legs, they  can be  mended;  but  if  a  similar  accident  happens  to  the legs  of  his  pantaloons,  there  is  no  help  for  it;  for  he considers,  not  what  is  truly  respectable,  but  what  is respected.**\n\nOften,  we  even  cling  to  our  ersatz  knowledge  -  whether  it  is  \"common sense\"  or  scientific  expertise  -  because  it  affords  us  a  share  of  our  society's respect.*^ In fact, our lives  overall usually  conform to  what  most people esteem.\n\nIt  is, of course, well-known  that  Thoreau  decries  conformity,  but  I  should emphasize  why, on  his account,  he  does  so, since  his reason  points  to  another key respect  in  which  we  must  lose  the  world.  Aware  that  our  culture  places a premium  on  stylishness,  for  example, we  favor  \"unpatched  clothes\"  even  over\n\nhaving  \"a  sound  conscience.\"*^  In  doing  so, we  become  not  simply  beholden to  other  people,  but  enslaved  to  them.  Slavery,  Thoreau  writes,  \"is  not  the peculiar  institution  of  the  South.  It  exists  wherever  men  are  bought  and  sold, wherever  a  man  allows  himself  to be  made  a  mere  thing  or  a  tool,  and surrenders his inalienable  rights of reason and  conscience. Indeed,  this  slavery  is more  complete  than  that which  enslaves the  body  alone.\"*'  Much  as  Emerson calls  for  self-reliance,  declaring,  for  example,  that \"[limitation  is  suicide,\"''\" Thoreau  urges  his reader  to  be  independent:  \"Every  path  but  your  own  is  the path  of  fate.  Keep  on  your  own  track,  then.\"'''  The  fate  we  risk  suffering  is nothing  less  than  to  miss  out  on  living  while  staying  fast  asleep.''^  After  all, whenever  we  have  surrendered  our  faculties  of  critical  discernment  and  selfgovernment, we are ill-equipped  to get out  of our  mental  ruts so as to  awaken. In  thinking  for  ourselves,  we  gain  our  soul  and  are  in  position  to  lose  the world  in  the  sense  of growing  disoriented.  There  again  is a cost,  since  we  lose the  world  in  an  additional  respect:  we  forfeit  the  comfort  and  commendation that come with belonging to the community;  when we head into the wilderness,  we  ourselves  grow  wild  to  a  certain  extent.^'  Nevertheless,  losing the  world  in  this additional  respect  allows  us to  ultimately  lose it in  the  former sense of growing  disoriented.\n\nAccordingly,  Thoreau  suggests  that  to  genuinely  help  other  people,  one must  free  them  from  the  community  so  that  they  each  can  follow  their  own paths.  Philanthropy,  for  example,  often  does  more  harm  than  good  because  it stems  from  the  view  that  people  are  urgendy  needy  when  they  lack  what  the community esteems, so philanthropy tends to convey or reinforce the assumption that  what  the community  esteems  most  highly  really  is  most important. That is why Thoreau says that the \"example\" that the philanthropist  sets  for  the  needy  generally  \"leaves  them  far  behind. ...  You boast  of  spending  a  tenth  part  of  your  income  in  charity;  may  be  you  should spend  the  nine  tenths so, and  done  with  it.\"^* If I gave up  my wealth  and  took up  a  life  of  \"voluntary  poverty,\"^^  I  would  strike  \"at  the  root\"  of  human problems  instead  of  merely  \"hacking  at  the  branches\"^*  -  for  my  actions would  reflect  the  conviction  that  luxuries  and  prestige  hardly  matter  most,  and I  could  serve  as an exemplary  model  of an individual  who finds his own way.  It is in  that  regard  that  I would  \"6e good,\"  to  use Thoreau's  language, instead  of just  \"doing  good.\"  As he  urges  us  to  do,  I  would  \"spend  [my]self,\"^^  instead of  just  my  money  and  time,  on  helping  other  people:  I  would  enrich  myself insofar  as  I  regained  and  cultivated  my  independence,  and  by  doing  so,  I would  help other  people  far  more  than  by, say, tending  to  their  physical  needs or  helping them  look more  fashionable.^*\n\n## III.  Thoreau as Exemplar\n\nGiven  that  Thoreau  claims  all  this,  we  can  understandably  expect  him  to try  to  serve  as  that  sort  of  exemplar,  and  the  fact  that  he  does  so  suggests,  in\n\npart, that  he is, indeed, driven  to enrich  other  people  by freeing  them  from  the community.  To  argue  that  his  actions  cohere  with  his  claims  about  what  it takes to  genuinely  help others, I want  to point  to  two examples  of his  attempt to  unveil  an  ideal  through  his  own  life  -  an  attempt  which  is somewhat  like Cicero's  and  other  ancient  philosophers'  efforts to  model  virtue.  Since  the examples involve certain essays  Thoreau wrote -  namely, Walden and \"Resistance  to  Civil  Covernment\"  (or,  \"Civil  Disobedience\")  -  I should  first say a bit about the approach  I take  here.\n\nAfter  all, in  his writings  Thoreau  clearly  enough  means  to  offer  more  than just  a literal  record  of  his choices  and  experiences.  In Walden., for  example,  he himself  acknowledges that he puts \"the best face on the matter.\"^' In \"Resistance  to  Civil  Government,\"  he  explains  in  rather  grand  and  dramatic terms  that  he  was arrested  and  spent  a night  in  jail  for  refusing  to  pay  certain taxes,  and  that  he  refused  in  part  because  he  believed  the  government  had acted unjustly in  imprisoning  Native  Americans,  black  fugitive slaves,  and prisoners  of  the  current  war  with  Mexico.  Yet  no  doubt,  Thoreau's  refusal  to pay  certain  taxes  in  July  of  1846  was  not  as  daring  or  extraordinary  as  his account  in  the essay  can  lead  readers  to  think.  About  three  years earlier, Bronson  Alcott  and  later  one  of  his  friends  had  been  arrested  when  they  each had  made  the  same  political  gesture,  and  upon  their  arrests  one  of  Concord's most  prominent  citizens  had  paid  their  taxes  for  them  so  that  they  had  soon been  released.  The  constable  who  arrested  Thoreau,  Sam Staples, even  tried  to spare  him from  jail, offering  to pay his taxes for  him.\n\nDespite  how  relatively  tame  Thoreau's  venture  into  activism  was, at  some point  before  Staples  tried  to  release  him  from  his cell  in  the  morning  Thoreau apparendy  had  come  to  hope  the  incident  would  end  up  being  an  instructive exhibition  for  other  people.  When  Staples  told  him  he  was  to  be  released, Thoreau  grew furious:  he wanted  to  be kept  in jail  longer so that  his arrest  and confmement  would  be  more  striking  to  observers.  Since  the  reason  he  was  to be  released  was  that  someone  had  paid  his  taxes  for  him  after  his  arrest,  he insisted  that  he  should  have  to  stay  in  jail  since  it  was  not  he  who  had  paid.\"\" So  in any  case,  it is  not surprising that in crafting \"Resistance to Civil Government,\"  for  example, he used  the  \"facts\"  of his life  \"only  ... as the  frame to  my pictures,\"  to  quote  from  a comment  he  offers  elsewhere  about  his work in  general  - that  is, he  made  them  \"material  to  the  mythology  I am  writing,\" one  which  was  supposed  to  influence  other  people.*'  To  gauge  whether  his actions  line  up  with  his claims  about  what  it  takes  to  genuinely  help  others,  it makes  the  most  sense  to  look  at  what  the  mythology  consists  of  and,  in  turn, reveals  its  specific  purpose  to  be;  for  constructing  such  a  mythology  is just  as much  an  action  as, say,  engaging  in  political  activism  is, and  Thoreau,  in  fact, treated  the  former  sort  of action  as  more  important  in  his case  than  the  latter sort.  Granted,  there  is fairly solid  evidence  that,  for  example, he often  served as a  conductor  on  the  Underground  Railroad  and  went  to  considerable  lengths\n\nto  help  black  fugitive  slaves;  yet  what  he  mainly  devoted his  life  to  is  not activism,  but  writing  -  even  though  it  was  by  no  means  his  main  source  of income. Consider, then, two pictures he paints.\n\nFirst,  especially  in Walden, he  depicts  his life  as centered  on  philosophical examination.  In  explaining early in Walden why he went  to the woods - what his chief  motivation  was -  he  says that  he wanted  \"to  front  only  the  essential facts  of life, and  see if I could  not  learn what  it  had  to teach  ... and, if it proved to  be  mean, why  then  to  get  the  whole  and  genuine  meanness  of it  ...  or  if it were  sublime,  to  know  it  by  experience.  ...\"^^  He  identifies  his  endeavor  as philosophical  in  the  fullest  sense: it  entails  loving  wisdom  so  much  \"as  to  live according  to  its  dictates\"  and  solving  \"some  of  the  problems  of  life,  not  only theoretically,  but  practically.\"\"  Thoreau  lives  by  wisdom's  dictates  insofar  as he  does  what  it  takes  to  be  in  position  to  gain  knowledge.  For  example,  he tries  to  make  himself  more  amenable  to  lieferings  (sudden revelations)  by \"simplifying\"  his life in the sense of clearing away distractions.** It is  significant that  the  title  of  the  first  chapter  of Walden is  \"Economy\"  and  that  he  laments in  that  chapter  that  \"Even  the poor student  is  taught  only political economy, while  that  economy  of  living which  is synonymous with  philosophy [emphasis mine]  is  not  even  sincerely  professed in  our  colleges.\"*^  He  views  even  his logistical simplification of  life  as  fundamentally and  wholly  philosophical.** Inasmuch  as his project  thus  embodies  the  ancient  Greek  and  Roman view that wisdom  is  an  understanding  of  how  to  live  a  life  that  is  good to live,  it represents a return  to philosophy's roots.*^\n\nThoreau  not  only  claims  to  center  his  life  on  philosophical  examination, but  also  urges  other  people  to  take  up  examined  lives.  His  call  for  everyone else to  privilege  examination  is especially loud  when, for  example, he  exclaims: \"Let  us  spend  our  lives  in  conceiving  then.\"**  For  that  matter,  he  can  even seem  to  take  on  a  sharply  moralistic  tone  when  in  bewailing  in  another  work the  coming  loss of wild apples  and  warning  that  domesticated  apples  are  poor substitutes,  he  invokes  condemnatory  lines  from  the  Old  Testament,  such  as the following: \"Be ye ashamed, O ye  husbandmen! howl, O ye vinedressers!  ...  the  apple-tree,  even  all  the  trees  of  the  field,  are  withered.\"\"  That is  relevant  here  for  at  least  two  reasons.  For  one,  he  celebrates  wildness  and suggests  that  serious  reflection  is integral  to  maximizing  it.'\"  For  another,  the wild  apples  that  grow  near  Concord  -  like Thoreau  - have  \"strayed  into  the woods  from  the  cultivated  stock,\"  and  yet  are  \"most  civilized\"  in  a  certain regard.\"\n\nLet  me  turn  now  to  \"Resistance  to  Civil  Government.\"  Contrary  to  what we  might  expect, Thoreau  writes  in  this essay that  he  does  not  aim  to  win  the support  of  a  majority  of  his  fellow  citizens  for  the  cause  of  emancipating  the Native  Americans,  black  fugitive  slaves, and  prisoners  of  the  current  war  with Mexico  who  reside  in  American  jails. The  reason  he  gives  is  illuminating:  \"A wise  man,\"  he  says,  \"will  not ...  wish  to  prevail  through  the  power  of  the\n\nmajority,\"  since  \"There  is but  little  virtue  in  the  action  of  masses of men.'\"^  If it  mattered  most  to  him  to  see  Native  Americans,  black  fugitive  slaves,  and Mexicans  released,  he  could  work  through  the  judicial  system  or  adopt  other \"ways that the State  has provided  for  remedying  the  evil,\"\" but  in the  essay he says he  also rejects  that  option.  Here  again  his reason  is telling:  \"I  have  other affairs  to  attend  to.  I  came  into  this  world,  not  chiefly  to  make  this  a  good place  to  live  in,  but  to  live  in  it,  be  it  good  or  bad.\"'*  His  main  responsibility, to  repeat,  is  not  to do good, but  to  be  good by  living  richly.  He rebuffs \"philanthropy\" in the essay,  as  he  does  elsewhere,  again  trumpeting the importance  of \"giv[ing  one]self entirely to  [one's] fellow-men\"  instead  of \"giv [ing one]self partially to  them.\"'^\n\nThere  is  no  question  that  in  his  writings,  Thoreau  acknowledges  that  he thinks  black  slaves  and  Mexican  and  Native  American  prisoners  should  be  set free.  He  even  says  in Walden that  he  \"helped  to  forward  to  the  northstar\"  a \"real  runaway slave.\"'* But  again,  his claim  is that  the  sort  of  slavery  in  which \"a  man  allows  himself  to  be  made  a  mere  thing  or  a  tool,  and  surrenders  his inalienable  rights of reason and conscience\" is \"more  complete than  that which enslaves the  body alone.\"\"' When  in Walden he reports  that he  helped  to free a runaway  slave,  apparently  meaning  someone  who  was  fleeing  the  Southern institution  of  black  slavery, he  does  so in  a context  in which  he  also writes,  for example,  that citizens \"have become  the  tools  of  their  tools\";  that he  is inclined  to think  they  \"are  not  so much  the  keepers of herds as herds are\" their keepers; that  \"We do  not  ride  upon  the  railroad; it rides upon  us\"; and  that  \"I sometimes  wonder  that  we  can  be  so  frivolous,  I  may  almost  say, as to  attend to  the  gross  but  somewhat  foreign  form  of  servitude  called  Negro  Slavery, there  are  so  many  keen  and  subtle  masters  that  enslave  both  north  and  south. It  is  hard  to  have  a southern  overseer;  it  is worse  to  have  a northern  one;  but worst  of all when  you  are  the  slave-driver  of yourself \"'*  Physical  bondage  and enslavement  are bad, he maintains, but  the  people who need  the  most  help are those who  have surrendered  their  \"reason  and conscience\" to  the  community's dictates which they have  internalized.\n\nWhat  he writes  in  \"Resistance  to  Civil  Government\"  reflects  that  idea. As he portrays them, taxpayers outside of  jail are less free than the Native Americans,  black  fugitive  slaves, and  Mexican  soldiers  in jail  are. To  pay  taxes to a  government which behaves unjustly is to be complicit with that government  and  thus to  \"resign  [one's]  conscience  to  tbe  legislator.\"\"  It  is to be  a slave  -  or,  a  \"subject,\"  as he  puts  it  here,  observing:  \"The  mass  of  men serve  the  State  thus,  not  as  men  mainly,  but  as  machines.  ...\"\"\"'  For  certain reasons, people who are in jail can  be  much  freer  than  subjects  are. For  one, in an  obvious  respect  prisoners  have  often  landed  in  jail  to  begin  with  as a result of  retaining  and  exercising  their  capacities  for  self-government.  Many  fugitive slaves, for  example,  refused  to  ascribe  authority  to  laws  which  forbid  them  to flee.\n\nMore  important,  from  jail  I  can  see  the  world  far  more  clearly,  growing more  inclined  to  reclaim  my  autonomy.  In  being  put  in  jail,  I  may  directly experience  some  of the  injustice  that  my government  commits; as a result,  my consciousness  of  the  need  to  combat  the  injustice  can  be  heightened,  and  my resolve to  combat  it  can be  strengthened.\"\" Further, I  am  likely  to feel distanced  from the  government  which  put  me  in  jail  and  from  the  culture which  is  complicit  with  that  government;  accordingly,  I  can  view  the  world afresh.  Consider  part  of Thoreau's  description  of  his time  in jail, which  here is worth  quoting at length:\n\nIt  was  like  traveling  into  a  far  country,  such  as  I  had never  expected  to  behold, to  lie there  for  one  night.  It seemed  to  me  that  I  never  had  heard  the  town-clock strike  before,  nor  the evening sounds  of the village; for we  slept  with  the  windows  open,  which  were  inside the  grating.  It  was  to  see  my  native  village  in  the  light of the  middle ages, and  our  Concord  was turned  into a Rhine  stream, and  visions of knights and  castles passed before  me. They were the voices of old  burghers that  I heard  in  the  streets.  I was an  involuntary  spectator  and auditor  of  whatever  was  done  and  said  in  the  kitchen of  the  adjacent  village-inn,  -  a  wholly  new  and  rare experience  to  me.  It  was  a  closer  view  of  my  native town.  I  was  fairly  inside  of  it.  I  never had  seen  its institutions before.'\"^ This is one of its peculiar institutions; for it is a shire town. I began to comprehend  what its inhabitants were  about.'\"'\n\nIn  a  critical sense,  one  can  get  freer by  going  to  jail.  In  fact,  it  is  highly significant that in Walden, Thoreau  rather  fondly  recounts  his  time  in  jail immediately after  emphasizing the importance  of having  \"lost the  world.\"'\"*\n\nIn  line  with  those  claims, the  chief concern  that  emerges  in  \"Resistance  to Civil  Government\"  is  to  liberate  the  mass  of  taxpayers  who  mindlessly  serve the  State  and,  in  turn, sleep  through  their  lives. In  the  essay, Thoreau  presents his opposition  to  slavery and  the current  war  with  Mexico as just  occasions  for his  opposition  to  the  government;  for  the  main  question  he  addresses  is this: given that  he is at  odds with  the  majority  of his society, what should  he  choose to  do.* His  answer,  of  course,  is that  he  has  a  genuine  obligation  to  carry  out what  he  thinks  is  right,  and \"[A]ny  man  more  right  than  his  neighbors, constitutes  a  majority  of  one  already.\"'\"^  In  other  words,  he  must  follow  his own path without  depending  upon  others  to validate  it. That  is the core of  the reason  he  gives  for  refusing  to  pay  certain  taxes  -  and  he  maintains  that  it  is best  for all citizens  to  break  ties  with  an  unjust  government  in  the  way  he\n\nhas. 106\n\nIn  fact,  Thoreau  also  suggests  the  most  pressing  need  is  for them to  get free,  for  he pivotally declares that  even ii just  ''one HONEST man, in this State of  Massachusetts, ceasing to hold slaves., were  actually  to  withdraw  from [his] copartnership  [with  the  government],  and  be  locked  up  in  the  county  jail therefor,  it  would  be  the  abolition  of  slavery  in  America.\"'\"^  At  first,  it  may seem  that  the  reason  it  matters  most  whether  citizens  resist  the  government  is that  they  have  the  most  power  to  reform  it.  But  Thoreau,  as  he  emphasizes, refers  here  to just  \"-one HONEST  man,\"  and  his  promise  in  the  essay  is  that the  government  would  have to mend  its ways at least somewhat  if the  number of  conscientious citizens  who  refused to  pay  taxes  grew  large  enough to burden  the government.  How  could  it help, then, for just one person  to  go  to jail  for  refusing  to  pay  taxes?  Thoreau  must  mean  that  as a citizen  who  took  a stand  against  the  majority  of other  citizens, I could  escape  my own  slavery.  He indicates as much  even  more  clearly in writing  a few pages earlier, for  example, that  when  eventually  a  majority  of  citizens  abolish  slavery  with  their  votes, ''They will  then  be  the  only  slaves.  Only his vote  can  hasten  the  abolition  of slavery  who asserts his  own  freedom [emphasis  mine] by  his  vote.\"'\"'  On Thoreau's  account,  taking  a  stand  against  the  majority  would  not  necessarily preclude me  from reforming the  government,  since  enough  other  citizens might  join  me  in  my  stand,  reclaiming  their  own  autonomy.  The  main  point, though,  is  not to  reform the  government,  but  to  be  free  from the  most pernicious  kind  of  slavery  -  that  in  which  one  abnegates  one's  \"reason  and conscience.\" Thoreau  would  incite me to withhold  tax money and go to jail  to get myself  freer.\n\nSo  in  the  picture  he  presents  in  \"Resistance  to  Civil  Government,\"  he refuses  to  pay  certain  taxes  both  to  preserve  his  capacity  for  self-government and  to  ultimately  provoke  his readers to  recover  their  autonomy,  acting  on  the notion  that  it  is  the  autonomous  individual  who  can  be  of  genuine  service  to others.  In  the  passage  in which  he claims that just \"one HONEST man\"  could bring  about  \"the  abolition  of slavery in America,\"  he  even  adds:  \"For  ...  what is once  well  done  is done/or  ev^r\"\"\"  Quite  significandy,  that  reference  to  the everlasting  ties  into  an  important  theme  in Walden, among  other  essays  he writes. There  he  says that  \"In  any weather,  at  any  hour  of  the  day  or  night,  I have  been  anxious  to improve  the  nick  of time  ...\",  and  that  \"That  time  which we  really  improve,  or  which is  improvable,  is  neither past,  present, nor future.\"''\"  What  really  matters,  he  suggests  in  those  lines  and  surrounding passages, is to  improve  our  relation  to  the  eternal  -  to  enhance  the  extent  to which  we  are  free  enough  to  come  to  stand  firmly  on  the  infinitude  of  the solid  bottom  which  renders  one's  life  profoundly  meaningful.  Everything  else - what  we  own,  enslavement  or  imprisonment  of  the  body,  the  state  of  the government  -  matters  just  insofar  as  it  affects  whether  we  are  free  in  that respect.'\"  Thoreau's  \"proper  work,\"  as he  calls it,\"-^ thus centers  on  following\n\nhis  own  path  and,  in  turn,  spurring  other  people  to  follow  theirs. The  project of  reforming the  government  and  improving  other  features  strictly  of  our \"temporal\"  existence  comes  only  after  the  task  of  enhancing  our  relation  to the  eternal.\n\nHe acts consistently with  that idea in crafting  all his writings, even  \"Slavery in Massachusetts\" and other essays that follow \"Resistance to Civil Government\"  and  are  commonly  thought\"^  to  mark  a  shift  in  his  focus.  In \"Slavery  in  Massachusetts,\"  for  example,  penned  when  fugitive  slave  Anthony Burns  had  been  returned  to  Virginia  under  the  1851  Fugitive  Slave  Law  and antagonism  between  North  and  South  was  steadily  growing,  Thoreau  can sound  far  angrier  about  \"enslavement  of the  body,\"  and  he writes such  lines as the  following:\n\n[M]y old  and  worthiest  pursuits  have  lost  I cannot  say how  much  of  their attraction, and I feel that  my investment  in  life  here  is worth  many  per  cent,  less  ... No  prudent  man  will  build  a stone  house  under  these circumstances,  or  engage in any  peacefiil enterprise which  it  requires  a  long  time  to  accomplish.  ...  life  is more  interrupted  and  less  available  to  a  man's  proper pursuits.\"*\n\nIt  might  seem  as  if  here  he  revokes  his  claim  that  reaching  a  solid  bottom matters  most.  But  while  his  attention  does  shift  somewhat  in  light  of  recent events, the claim about the  paramount importance of  knowledge stands securely  intact.  In  fact,  Thoreau  suggests  that  what  so  troubles  him  about  the government's  recent  misdeeds  and  the  very  reason  they  demand  attention  is that  they  impede  proper  work.  \"I  walk  toward  one  of our  ponds,\"  he  grieves, \"but what signifies the beauty of nature when men are base? ...  The remembrance  of my country  spoils  my walk.\"\"^  The  problem  with  the  return of  Anthony  Burns  to  enslavement  is  that  \"[T]o  some  extent,  the  State  has fatally  interfered  with  my  lawful business.  ...  it  has  interrupted  me  and  every man on  his onward  and  upward  path.  ...\"\"* Thoreau's  lawful  business of  freely following his  own  path involves at times helping others escape physical enslavement. So as one critic comments, the  \"underlying  rationale  for  protest\" in  the  essay  \"rests  on  Thoreau's  outrage  that  his  own  freedom ha[s]  been compromised  -  not  that  of  Burns!\"\"''  The  present  situation needs  to  be remedied  so that it will be possible  again  to follow  one's  path  unhindered.\n\nNonetheless,  referring  in  a  closing  paragraph  to  his  rightful  pursuits  that lead  him  into  nature,  Thoreau  adds  that  \"I  shall  not  so  soon  despair  of  the world  for\"  the  white  water-lily  that  symbolizes  purity,\"*  and  he  continues  his proper work  to some extent, prompting others to reclaim their autonomy  as he exercises  his.  In  the  essay,  he  echoes  principal  themes  found  in  \"Resistance  to\n\nCivil Government,\" stressing that the individual who  is  right has  more authority  than  the  errant  majority  does;  invoking  the  notion  of  one's  relation to  eternity;  calling  for  \"each  inhabitant  of  the  State  [to]  dissolve  his  union with  her,  as long  as she  delays  to  do  her  duty\";  maintaining  that  what  matters is  not  which  votes  are  cast,  but  what the  character  of  each voter  is;  and insisting  that  \"What  should  concern  Massachusetts  is  not  the  Nebraska  Bill, nor  the  Fugitive  Slave Bill, but  her  own  slaveholding  and  servility.\"'\"  Though still  somewhat  impeded,  Thoreau's  proper  work  carries  over  even  into  such later  essays  as the  ones  he  writes  on  John  Brown.  Not  only  is Brown  militant against  the  evils that  hinder  Thoreau  on  his onward  and  upward  path,  but  also Brown's  heroism,  on  Thoreau's  terms, lies to  a substantial  degree  in  his  \"arch individualism,\" to quote  another  commentator:\n\n[For  Brown]  God's  favorite number  is  the  number one:  one  righteous  man.  ...  [Brown]  imagined  \"one bold  and  to  some  extent  successful  man  ...  defending his  rights  in  good  earnest,\"  then  being  put  on  \"trial for  life,\"  finally  to  be  \"hanged,  if  [he]  must,\"  all  of which  would \"arouse ...  sympathy throughout the nation,\"  for  \"nothing  so  charms  the  American  people as personal  bravery.\"  ...  Brown's  style  ...  was  to  work alone  and  in  secret,  never  showing  any  interest,  for example, in working with others involved in the struggle  to  make Kansas a Free-Soil state.'^^\n\nSo  in  praising  Brown,  Thoreau  in  large  part  reemphasizes  the  importance  of the autonomous  individual.\n\nIn  short,  his actions overall  cohere  with  his claim  that  the  best way to  help others,  is  to  enrich  oneself.  First  and  foremost,  he  propounds  a  mythology which is geared  to incite  his readers to reclaim  and preserve their  autonomy.  In Walden, for example, he depicts his life as centered on philosophical examination,  calling  for  others  also  to  take  up  examination  in  spite  of  the \"commonsensical\"  view  that  it  is  futile. Similarly,  in \"Resistance to Civil Government,\"  he profiles  his stand  against  the  majority,  recounting  his  refusal to pay taxes and urging his readers also to break ties with an unjust government.  In  key part,  he  performs  his  service  to  others  by  trying  to  be  an exemplary  model  of  an  individual  who  is  not  a slave  or  subject,  following  his own path.\n\n## IV.  Dimming the Lodestar\n\nAt  this  point,  a  question  arises,  and  it  is  pivotal  since  it  leads  toward  the reasons  that  Thoreau's  critiques  are  appropriate.  In  line with  the  idea  that  it is vital  never  to  be  a slave  or  subject  by  abnegating  one's  reason  or  conscience.\n\nhe  makes such  disclaimers  as this:  \"I  do  not  mean  to  prescribe  rules  to  strong and  valiant  natures,  who  will  mind  their  own  affairs  whether  in  heaven  or hell...  .\"'^^  But  does  he  not  presume  to tell us what we should  do.&gt; As I  remark above,  he  maintains  that  examination  is best  for  everyone, and  he  says  that  all taxpayers ought  to  dissolve  ties with  an  unjust  government.  Of course, perhaps he  means  to  prescribe  rules  only  to  natures  who  are not \"strong  and  valiant.\" Yet  he  is eager  to  stress:  \"I  would  not  have  any  one  adopt my mode  of  living on  any  account.  I  would  have  each  [person]  be  very  careful  to  find  out  and pursue his own way,  and  not  his  father's  or  his  mother's  or  his  neighbor's instead.\"'^^  How  are we to account for  this apparent  inconsistency?\n\nConsider  first  the  importance  of exaggeration  or extravagance  in  Thoreau. I  have  already  noted  that  he  writes  mythologies,  instead  of just  literal  records of his choices and  experiences, but  there is more  to add.  In  a long passage  near the  end  of Walden, he  salutes ''Â·Extra va^anceF, confessing:  \"I  fear  chiefly  lest my expression  may  not  be extra-  vacant enough,  may  not  wander  far  enough beyond  the  narrow  limits  of  my  daily  experience,  so  as  to  be  adequate  to  the truth of  which I  have  been  convinced. ...  I  am  convinced that I  cannot exaggerate  enough  even  to  lay  the  foundation  of  a  true  expression.\"'\"  That sentiment  is  not  isolated  in  his  writings.  For  example,  near  the  beginning  of \"Walking,\"  he writes: \"I  wish  to  make  an  extreme  statement.  ...\"'^''  Relatedly, observing  in an essay  published earlier that author Thomas  Cariyle  gives exaggerated accounts of figures in history, Thoreau makes a revealing pronouncement:\n\nExaggeration!  was ever  any  virtue  attributed  to  a  man without exaggeration? was ever any vice, without infinite  exaggeration?  Do  we  not  exaggerate  ourselves to  ourselves,  or  do  we  recognize ourselves for the actual  men we are? Are we not  all great  men? Yet what are  we  actually  to  speak  of)  We  live  by  exaggeration, what  else  is  it  to  anticipate  more  than  we  enjoy?  The lightning  is  an  exaggeration  of  the  light.  Exaggerated history  is poetry,  and  truth  referred  to  a new  standard. To  a  small  man  every  greater  is  an  exaggeration. He who cannot  exaggerate  is  not  qualified to  utter truth. No  truth  we  think  was  ever  expressed  but  with  this sort  of  emphasis, so  that  for  the  time  there  seemed  to be no ' ^ ^\n\nBy the  \"new  standard\"  of  truth  which  Thoreau  mentions  here,  \"It  takes  two to  speak  the  truth,\"  as  he  claims  elsewhere,  \"  -  one  to  speak,  and  another  to hear.\"'^*  The  reason  is  that  the  account  I  offer  you  is  true  only  insofar  as  it conduces  to  your  improvement.  In  that  respect,  to  utter  truth  is  to  \"speak  a\n\n^00^ word,\" in Thoreau's  languagc.'^^ It is to  draw other people  toward  better lives.'^Â«\n\nWhy, according to Thoreau, does one have to exaggerate or be extravagant in order to meet  the new  standard.' On  the  one hand, true accounts  are  extravagant relative  to the  norms  of  the  community  to  which those  people  typically  belong.'^'  According  to  those  norms,  statements  must be  determinate.\"\"  But  knowledge,  as Thoreau  portrays  it,  cannot  be  signified in  definite  terms.  (Hence,  he  asks in  the  passage  quoted  above fi-om the  essay on Thomas  Carlyle:  \"Yet  what  arc  we  actually  to  speak  of&gt;\")  The  most meaningful experience is private enough that it may be even wholly incommunicable.'^'  We  can  witness  to  the  sense  with  which  it  leaves  us,  but our  ability  to  evoke  the  same  sense  in  other  persons  is  profoundly limited. Anyone  who  is  awake  enough to sense the \"glory and grandeur of  the Universe\"  will  appreciate the  extent to  which  determinate  expressions  are inadequate  to  represent  it.'^^ To  everyone  else who  listens, though,  statements which are true and  thus, by necessity, indefinite  are  extravagant.'^^\n\nOn  the  other hand,  most  sleepers  scarcely  hear  what  one  says.  Only \"shouting\" can get the message across to them.'^* While drowsiness still clouds their  vision  and  they  see  nothing  beyond  their  trivial  concerns,  someone  else must  prompt  them  to set  their  sights  higher  if they  are  to  have  much  hope  of waking  up.  To  point  their  vision high  enough,  one has  to exaggerate.'^' Thomas  Carlyle,  for  example,  \"creates  you  an  ideal  hero\"  only  by  giving  an exaggerated  account  ofa  historical  figure's  merits.''* Nonetheless,  his  account is  true  inasmuch  as  it  can  help  improve  other  people  by  presenting  an  ideal worth  aspiring to.\n\nThoreau  thus  claims  that  one  must  be  able  to  exaggerate  in  order  to  be qualified to utter truth.  His  claim  may  seem  straightforward enough.  But notice a crucial  implication  of it. Since it comes from  him, it makes sense for  us to  suspect  that  he  himself  exaggerates.  As  if  to  heighten  our  suspicion,  he chooses strong wording in, for example, a passage quoted  above from  the essay on Thomas Carlyle: \"was ever any virtue attributed to a  man without exaggeration.'  was ever any  vice, without infinite exaggeration.'  ... Are  we  not all great men.'\"  (emphasis  mine).  Moreover,  in  \"Walking\"  and Walden, he explicitly says that he aims  to make  extreme  and  extravagant claims,  and elsewhere,  mentioning  \"exaggerations,\"  he  exclaims:  \"I  have  no  respect  for facts  even  except  when I  would use  them,  and for the most  part I  am independent  of  those  which  I  hear,  and  can  afford to  be  inaccurate,  or,  in other  words, to  substitute  more  present  and  pressing  facts  in  their  place.\"'^^  If people  warn  us that  they  are  likely to  exaggerate, we  have  good  reason  to  put much  less stock  in  whatever  they  say,  or  at  least  to  take  whatever  they  say  far more cautiously. We, of course, have good  reason  to take cautiously even  their claim  that  one  has  to  be  able  to  exaggerate  in  order  to  be  qualified  to  utter truth.  Thoreau  seems  well  aware  of  that  principle  and  of  the  effect he  can\n\naccordingly  have  in  vowing  to  exaggerate.  Near  the  end  of  a  10  April  1853 letter  to  Harrison  Blake  in  which  he  makes  bold  proclamations,  he  writes:  \"I trust  that  you  realize  what  an  exaggerator  I  am,  -  that  I  lay  myself  out  to exaggerate whenever I have an  opportunity., - pile  Pelion  upon  Ossa,  to  reach heaven so. Expect  no trivial  truth  from  me, unless  I am  on  the witness-stand.  I will  come  as  near  to  lying  as you  can  drive  a coach-and-four.\"''*  Revealingly, in  letters  to  Blake,  he  insists  that  one  must  be  foolish  not  to  pursue  a  life  of simplicity and  examination.'''\n\nIf Thoreau  thus  leads us to  think  that  he  himself  exaggerates, what  are we to  make  of  the  ideal  he  erects?  Given  that  he  tries  to  serve  as an  exemplar,  it should be obvious enough that in works such as \"Resistance to Civil Government\"  and Walden, he  means to create  an  ideal  hero  out  of himself.  In light  of what  he says it  takes  to  create  an  ideal  hero  -  in other  words, what  is required  to  paint  a hero  who  is admirable  enough  to  be  an  ideal  to  which  we should  aspire  -  we  are  left  to  find it  quite  possible  that he purposefully overstates  the  extent  to which  we should  imitate  him, even when  he  maintains that we all must examine and  refuse  to pay taxes. So we can develop  substantial doubts about what precisely he encourages us to  do.\n\nHe sows  such doubt because he has'*\"  to offer us  only  very  vague direction.  The  ideal  hero  he  creates  out  of  himself  is  heroic  in  large  part  for finding  out  and  pursuing  his own  way, and  it is by following  his own  path  that he  ends  up  refusing  to  pay  taxes  and  engaging  in  examination.  It  is  not  only fine,  but  best  to  imitate  him  in  the  limited  sense  of  finding  out  and  pursuing one's own way, as he finds out  and pursues  his; but  to imitate him  in any  fuller sense  would  be  to  fail  to  imitate  him  well  enough  in  the  limited  sense  -  and thus  to  have  set  one's  sights  too  low.  My  own  path  may  not  lead  to  the  same places  that  Thoreau's  have  led  to;  and  imitation  is  so  numbing  that  \"One cannot  safely  imitate  the  actions,  as  such,  even  of  the  wise  and  good,\"  as  he writes  in  another  context.'*'  In  focusing  too  heavily  on  what  Thoreau  does  in following  his  own  path,  we  could  get  out  of  old  mental  ruts  only  to  fall  into new  ones.  The  way  he  guards  against  that  danger  is  to  open for us  the possibility that  he exaggerates.\n\nIt  is  important  to  note  that  in  taking  measures  to  keep  us  from  imitating him  too  much,  he  hardly  implodes  the  ideal  he  first  sets  up,  despite  the  doubt he can  generate. As a matter  of fact,  even  alone  his considerable  efforts  to  keep us from  lapsing into slavery to him are a testament  to  how resolutely he tries  to boost  us  toward  the  ideal, since  reaching  it,  to  repeat,  fundamentally  requires finding  one's  own  way. The  ideal  remains  standing  also insofar  as -  given  his claim that true accounts are extravagant relative to the norms of the community  to which we  belong - he  can  always leave  us wondering  whether his  accounts  are  not ultimately extravagant,  but  extravagant  merely  to  us;  for all  we  know,  it  could  ultimately  be  the  case  that  everyone  should,  indeed, refuse  to pay taxes and engage in solitary  examination.\n\nHowever, since Thoreau  nonetheless  can, and  does, present  no  more  than a  dim  ideal,  shedding  so  little  light  for  us,  there  is  a problem.  How  are  we  to find  our path  or  be compelled  enough  to look for  it in the  first  place.'  It  might seem  inevitable  that  we  will  stay  in  the  dark  hopelessly.  After  all,  we  tend  to think  that  navigators are able to head in the  best direction  only by first  figuring out precisely what their destination  is and  then  calculating their way to it.\n\n## V. The Importance  of  Critique\n\nHere  it  can  grow  plain  why  Thoreau's  critiques  are  necessary.  Notice  he says  that  it  is  \"[i]n  our most trivial walks  [that]  we  are  constantly,  though unconsciously, steering like pilots by certain well-known beacons and headlands, and if we go beyond our usual course we still carry in our  minds  the bearing of some neighboring cape. ...\"'*^ Our walks turn out  to be trivial when we  set  forward  having  already  decided  where  we  should  end  up,  because  a route  that  is  too  familiar  only  deepens  our  slumber  before  we  start  to  live deliberately,  and  a  course  which  is  too  easily  plotted  threatens  to  lull  us  to sleep  once  we  have  begun  to  do  so.  That  is  why  Thoreau eventually left Walden Pond, as he explains:\n\nI  left  the  woods  for  as good  a reason  as  I  went  there. ...  It  is  remarkable  how  easily  and  insensibly  we  fall into  a  particular  route,  and  make  a  beaten  track  for ourselves.  I  had  not  lived  there  a week  before  my  feet wore  a  path from my  door  to  the  pond-side;  and though  it  is  five  or  six  years  since  I  trod  it,  it  is  still quite  distinct.  It  is  true,  I  fear  that  others  may  have fallen into  it,  and  so  helped to  keep  it  open.  The surface  of  the  earth  is  soft  and  impressible  by  the  feet of  men; and  so with  the paths  which  the  mind  travels. How  worn  and  dusty,  then,  must  be  the  highways  of the world, how deep the ruts of tradition and conformity!'*^\n\nEven  after  centering  our  lives  on  examination,  all  of  us,  like  Thoreau,  stay predisposed  to  return  to  old  habits  or  develop  new  ones.  In  short, we can  find our  way  only  by getting  lost.  Critique  is an  indispensable  means  of  helping  us get and stay lost.\n\nThoreau has to critique the community  first to provoke us to free ourselves  from  it  while  it  still  enslaves  us. As entrenched  as we  are  in  our  ruts and  as  hazy  as  he  must  keep  the  ideal  he  presents,  it  may  not  have  sufficient power  by  itself  to  lure  us  out  of  our  confinement  in  the  first  place.  He  thus also  needs  a  way  to  help  wrench  us  free,  and  by  critiquing  the  culture  that holds  us  captive,  he  can  spur  us  to  walk  out of  slavery.  His  critiques  are\n\neffective insofar as they open our eyes to the extent to which we  are imprisoned. A central  function  of the  essay  \"Resistance  to  Civil  Government,\" for  example, is to  heighten  one's  sense of being a subject.  In  reading  the  essay, I  can  feel  imprisoned  especially  upon  the  realization  that  I  will  probably  have to  choose  between  remaining  a subject  and  being  literally  sent  to jail.  Further, it  is significant  that  in Walden, Thoreau  imagines  that  Walden  Pond  may  have been  \"called,  originally, Walled-in Pond.\"'**  In  works  such  as Walden, as  in \"Resistance  to Civil Government,\"  he  highlights  our  imprisonment  in order  to divest  us  of  our  ties  to  the  culture  which  enslaves  us. As  he  indicates  therein, \"our  lives must  be stripped\"  of those  ties in order  to  ultimately  grow  beautiflil and  full.'*5\n\nOnce  we  break free and take  up the task of  fmding our  own  way, Thoreau's  critiques, and  our  own,  still  are  crucial. The  ideal  he  lays out  grows no  less  hazy,  and  we  need  just  as  much  as  before to  be  alert  to  whatever threatens  our  ability  to  stay  awake, such  as returning  to  enslavement  or  falling back  into  mental  ruts.  Accordingly,  we  must  navigate  far  less  by  means  of a lodestar  than  by  figuring  out  which  places  to  leave  and  what  to  avoid  -  and critique  makes  it  possible  for  us  do  so.  Thoreau's  decision  to  leave  Concord, like his later choice  to  leave Walden  Pond, provides an example of why we may leave  a  place.  Part  of  his  essay  \"Life  Without  Principle\"  points  to  reasons  for which  we  may  avoid  certain  activities.  In  it,  Thoreau  bemoans  trivialities  and stresses  that  when  we  have  continually  focused  on  them,  we  have  \"desecrated ourselves\"  and  left  our  minds  \"profaned.\"  We  are  shaped  to  a large  extent  by what  occupies  our  attention,  and  when  immersed  in,  say,  newspaper  stories, gossip,  and  \"conventionalities,\"  one  easily  becomes  habituated  and  dozy,  and it  gets  more  difficult to  live  deliberately.'**  Thoreau's  critique  here  should attune  us  to  the  need  to  \"wash  and  purify\"  oneself,'*^  and  thereby  thwart drowsiness, by avoiding  trivialities. The  importance  of avoiding  them  can  help give us direction  as we look for  our  path.\n\nSince we must  find  our  way in  general  primarily  by determining  where  we had  better not be  and  what  it  is wiser  for  us not to  do,  instead  of setding  on  a precise  destination,  it  is, indeed,  the  case  that  Thoreau  emphasizes  backwardlooking  freedom,  as  opposed  to  forward-looking  freedom.  But  it  should  now be obvious  that in this Thoreauvian  picture, one seeks negative  freedom  simply for  the  sake  of  gaining  positive  freedom.  In  other  words, when  navigating  we look backward just because we have to do so to get properly lost: predetermining  exacdy what our destination  is would  keep us from  reaching  it. Our ultimate interest is in how  well one can come  to live  once firmly grounded,  and  our  focus  on  debasement,  helping  us  to  get  and  stay  lost, should  only serve as a heuristic  aid.\n\nThoreau vigilantly takes measures to ensure  that it becomes nothing  more. Given  our  tendency  to  fall  into  mental  ruts, we  could  even  get  stuck  looking backward, forgetting  that  the  purpose  of looking  backward  is to  move  forward\n\nin  the  best  direction.  It  is  savvy  of  Thoreau,  then,  to  level  this  criticism  in Walden's closing  paragraphs:  \"Some  would  find  fault  with  the  morning-red,  if they  ever  got  up  early  enough.\"'*'  Shortly  thereinafter, he  adds  that  \"The fault-finder will find faults even  in  paradise.\"'**  In indicting fault-finders, Thoreau  in  effect  critiques  the  very  enterprise  of  critiquing,  prompting  us  to break  free  also from  it  if it  should  take  us prisoner.  Moreover,  when  his  astute readers  detect  the  self-referential  incoherence  involved  in  finding  fault  with  all fault-finding  -  not  to  mention  the  irony  in Thoreau's finding  fault  with  it they  may  grow  even  more  suspicious  that  he  writes  \"extravagantly\"  and,  in turn,  be  less  prone  to  imitate  him  too  closely.  Even  in  critiquing  human culture,  Thoreau  is careful  to  sec  that  we  find  our  own  way.  Further,  he  not only  works  to  expose  our  enslavement,  but  also  underscores  the  potential  to escape  it.  In Walden., for  example,  his  critiques  are  interspersed  with  accounts of  how he has  found his way,  and  he  gives  us  strong  encouragement,  writing that  near  the  end  of  his  first  year  at  Walden,  he  saw  the  sun  light  up  the mist,''\"  and  adding,  for  example:  \"I  learned  this,  at  least,  by  my  experiment; that  if one  advances  confidently  in  the  direction  of  his dreams,  and  endeavors to  live  the  life  which  he  has  imagined,  he  will  meet  with  a success  unexpected in  common  hours.\"'\"  If we  get  and  stay  as  free  from  mental  ruts  as  critique should  help us be, he assures us, we can, indeed, reach  knowledge.\n\nDespite  how  lofty  Thoreau's  rhetoric  can  be  at  times,  what  he  calls  for  is more  feasible  than  it  might  at first seem.  He  would  simply  have  us  do  what  it takes  to  gain  what  he  calls  knowledge.  On his  terms,  we  are  in  the best position  to  gain  it  when  we  live  deliberately;  but  our  own  path  would  not necessarily  lead  to  an  isolated  pond  or  a  wholly  simplified  life,  and  it  might even  take  us  in  certain directions  Thoreau  would  avoid.  No  doubt, fully governing  ourselves might  also require  us to make what look like sacrifices,  but they would  be worthwhile  if he is  right  that gaining knowledge  matters  most.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn  the  end,  helping  us  find  our  own  way  is  one  of  Thoreau's  principal concerns.  Contrary  to  what  is  often assumed,  he  is  driven to  serve  other people.  It  is  in  large  part  to  benefit  them  that  he  works  to  cultivate  himself, holding  that  one  must  enrich  oneself  in  order  to  be  of genuine  use  to  others. That  is  evident  mainly  because  his  actions  cohere  with  his  account  of  what people need the most.  On his  account,  what  we most need is to gain knowledge  -  a sense  of  reality  that  renders  our  lives  profoundly meaningful - for  once  we  have  knowledge,  our  lives  can  start  to  become  beautiful  and full. We  lack  total control over  whether we  gain it, but when  we  live deliberately,  it is far  more  likely that  knowledge  will  come  to  us. The  reason  is that  we can  reach  knowledge  only  by losing  the world  in  the  sense  of  growing disoriented,  and  living  deliberately  sets us up  to  lose  the  world  in  that  respect. Living deliberately  requires serious reflection  on what  is best for  oneself, and  in\n\ncarrying  out  such  reflection,  we  come  face  to  face  with  the  possibility  of  living in  ways  that  are  foreign  to  us.  Earnesdy  considering  them  can  mean  growing bewildered  and  unsetded,  though  it  can  also  wake  us  up  enough  to  actually live.  We  resist  entertaining  foreign  possibilities,  because  we  are  entrenched  in certain  habits  of  thought,  many  of  which  are  inherited  from,  and  reinforced by,  the  culture  in  which  we  live.  We  must  break  free  from  our  community's influence  on  us,  losing  the  world  in  an  additional  respect,  in  order  to  get  lost in the sense  of growing  disoriented.\n\nAccordingly,  for  the  most  part,  Thoreau  performs his  service  to  other people  by  working  to  get  them  free  from  their  community's  influence.  Not wholly  unlike  Cicero  and  other  figures  in  antiquity,  he  presents  himself  as  an exemplar,  modeling  a life  of  thinking  for  and  governing  oneself  free  of slavery to  others.  The  ideal,  though,  is  fundamentally to find one's  own  way,  so Thoreau has  to keep  us  from trying  to imitate him  too  extensively.  The problem  would  lie  in  the  strong  temptation  to  unknowingly  identify  fmding our  own  way  with  following  the  particular  path  that  he  follows,  because  his path  may  not  be  our  own.  To  guard  against  the  danger,  Thoreau  leaves  us  to wonder  whether  he  exaggerates  or  is extravagant  in  maintaining,  say, that  we all  must  carry  out  philosophical  examinadon  and  refuse  to pay taxes. Since  the ideal  he  erects  thereby  grows  hazy,  it  alone  may  not  be  powerful  enough  to draw  us  out of  our habits  of  thought so  that  we  can  awaken  and live deliberately.  Further,  it would  not  work  for  us  to  try  to  find  our  way  by  using the  ideal  as a lodestar, since  our course would  be easily plotted,  and we have  to face  mystery  to  stay  adequately  awake.  Given  that  that  is the  case, we  need  a means of navigating as we try to find  our way.\n\nThoreau's  cridques,  then,  play  a  vital  role  in  his  service  to  other  people, much  as  other  rhetorical  devices  were  integral  to  ancient  spiritual  guidance. While,  for  example,  Lucredus'  violent  descriptions  stand  to  shock  his  readers into  seeing  themselves  more  clearly  and  Socrates'  confusing analogies  may leave  Euthyphro  more  compliant,  Thoreau's  critiques  should  help  us  reclaim and  preserve  our  autonomy.  On  the  one  hand,  they  should  first  spur  us  to escape  the  mental  habits  that  our  culture  reinforces.  On  the  other  hand,  they should  then  allow  us  to  stay  on  our  path  by  reminding  us  of which  places  to leave and  what  to avoid.  In  looking  backward  while  navigadng, we do,  indeed, focus  on  what  to  get  free from, but  our  ukimate  interest  is in  getdng  free for what  is  best.  Thoreau  serves  as our  guide  to  self-culdvadon,  prompdng  us  to find  our way toward  richer and  fuller  lives.'^^\n\nVanderbilt  University mason.marshall@comcast.net\n\n## NOTES\n\n- L Morton  White  and  Lucia  White, The  Intellectual Versus the  City, from Thomas Jefferson  to Frank  Lloyd  Wrijfht (Cambridge  [MA]:  Harvard  University Press,  1962), p. 30.\n2. Of course, despite how few of his writings Thoreau  published  during his  lifetime,  we  can  also  ask  why  he  bothers  to  publish  any  at  all,  since  in  writing  to other people, he maintains a connection with  them.\n3. It  makes sense to suppose  that even in crafting  critiques in his private journal, Thoreau  meant  to  benefit  other  people.  He  often  wrote  in  the  journal  as if he were  addressing  readers of a published  work, which  is not  surprising,  since  he  included in  published  writings  many segments  of text which  he  had  adapted  from  the journal.  It is worth  noting  also  that  given what  my discussion  below points  to, Thoreau  may level critiques for  his own  benefit,  as well as for  ours.\n4. See especially Brian Walker, \"Thoreau's Alternative Economics: Work,  Liberty,  and  Democratic  Cultivation,\" American Political  Science Review 92,  4 (1998):  845-56;  \"Thoreau  on  Democratic  Cultivation,\" Political  Theory 29,  2 (2001): 155-89; Pierre  Hadot,  \"'II y a de  nos jours  des professeurs  de philosophie,  mais pas de philosophes,'\"  in Exercices Spirituels  et  Philosophie Antique, nouvelle  ed., revue et augmentee  (Paris:  A.  Michel,  2002):  333-42.  Walker  writes,  for  example:  \"[Ancient pjhilosophers  could  teach a range  of exercises and  strategies  to help people  navigate  the everyday temptations and  obstacles of political  life while preserving  their moral  integrity and  political  reputation. Walden is  a  modern  revival  of  this  tradition.  ...  the  practices and  exercises  Thoreau  sets  out  in Walden are  functionally  identical  to  the  techniques found  in  ancient  philosophy.\"  Walker,  \"Thoreau's  Alternative  Economics,\"  p.  850.  I believe  that,  unlike  Hadot  -  whose  work  on  ancient  philosophy  he  draws  from  Walker  vastly  underplays  the  extent  to  which  both  Thoreau  and  ancient  philosophers seek  not  only to improve  the  logistics of life, but also to see it grow  more  meaningfiii  in an  ultimate  sense.

Whereas  Teichgraeber  and  Worley focus on straightforwardly  economic and political  implications of Thoreau's  critiques, I understand  them  here  as  a  rhetorical  device  integral  to  the  spiritual  guidance  that Thoreau  offers  individuals.\n12.

Some of what  I relate in the following  Milder  treats as symptomatic of the \"prickly  [striving for] self-justification\"  which  he claims \"colored  all [Thoreau's] relations to the world  except  his relation  to nature\"  (p. 93). For Milder, Thoreau was intent  upon  erecting  \"a  bulwark  against  social  and  self-accusation\"  (p.  109). Milder writes that  \"[I]f the  source of Thoreau's wit was aggression  and its aim self-apotheosis [as  Milder  maintains it was], its legitimacy  depended  on  his disguising  these  purposes and  administering  the rod  for  nominally  beneficent  ends\"  (p.  123). Milder,  though, scarcely  offers evidence  which  directly  supports  his  claim  that  Thoreau's professed mission to others was a disguised attempt to make himself look  better.\n21.

[For  Thoreau]  experiences are educative  only  if [we] actively clarify,  internalize, and  reflect  on  them  through  [our] own  language-making.\"  In  addition  to  the  passages  Bickman  cites  on  p.  xxx,  see,  for example, Thorczu,  Journal  3, p. 185  (9 February  1851)  (line adapted  for  \"Walking,\" p. 671),  where  Thoreau  apparently  understands  experiences  as  mental  exercise:  \"It  is remarkable  how  few  events  or  crises there  are  in  our minds' [emphasis  mine]  histories; how  little exercised we  have  been in  our  mind [emphasis  mine];  how  few experiences [emphasis  mine] we have  had.\"\n83. Thoreau, Walden,  p. 15.  In  the  passage  from  which  I  quote  here, Thoreau  refers  explicitly  to  philosophy.  See  Henry  D.  Thoreau, The Writings  of  Henry D.  Thoreau: Journal, Vol. 2,  1842-1848, Robert  Sattelmeyer  (ed.), (Princeton:  Princeton University  Press, 1984), p. 240  (after  18 April  1846).\n84. In  a  27  March 1848  letter  to  Harrison  Blake,  Thoreau makes  it especially  clear  that  the  point  of  simplifying  life  is to  dear  away  distractions.  Thoreau, Correspondence, p. 215.\n85. Thoreau, Walden,p. 52.\n86. See, for  example, Thoreau, Walden, p. 65: \"If  [other  people]  cannot understand  ['that  I can  live  on  board  nails'], they  cannot  understand  much  that  I  have\n\nto say.\" Sec also Richard Prud'Homme, \" Walden's Economy of Living,\" Raritan 20, 3 (2001), p. 108;  especially P.  Hadot, '\"II y  a  de nos  jours des  professeurs de philosophie. ...'\"\n\n87. Of  course,  the  form  of  philosophical  examination  which  Thoreau himself  takes  up  might  rarely  be  associated,  say,  with  Socrates,  who  characteristically promotes  rigorous  argument  and  counter-argument  within  a  dialogue.  (Nonetheless, see,  for  example,  Gary  Borjesson,  \"A  Sounding  of Walden's Philosophical  Depth,\" Philosophy and Literature 18, 2  (1994), p. 289; Tauber,  p.  3.)  In  fact,  it  is difficult  t'o tell  exactly what  constitutes Thoreau's  form  of examination:  his references  to  it -  for reasons  I  indicate  below  -  are  often  vaguely  metaphorical  and  short  on  details  in contrast  to  his meticulous  accounts  of  how  he  spent  his  money,  built  a house, and  so on.\n\n88. Thoreau, Walden, p. 97. Granted, Thoreau  writes in Walden, p. 56, that  he  is not  \"certain  it  is desirable  that  there  should  be\" a \"nation  of philosophers,\" but  in the rest of the passage, he goes on  to indicate  that it is best to  be a philosopher. Further, see,  for  example,  Thoreau, fournal 2, p. 145  (Fall-Winter 1845-1846), emphasis  mine,  where  he  writes  that  \"a//  men  should  live\"  the  life  of  the  genuine philosopher;  220  (Winter  1845-1846); Walden, pp.  94,  108-09.  In  conjunction  with this  line  in  Thoreau, fournal  3, p.  130  (after  31  October  1850):  \"You  might  say of a philosopher  that  he  is in  this world  as a spectator,\"  see  also Walden, p.  99,  emphasis mine:  \"With  a little  more  deliberation  in  the  choice  of  their  pursuits,  all  men  would perhaps  become essentially students, and  observers.  ...\" In  the  rest  of the  passage  there in Walden, it  is  dear  -  especially  given  the  context  of  the  passage  -  that  Thoreau indicates they should do so.\n\n89.

In speaking  the  truth, oiir  Friend \"expect[s]  nobleness  from us\"  (p,  267), presumably  in  the  spirit  in  which  Thoreau  asks  in  the  passage  in  \"Thomas  Cariyle\" quoted  above: \"Are we  not  all  great  men?\" See pp,  281-82;  \"T,  Pomponius  Atticus as an  Example\"  (30  June  1837), in Early Essays, p. III; Joumal 1, p. 107  (11  February 1840); \"Thomas  Cariyle,\" 265: \"[W]hat  is best is truest,  ,,,\"\n\n129, See  Thoreau,  \"Thomas  Cariyle,\"  p,  265:  \"To  a  small  man  every greater  is  an  exaggeration\"; Walden,  p. 324: \"Extra  valance! it  depends  on  how  you are  yarded.  The  migrating  buffalo,  which  seeks new pastures  in  another  latitude,  is  not extravagant  like  the  cow  which  kicks  over  the  pail,  leaps  the  cow-yard  fence,  and  runs after  her  calf, in milking  time,\"\n\n130. See  Thoreau, Walden., p.  324:  \"It  is  a  ridiculous demand  which England  and  America  make,  that  you  shall  speak  so  that  they  can  understand  you. Neither men nor toad-stools grow so.\"\n\n131. Thoreau entertains this possibility at times.  See,  for  example, Thoreau,/oÂ«mÂ«/i, p. 273 (26 February 1841), p. 469 (28 September  1843); Weekon the Concord, p. 365; Walden, pp.  141, 216-17. See also William C.

Thus, Thoreau writes, for example; \"My facts shall all be  falsehoods to the common sense.\" Thoreau,/oMrnÂ«/4, pp. 170-71 (9 November 1851).\n134. Thoreau,  \"Thomas Carlyle,\" p. 265.
