This  article  discusses  the  theory  of  perception  of  Peter  Auriol  (c.  1280-1322). Arguing  for  the  active  nature  of  the  senses  in  perception,  Auriol  applies  the  Scotistic doctrine  of  objective  being  to  the  theory  of  perception.  Nevertheless,  he  still  accepts some parts of the theory of species . The paper introduces Auriol's view on the mechanism of perception and his account of illusions. I argue for a direct realist reading of Auriol's theory  of  perception  and  propose  that  his  position  becomes  clearer  if  we  use  the distinction between  the firstand third-person perspectives which he seems  to presuppose.\n\nAccording to the medieval Franciscan philosopher and theologian Peter Auriol (c. 1280-1322),  our sensory powers play an active role in perception. This claim was typical 1 for  the  older  Augustinian  approach  common  among  the  Franciscan  thinkers  of  the thirteenth century.  Although Auriol shares some convictions and strategies with these 2 thinkers (e.g. the claim that perception is a vital operation, emphasis on the first-person perspective in theory of perception, etc.), his intellectual foundation is more Aristotelian\n\n1 See  e.g.  R.  L.  Friedman,  'Peter  Auriol,'  in The  Stanford  Encyclopedia  of  Philosophy  (Fall  2009 Edition) ,  ed. E. N. Zalta,  URL  =  &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2009/entries/auriol/&gt;  for  his  life  and works. Two works by Auriol are taken into account here: his commentary to the Sentences - esp. Scriptum of the first book (finished in 1316) and reportationes ( Rep. ) of his Parisian lectures on all four books (1316-18) -  and  his  magisterial Quodlibeta ( Quodl. ,  between  1319  and  1321).  I  use  following  editions:  Peter  Auriol, Scriptum  super  primum  Sententiarum ,  2  vols.,  ed.  E.  M.  Buytaert,  (St.  Bonaventure,  NY:  The  Franciscan Institute 1952-56) [abbr.

In the quotations from the Rep. II, I correct the text  according  to  two  manuscripts  -  Florence,  Biblioteca  nazionale  centrale,  MS  Conv.  Soppr.

Silva, 'Medieval Theories of Active Perception: An Overview,' in: Active Perception in the History of Philosophy , eds. J. F. Silva; M. Yrjönsuuri (Dordrecht, 2014), 117-46.\n\nor  Scotistic.  The  activity  of  the  senses  means  for  Auriol  simply  the  fact  that  sensory powers process the acquired information ( species or similitude of the object) and thereby they  put  their  object  into  'objective',  'intentional'  or-most  commonly  in  Auriol' works-'apparent  being'  ( esse  apparens ).  This  study  explores  to  the  exploration  and explanation of what Auriol says about such a perceptual process.\n\nMy interpretation of Auriol is founded on two key interpretative theses: (1) that his theory  of  perception  is  characterized  by  direct  realism;  and  (2)  that  his  theory  of perception can be usefully understood in terms of a distinction between the first- and the third-person perspectives. Regarding the first thesis: Auriol is undoubtedly a metaphysical realist; he proposes that objects exist outside our mind independently of our cognizing them.  However,  as  we  will  see  in  the  section  I,  some  of  his  claims  seem  to  imply  a representationalist account of perception (the view presupposing that what we immediately and primarily apprehend are some mediating entities, so-called representations ,  and not the things themselves, which are therefore apprehended these only  secondarily  and  indirectly).   At  other  times,  he  seems  to  favor 3 direct  realism (the view that our apprehension of the external things is direct and not mediated). I argue for a direct realist reading; hence, neither the species nor esse apparens are representations in my  interpretation.  Moreover,  I contend  that  Auriol  is  able  to  avoid  the  problems connected with naïve realism (the view that reifies appearances, holding that everything that  appears  also exists in  that  way).  Auriol  decisively  denies  that  'everything  that appears exists' as erroneous.  He is capable of explaining such phenomena as illusion or 4 perceptual relativity while neither reifying such appearances nor appealing to representations.\n\nThe paper's second key thesis is that in order to understand better Auriol's theory of perception it is sometimes useful to distinguish the first-person and the third-person perspectives. The distinction is well known from the contemporary philosophy of mind and  consciousness.   Third-person  features  of  our  cognitive  experience  are  objective  or 5 intersubjective  and  thus  analyzable  by  a  sort  of  metaphysics  (e.g.  what  is  the  relation between cognitive power and its object, what kind of entity is the cognitive act, etc.). First-person features are subjective and it is more accurate to use a sort of\n\n3 Traditionally, there were tendencies towards representationalist reading among the interpreters: cf. e.g. K. H. Tachau, Vision and Certitude in the Age of Ockham (Leiden, 1988), 89-104, 317.\n\n4 Scriptum , d. 3, q. 14, a. 1 (Buytaert II, 697, §31) and Scriptum , d. 9, p. 1, a. 1 (E-Scriptum, lin. 303-16).\n\n5 For  the  present  state  of  research,  see  R.  Van  Gulick,  'Consciousness,'  in The  Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2014 Edition) , ed. E. N. Zalta, URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/consciousness/&gt; and the literature referred there.\n\nphenomenology to describe them (e.g. conscious state of mind, attention, phenomenal properties of our cognitive experience, etc.).\n\nIn the first section, I examine the distinctive features of perception in Auriol's view and  gather  his  claims  about  the  topic  that  seem  to  be  incoherent.  In  the  next  two sections  I  focus  on  his  account  of  the  mechanism  of  perception  and  argue  that  this incoherence is  only  apparent  and  not  actual.  Section  II  examines  the  role  of species in Auriol's account: in his view, species /similitude is identical to the cognitive act. Section III is  devoted  to  Auriol's  peculiar  notion  of  'apparent  being'.  In  my  interpretation, esse apparens not  only  involves  a  special,  cognitive  relation  among  the  beholder,  the  thing, and  the  aspect  under  which  the  thing  appears  to  the  beholder  (from  the  third-person perspective), but also incorporates a conscious, phenomenal ingredient into our cognitive experience  (from  the  first-person  perspective).  When  the  mechanism  of  perception  is described, it remains to explain situations when the process is disrupted somehow and the sensory illusions may occur. Section IV is devoted to that issue. 6\n\nIt is worth noting that the issue of perception does not have a prominent place in Auriol's  works  (which  are,  strictly  speaking,  theological).  Nevertheless,  he  mentions perception quite often in the course of his works, employing the following strategy. His main interest is to study the nature of intellectual cognition; however, he believes that there  is a deep  similarity  between  acts  of  intellection  and perceptual acts. Since perception seems to him more easily understandable, he is convinced that we can learn something about intellection by comparing it with perception. Therefore, it is sometimes possible for the interpreter to employ the strategy backwards: we can learn what Auriol thinks about perception from reading his considerations on intellection. Nevertheless, as will  be  shown  immediately,  there  are  some  important  distinctions  between  perception and intellection that every readers of Auriol should keep in mind.\n\n## I.\n\nWhat  is  perception? One  strategy  Auriol  uses  in  answering  this  question  is  to compare  perception  with  two  other  kinds  of  cognitive  experience  -  namely,  with imagination and intellection. All these three kinds of cognition are similar to some extent:\n\n6 Although there were some studies into Auriol's theory of perception (cf. esp.  R. Wood, 'Adam Wodeham  on  Sensory  Illusions,' Traditio 38  (1982):  213-52;  Tachau, Vision  and  Certitude ,  89-100;  D.  G. Denery,  'The  Appearance  of  Reality:  Peter  Aureol  and  the  Experience  of  Perceptual  Error,' Franciscan Studies 55 (1998), 27-52), I assume the present paper is innovative in several aspects: it stresses the role of the species and perceptual acts, argues against representationalist reading of Auriol and brings new textual evidence (e.g. Scriptum ,  d.  35, Rep .  II,  d.  11,  and Quodl .,  q.  8)  to  the  evidence taken into account in these older interpretations.\n\nAuriol gathers them under the common notion of 'comprehension' ( comprehensio ).  In every case a cognitive faculty grasps an object by means of its act. But in what way do they  differ?  Interestingly,  Auriol  does  not  accept  the  common  Aristotelian  claim  that faculties differ by virtue of their objects  since 'whatever we perceive can fall under the 7 imagination, and whatever is imagined by us, our intellect can conceive'. The distinction among the faculties, therefore, is not established from the third-person perspective. They are not distinguished by the objects of their acts but by the way they grasp these objects, or,  in  Auriol's  own  words,  by  the  mode  in  that  the  objects  appear  to  the  acts  ( modus apparendi ). 8 Thus, we are aware of the distinction among the different kinds of cognition from the fact that every kind of cognition includes specific phenomenal properties, which is obvious from the first-person perspective.\n\nNow,  we  can  infer  some  distinctive  features  of  perception  by  focusing  on  the peculiar mode in which the object appears to senses , and comparing it with the mode of appearing (1) in the case of intellection and (2) in the case of imagination.\n\n- (1)  The  first  difference,  between  perception  and  intellection,  is  observable  in everyday experience: What we perceive is not under the command of our will, whereas we can think about whatever we want. One possible explanation of the observation is that objects of perception are outside us (and, therefore, beyond the reach of our will), whereas objects  of  our  intellect  (i.e.,  universals  in  the  first  place)  are  in  our  soul.  This explanation is mentioned already by Aristotle and discussed in Averroes's commentary; Auriol explicitly refers to both places. 9\n\nIn accordance  with  these  sources,  Auriol  assumes  that  the  diversity  in  our intellectual cognition is partially based on the fact that although intellectual cognitive acts are elicited by the conversion of our active intellect to the phantasms, this conversion is influenced by our will. We direct ourselves voluntarily to a more or less perfect impression made by an external thing and, as a result, our intellect creates a less or more universal\n\n7 Cf.  e.g.  Aristotle, De  an. II,  4,  415a16-23;  Auriol  ascribes  this  claim  to  Aristotle  and  Averroes  in Scriptum , d. 35, p. 4, a. 1 (E-Scriptum, lin. 291-4).\n\n8 Ibid. ,  p.  1,  a.  1  (E-Scriptum,  lin.  382-5):  ' Est  tamen  considerandum  quod  comprehensio  est  quid commune  ad  intelligere,  imaginari,  et  sentire.  Differunt  autem  ista  non  propter  alia  &lt;et  alia&gt;  apprehensa, quoniam quicquid sentitur, cadit sub imaginatione, et quicquid imaginamur, potest intelligi, etiam singulare, ut alias patebit; sed differunt in modo apparendi. ' Cf. also Scriptum , prooem., q. 2, a. 3 (Buytaert I, 204, §104).\n\n9 Cf. Aristotle, De an. II, 5, 417b and Averroes' commentary to that place in his De an. II,  comm. 60 (Averroes, Commentarium magnum in Aristotelis De anima libros , ed. F. S. Crawford (Cambridge, MA, 1953), 220-1). Auriol quotes both authors in the Scriptum , d. 36, p. 1, a. 2 (X 837aC-D).\n\nconcept according to the respective impression. 10 On  the  contrary,  the  richness  of  our perceptual experience is not an outcome of our will - the impression made by the thing in our  sight  is  natural,  not  voluntary.  The  degree  of  perfection  of  such  an  impression  is based  on  fully  natural  factors  (distance  between  the  thing  making  impressions  in  our senses and us, state of our senses etc.). 11\n\nApart from the role of the will, perception and intellection differ also in the way their  objects  appear  to  the  respective  faculty,  i.e.  in  their modus  apparendi . A  thing appears to the senses as a material individual, extended and situated in particular place and  time.  On  the  contrary, the  same  thing appears  to  the  intellect simpliciter , i.e. regardless  of  its  material  givenness  and  as  unsituated  spatially  and  temporally.  Auriol provides an illustration of this distinction using a notion of an imaginary straight line ( linea recta  imaginarie  ducta ).  In  sensory  cognition  we  can  extend  this  imaginary  straight  line from the eye to the object we see. The seen object is spatially localized by this line. 12 In contrast, in intellectual cognition we cannot extend anything like this straight line to the understood  object,  because  intellectual  cognition  abstracts  from  every  condition  of quantity - namely, from extension, contours, distance and closeness, etc. 13\n\nThe  possibility  of  extending  the  imaginary  line  is  based  on  the  materiality  and extension of both an object and cognitive power. Since senses are located in the material part  of  the  human  soul,  and  the  object  perceived  by  these  senses  is  also  material  and\n\n10 For the psychological mechanism whereby universal concepts are formed, see Auriol, Rep. II, d. 3, q.  2  and  e.g.  W.  Goris,  'Implicit  Knowledge  -  Being  as  First  Known  in  Peter  of  Oriol,' Recherches  de théologie et philosophie médiévales 69 (2002): 33-65, at 34-8.\n\n11 Rep. II,  d.  3,  q.  2,  a.  4  (X  68bA-D;  F  26va;  P  23va-b):  '[…] impressio, quam res facit in visu, est naturalis,  non  voluntaria,  ita  quod  non  subest  imperio  voluntatis,  quod  sit  tanta  vel  tanta  impressio […] diversitas illa impressionum in visu non subest potestati nostrae sicut in intellectu. Et ideo non est in potestate visus,  quod  perfecte  vel  imperfecte  recipiat  impressionem;  ymo  hoc  est  vel  ex  debilitate  potentiae,  vel  ex diversitate distantiae […]'\n\n12 Scriptum , d. 35, p. 1, a. 1 (E-Scriptum, lin. 385-8): ' Sensui namque et imaginationi apparent res sub condicionibus  quantitatis,  videlicet  ut  distantes  vel  propinquae  et  in  tali  situ  vel  tali;  unde  non  potest  quis videre quin necessario id quod apparet situet, et videat sub quadam linea recta per modum oppositi facialiter et distantis […]'\n\n13 Ibid. ,  lin.  388-401. The use of the notion of linea recta for describing perception may have been adopted  from  optical  tradition.  Both  ancient  and  medieval  optics  share  the  stress  on  a  geometrical description  of  vision.  Furthermore,  Auriol  explicitly  refers  to  the  authority  of  a  catoptrical  treatise concerning this issue: '[…] visa omnia directe videntur et sub quadam linea recta, imaginarie directa ab oculo in rem visam, ut patet libro De Speculis, propositione prima. ' -Scriptum , prooem., q. 2 (Buytaert I, 208, §119). The treatise may be the Latin translation of the Catoptrics by Euclid, although the source has not yet been confirmed.  Auriol  explicitly  refers  to  this  work  also  in Rep . II, d.  13  (in  manuscripts  we  read  ' hanc propositionem pono contra opinionem auctoris De speculis '  -  F  67ra;  P  60vb;  the  Renaissance edition has misleading ' Avempace ' - X 182aA).\n\nextended,  we  can  imagine  a  straight  line  between  them.  On  the  contrary,  intellect  is essentially an immaterial part of the human soul. If our intellect could deal with material objects, it would follow that it is a material cognitive power. (The rationale behind these considerations is the principle that the mode of operating follows the mode of being.) 14\n\n(2)  The  second  distinction  is  that  between  perception  and  imagination.  In  the tradition following Duns Scotus, the topic of sensory cognition was included in the inquiry into  intuitive  and  abstractive  cognition.  In  Scotus'  view,  perception  is  an  intuitive cognition  and  thus  terminates  at  an  object  that  actually  and  really  exists.  In  contrast, imagination is an abstractive cognition and thus grasps its object regardless of whether the object exists or not. 15\n\nAuriol  criticizes  the  way  Scotus  draws  the  distinction  between  perception  and imagination. 16 In  his  view,  the  object's  actual  existence  is not a  necessary condition for perception (or  intuitive  cognition  generally).  In  order  to  support  this  unusual  claim,  he refers to experiences of sensory illusions. 17 For example, when we look at a shining object and  then  turn  our  sight  to  a  dark  place  or  simply  close  our  eyes,  we  still  see  bright contours of the object - the afterimage. Thus, we can have an act of vision in our eyes even if  the  real  object  has  vanished  from  our  sensory  field.  According  to  Auriol,  in  the sensory illusion we still see something as present, and thus we have an intuitive cognition.\n\n14 Scriptum ,  d.  35,  p.  4,  a.  1  (E-Scriptum,  lin.  233-7):  '[…] demonstrativa  notitia  linearis [i.e.  such cognition  that  enables  the  line to be  led] est et quoddam  iudicium  quantitativum  quoad  modum apprehendendi,  non  quidem  quod  sint  ibi  lineae  tales  reales,  sed  quia  modus  iudicandi  est  talis.  Ergo  non competit  apprehensio  talis  potentiae  non-quantitativae  et  incorporeae,  alioquin  incorporeum  et  nonquantum  servaret  in  sua  operatione  modum  corporeum  et  quantum,  et  non  sequeretur  modus  operandi modum essendi. ' Auriol however proposes possibility of intellectual cognition of material singulars but not as material - cf. R. L. Friedman, 'Peter Auriol on Intellectual Cognition of Singulars,' Vivarium 38  (2000), 177-93.\n\n15 Ord. II, d. 3, p. 2, q. 2, ed. Vat. VII, 554, §323, cf. also Lectura II, d. 3, p. 2, q. 2, ed. Vat. XVIII, 323, §290. (For quotations from Scotus I use the Vatican edition - Scotus, Opera omnia , ed. Commissio Scotistica (Città del Vaticano, 1950-); abbr. 'ed. Vat.'.) Scotus' claims about the intuitive and abstractive cognition are not  so  straightforward  as  Auriol  assumed  -  see  Tachau, Vision  and  Certitude , 68-81  or  R.  Pasnau, 'Cognition,'  in The Cambridge  Companion to Duns  Scotus ,  ed.  T.  Williams  (Cambridge,  2003),  285-311,  at 296-300 and the literature listed there.\n\n16 For  Auriol's  criticism  of  what  he  thinks  Scotus  position  is  and  his  own  articulating  of  the intuitive/abstractive distinction see Scriptum , prooem., q. 2, a. 3 (Buytaert I, 196-207). The topic is quite well explored in the secondary literature - cf. P. Boehner, 'Notitia intuitiva of Non-Existents according to Peter Aureoli, OFM (1322),' Franciscan Studies 8 (1948): 388-416; Wood, 'Adam Wodeham on Sensory Illusions,' 213-7; Tachau, Vision and Certitude , 104-12; J. Biard, 'Intention and Presence: The Notion of Presentialitas in the Fourteenth Century,' in Consciousness. From Perception to Reflection in the History of Philosophy , eds. S. Heinämaa, V. Lähteenmäki, P. Remes (Dordrecht, 2007), 123-40.\n\n17 Scriptum , prooem., q. 2, a. 3 (Buytaert I, 198-9, §81-6). Cf. also section IV.\n\nHowever, it is not an actual, really existing object, but something that exists to a much lesser  extent  (Auriol  says,  as  will  be  expounded  below,  that  it  has  only  apparent  or intentional being). Sensory illusions show us that we can perceive the non-existing (in the strict  sense)  as  present.  Similarly,  we  can  have  an  abstractive  cognition  of  something actually existing when we imagine it as not present. Therefore, Auriol concludes, Scotus' distinction  between  perception  and  imagination  is  not  drawn  appropriately.  Auriol stresses the claim (mentioned above) that the distinction between kinds of cognition is not based on a difference on the part of object (e.g., on its actual existence), but on the way the object appear to us. He continues on to introduce the following four features that perception/intuition has and imagination/abstraction lacks. 18\n\nThe first feature of intuitive cognition is that it is a direct cognition (condition of rectitudo ) - we grasp an object directly, not discursively ( arguitive ) from a cause, effect, or  sign.  Second,  the  intuited  object  appears  to  us as a  present  one  (condition  of praesentialitas ) - however, the object need not actually be present for we can grasp even an absent object as though it were present ( modo praesentiali ). Third, the object appears to us as actual  (condition of actuatio obiecti ),  again even in the cases when it does not exist actually. The fourth and last condition simply repeats what is already included in the preceding ones - perception is able to re-make its object into an existing one (existing apparently,  at  least)  when  it  does  not  exist  really  and  actually  (condition  of positio existentiae ). 19\n\nHaving  considered  these  Auriol's  accounts  of  how  the  perception  differs  from both  intellection  and  imagination,  we  can  now  summarize  the  distinctive  features  of perception.  There  are  two  points  in  which  perception  differs  from  intellection:  (a) perception is independent of our will and (b) what is perceived by our senses appears to them as a material thing (as situated in some place and time). Further, it seems from his account of the differences between perception/intuition and imagination/abstraction that (c) the external object (or its real presence) is not a  necessary condition for perception (the only necessary condition is that the sensory faculty be in act) and, further, that (d) the sensory faculty and its act are capable of a production or  at  least  'shaping'  of  the object of perception.\n\n18 Ibid. , 204-205, §104-9.\n\n19 I do not interpret Auriol as claiming at this point that perception puts its object into esse apparens (see section II) whereas imagination does not (as Tachau, Vision and Certitude, 108 seems to assert) since such  an  ability  of  forming  its  objects  in  intentional  being  is  a  property  of every type  of  cognition  (both intuitive and abstractive). See Rep . II, d. 11, q. 3, a. 1, passim , where Auriol mentions esse phantasiatum , i.e. the mode of being of an imagined object.\n\nClaims  (a)  and  (b)  seem  to  be  compatible  with  some  sort  of  direct  perceptual realism:  There  are  real  objects  outside  us;  they  affect  our  sensory  faculties  making impressions  in  them,  which  we  cannot  control  by  means  of  our  will.  As  a  result,  the objects appear to us as they really are, i.e. extended and occupying a place. In contrast, in claims (c) and (d) Auriol looks rather like a proponent of phenomenalism or representationalism: We can perceive things that do not actually exist and our senses are 'formative' to some extent, as the cases of illusion suggest.\n\nThe  remainder  of  this  study  is  devoted  to  exploring  this  seeming  incoherence. Sections  II  and  III  are  focused  on  Auriol's  account  of  the  mechanism  of  perception, including his act/object analysis and introducing his peculiar notion of esse apparens . I will argue for the direct realist reading: Although in every perception we perceive the thing under  a  certain aspect ,  we  perceive  it  directly  and  not  by  means  of  a  mediator.  Even illusions can be described in that way - as we will see in section IV, they are products of defective  perceptual  process.  In  them  we  either  grasp  the  real  object  that  appears differently from what it is, or simply have a cognitive experience which can be described as having a quasi-object.\n\n## II.\n\nSpecies and Cognitive Acts. As we have seen, Auriol is quite willing to use the firstperson perspective in constructing his theory of perception. The point of departure in his analysis of the nature of cognition is not a reception of a form in an observer's cognitive faculty (i.e. a sort of 'physical'  event,  as many  of  his  more  Aristotelian-minded contemporaries  suppose),  but  the conscious aspect  of  our  cognitive  experience:  to cognize is for an observer 'nothing other than to have something present by means of a mode of appearing '. 20 However, although the conscious aspect is an important feature of our cognitive experience, Auriol does take into account also the mechanism of cognition, at  least  to  some  extent.  Vision  as  well  as  understanding  has  both  passive  and  active aspects: (1) Cognition is passive insofar as our cognitive faculty undergoes a change and receives a real impression ( pati realiter ), and (2) it is active insofar as the faculty responds to the stimuli by an intentional action ( agere intentionaliter ), i.e., by putting the thing into\n\n20 Scriptum ,  d.  35,  p.  1,  a.  1  (E-Scriptum,  lin.  332-3):  '[…] non  est  plus  de  formali  ratione  ipsius intelligere,  aut  cognoscere  in  universali,  nisi  habere  aliquid  praesens  per  modum  apparentis […]'  Cf.  R.  L. Friedman,  'Act,  Species,  and  Appearance.  Peter  Auriol  on  Intellectual  Cognition  and  Consciousness,'  in Intentionality, Cognition, and Mental Representation in Medieval Philosophy ,  ed. G. Klima (New York, 2015), 141-65, at 141-50.\n\napparent being. 21 This and the following sections are devoted to the very mechanism of a veridical  perception,  i.e.  perception  under  normal  circumstances.  I  want  to  defend  the thesis that Auriol's theory of perception is an original application of the Scotistic notion of the objective being ( esse obiectivum )  to  the domain of sensation, combined with a few features inherited from the Aristotelian explanation of perception (though substantially reinterpreted).\n\nAs  it  is  suggested  by  his  insistence  on  the  passive  and  the  active  aspects  of cognition, there is a duality in  Auriol's  account  of  the  topic.  He  proposes  an  act/object analysis of cognition experience: 22 Every instance of cognition comprises (1) a cognitive act  by  means  of  which  the  cognitive  faculty-being  in-formed  by  a  similitude  or  a species -grasps an object and (2) the intentional object, or, in Auriol's words, the thing insofar as it is grasped by an act and which has apparent being).\n\nNow, what is a cognitive act? Or in Auriol's words, what is that by virtue of which ( id quo ) something appears to us and is cognized by us? Auriol proposes what we can call a 'minimal' definition of a cognitive act: it is an absolute entity ( absolutum ) that has real or  subjective  ( subiectivum ) being  in  our  soul.  It  is  not  so  important  for  explaining cognition what this entity is in physical terms (whether it is a species , or something in the brain, or a so-called glacial humor in the eyes), as long as it is a real vehicle which makes the process of cognition possible and the thing cognized appearing. 23 Hence, it is obvious that Auriol does not focus on the exact physical or physiological realization of perception, unlike,  e.g.,  his  contemporaries  who  wrote  treatises  on  optics  or  commented  on  the parva naturalia . Yet he tries to relate his account to the ones common in his time and uses the metaphysical terminology of sensible and intelligible species and acts ( actus ).\n\nInfluenced by Aristotelians' claim that perception is a reception of a form without matter, 24 some  thinkers  at  the  time  expounded  such  an  explanation  of  perception:  an\n\n21 Scriptum ,  d.  27,  p.  2,  a.  2  (E-Scriptum,  lin.  538-40):  '[…] tam videre quam intelligere est pati et agere:  pati  quidem  realiter,  sed  agere  intentionaliter  et  secundum  iudicium,  in  quantum  visio  et  intellectio, ultra hoc quod sunt reale aliquid, ponunt res in esse intentionali et iudicato […]'\n\n22 Arguments for an act/object approach to cognition are in his Scriptum , d. 27, p. 2, a. 2; see also D. Perler, 'What am I thinking about? John Duns Scotus and Peter Aureol on Intentional Objects,' Vivarium 32 (1994), 72-89, at 81-6. Auriol uses such an approach even in the cases of illusion - see the section IV.\n\n23 Scriptum ,  d.  35,  p.  1,  a.  1  (E-Scriptum,  lin.  411-4):  '[…] quicquid  sit  illud  quo  habeatur  aliquid praesens  per  modum praedictum, sive illud  esset  pictura  in  pariete,  sive  cerebrum  in  capite,  sive  spiritus  in cerebro, sive glacialis humor in oculo, sive species, sive quodcumque aliud, dum tamen res per illud haberentur praesentes et apparentes, non dubium quod dicerentur comprehensiones et notitiae quaedam. '\n\n24 Cf.  Aristotle, De  an. II,  12,  424a17-24.  On  medieval  Aristotelian  theory  of  perception  see  S. Knuuttila,  'Aristotle's  Theory  of  Perception  and  Medieval  Aristotelianism,'  in Theories  of  Perception  in Medieval and Early Modern Philosophy ., eds. S. Knuuttila, P. Kärkkäinen (Dordrecht, 2008), 1-22.\n\nexternal object affects our cognitive faculties by means of so-called species ,  i.e.  peculiar entities which are similar to this object. Such affection brings the faculty to the actuality ( actus )  and  by  means  of  this  state,  the  faculty  grasps  the  object. Species or  form  is  a vehicle which precedes the cognitive act. 25 In  contrast,  other  authors  of  this  time  deny that  the  very  notion  of species is necessary  or  even  reasonable  for  explanation  of cognition (Olivi in the case of sensory cognition, Henry of Ghent for intellectual cognition and Ockham for both of them). 26 In their view, the cognitive acts themselves suffice for such an explanation.\n\nWhat is Auriol's stance? There is a disagreement among the scholars on this issue. Whereas  some  of  them  deny  that  Auriol's  account  of  cognition  presupposes  the postulation  of species , 27 the  others  claim  that  it  has  its  place  in  Auriol's  account. 28 Definitely,  Auriol does use  the  term species quite  frequently. 29 But  in  the  context  of cognition, it does not designate an entity that precedes the act but is used co-extensively with the term 'act'.\n\nAuriol actually identifies the species and the act. 30 At the first sight, such a position seems  highly  implausible.  An  obvious  objection  comes  to  mind:  If  the species were identical  with  the  act,  it  would  follow  that  even  a  medium  transmitting  the species is cognitive -  due  to  having  the species in  itself  it  would  have  cognitive  acts. 31 As  Scotus remarks,  the  problem  cannot  be  resolved  by  saying  that species in  the  medium  and\n\n25 For  example  Aquinas  -  see  e.g.  R.  Pasnau, Theories  of  Cognition  in  the  Later  Middle  Ages (Cambridge, 1997), 11-8.\n\n26 See e.g. Tachau, Vision and Certitude, 28-54, 130-5.\n\n27 L.  Spruit, Species Intelligibilis: From Perception to Knowledge ,  2  vols. (Leiden, 1994), 1:286-90, or Friedman, 'Act, Species, and Appearance,' 157-64 (both on intelligible species ).\n\n28 Tachau, Vision and Certitude, 98-100 and probably Perler, 'What am I thinking about?,' 81-6.\n\n29 Besides ' species ', Auriol uses other terms for designation of the same entity: esp. 'impression' ( impression )  suggesting  that species is  an  effect  the  external  object  makes  in  the  cognitive  powers,  or (perhaps most frequently) 'similitude' ( similitude ) stressing the fact that species is  similar to the external object.\n\n30 Auriol repeats this unconventional claim from the earliest to the most mature of his works - cf. Scriptum , d. 35, p. 1, a. 1 (E-Scriptum, lin. 569-648); Rep. II, d. 11, q. 3, a. 1 (X 127a-132a; F 47va-49ra; P 42rb43vb); Quodl. q. 8, a. 3 (X 85a-86a). His source in this claim can be nobody else than Peter Olivi who also identified species with  the  act  of  cognitive  power  -  cf.  Olivi, Sent. II,  q.  58  (Peter  Olivi, Quaestiones  in secundum librum Sententiarum , 3 vols., ed. B. Jansen (Quaracchi, 1922-26), III, 470-3). There is, however, no explicit sign that Auriol could be influenced by the very text by Olivi. Rather, it is probable that he knew that position from Scotus' refutation of it - cf. Scotus, Ord. I, d. 3, p. 3, q. 2 (ed. Vat. III, 282-284, §471-3). Auriol tries to defend the position exactly against Scotus' arguments in Rep. II,  d.  11,  q.  3,  a.  1  (X  131bF-132aE;  F 49ra; P 43vb).\n\n31 Actually, this is one of the objections against this thesis made by Scotus - cf. his Ord. I, d. 3, p. 3, q. 2 (ed. Vat. III, 283, §471-2).\n\nspecies /act  in  the  eye  differ  according  to  the  various  nature  of  their  recipients  ( propter diversa recipientia ). Just as whiteness is the same in a horse and in a stone, species in the medium and species in the eye are of the same nature ( eiusdem naturae ) and hence, if the species and the act were an identical entity, the medium would see . 32\n\nAuriol has to deal with that objection - and his strategy is to stress the very point which Scotus refutes. Although the species and the cognitive act are the same entity, they differ in one aspect: where exactly they are received. When the species is in the medium (or in a non-apprehensive power), it is simply a species as a causal effect of an object and similitude  of  that  object.  But,  Auriol  stresses,  when  the species is  in  the  apprehensive power, in  a  cognitive  faculty  of  a  living  creature,  the  very  same  entity  is  the  cognitive act. 33 The difference lies in the fact that similitudes that are in a cognitive faculty (and only those similitudes) are capable of setting the cognitive process going (see below). 34\n\nSince species and act are in fact the same entity, distinction between them cannot be  the real distinction  but  a  minor  one  -  we  can  call  it  'connotative  distinction'. 35 Although the terms ' species ' and 'act' signify the same simple thing, more is connoted by 'act' than by ' species '. 36 Cognitive acts-apart from signifying the simple qualityconnote also what Auriol calls 'objective appearance of the thing' ( apparentia obiectiva rei ), i.e. the thing presented and grasped by those acts insofar as it appears to them. 37 To illustrate such a distinction, Auriol introduces an example with a column (in a colonnade, we can imagine): we can call the very same column 'left' or 'right'. When we call it 'left\n\n32 Ibid. , §472.\n\n33 Quodl. ,  q. 8, a. 3 (X 85bC-D): ' Et ideo dicendum, quod licet species, et actus cognitivus idem sint secundum suum absolutum, tamen differunt ratione in hoc, quod ubicunque in potentia non apprehesiva […] , similitudo illa ponatur, habet rationem tantummodo speciei, et non actus, et ideo species […] in medio non est comprehensio; in potentia vero cognitiva est comprehensio, non additur autem aliud, dum est comprehensio nisi sola praesentialitas, et apparentia obiectivi […] ' .\n\n34 The presupposition behind this claim is that perception is a vital operation and only living beings endowed by a cognitive faculty are capable of cognition. A criterion for cognitive experience is therefore life .  See Scriptum ,  d. 35, p. 1, a. 1 (E-Scriptum, lin. 345-50) and Friedman, 'Act, Species, and Appearance,' 146-8.\n\n35 On the connotative distinction in Auriol's theology, see R. L. Friedman, Intellectual Traditions at the Medieval University. The Use of Philosophical Psychology in Trinitarian Theology among the Franciscans and Dominicans,  1250-1350 ,  2  vols.  (Leiden,  2013),  1:  576-577.  For  Auriol's  refutation  of  the  Scotistic  formal distinction,  see  T.  B.  Noone,  'Ascoli,  Wylton,  and  Alnwick  on  Scotus's  Formal  Distinction:  Taxonomy, Refinement,  and  Interaction,'  in Philosophical  Debates  at  Paris  in  the  Early  Fourteenth  Century ,  eds.  S.  F. Brown, T. Dewender, T. Kobusch (Leiden, 2009), 127-49, at 148-9.\n\n36 Rep. II, d. 11, q. 3, a. 1 (X 132aD; F 49ra; P 43vb): '[…] ad visionem enim plura concurrunt, quam ad rationem speciei, licet 'visio' nullam aliam qualitatem abstractam (F, P) dicat aliam a specie. '\n\n37 Ibid. :  '[…] sufficit, quod 'visio' secundum rationem visionis connotet apparentiam obiectivam rei, quam non connotat (F, P) 'species' secundum rationem speciei […]'\n\ncolumn', we signify by that expression the column and connote another column right of the first one. Contrarily, by calling it 'right column', we connote the column standing left of  the  first  one.  There  is  no  real  change  in  that  column,  of  course. 38 Similarly,  when  a certain entity is in the medium, we can call it ' species ' and when the very same entity is in the sight, we can call it 'vision' or 'act of vision', since we connote also the fact that there is a thing in apparent being which is presented by that act.\n\nWhy does a similitude sometimes represent the thing and sometimes not? After all, Auriol explicitly says that species and act are 'of the same nature' - does it not follow that a similitude should always represent the thing no matter whether it is in the faculty, or  in  the  medium?  But  Auriol  denies  that  it  does.  Certainly,  the  similitude  is capable of 'representation', i.e. of 'making the thing present'. However, it does not have to exhibit this property everywhere and at any time. It does not have this property precisely from itself  but  only  when  it  is  in  a  suitable  cognitive  faculty. 39 Only  in  that  case  the  thing  is represented and the similitude can be called 'cognitive act' properly. 40 The reason is that the faculty has an important role in eliciting the act, as we will see in the next section.\n\nIf the species is a representation and its proper job is to represent ( representare ), however, this raises the question of whether Auriol is a representationalist. I argue that representationalism  would  follow  if  the species was  the  primary  object  of  the  act.  But Auriol resolutely denies that by introducing several arguments. 41 For example, he adduces a metaphysical argument: Since the sight is a material faculty, it is not capable of having reflexive  act;  so  its  acts  cannot  apprehend  anything  that  is in the  faculty.  Another argument is phenomenological: If the first object of our vision were the species in the eye, we would therefore attend to two different objects in every perception (one in our eyes and the second outside us); but we experience nothing of the sort.\n\nConsequently, for Auriol, the species in our sight cannot be the first object seen by us ( primum visum ) and a mediator that we grasp in order to see the external thing. Auriol is more thorough in refuting the possibility of species being the first object of sight than many of his contemporaries were. In fact, some of them assumed that there is a certain\n\n38 Quodl. , q. 8, a. 3 (X 85bF): ' Dato quod species non differant ab actu realiter sed sola ratione scilicet solo actuali representare praesentiam subiecti. Videmus enim, quod sinistrum in columna non differt re, cum sit relatio rationis, et tamen amittit rationem dextri, sola immutatione facta alibi. '\n\n39 Ibid. , 85bD:  ' Quamvis  enim  similitudo  semper  sit  apta  nata  praesentare  obiectum  et  facere apparere, non tamen praecise hoc habet a se, nec in omni subiecto, et propter hoc […] in medio, quamvis sit species, non tamen obiecta praesentialiter repraesentat […]'\n\n40 Ibid. ,  a.  2  (X  83bF-84aA):  '[…] repraesentare sit rem praesentem facere; patet quod si ponatur similitudo  in  potentia,  cui  potest  fieri  repraesentatio,  qualis  est  cognitiva,  exhibebit  actu  rem  praesentem; igitur omnis similitudo existens in potentia cognitiva ultimate disposita est actus cognitivus […]'\n\n41 For these arguments, see Scriptum , d. 35, p. 2, a. 4 (X 783aE-783bD).\n\nsituation  when  the species can  become  the object of  an  act  -  namely  a  defective perceptual experience like illusions or seeing afterimages. For example, Scotus supposes that when we see afterimages, we have a visual act by means of which we grasp a species impressed in our eyes (presumably with big force due to a sharp light). Hence, species can be the object of a visual cognitive act in that special case. 42\n\nSuch a position is, of course, made possible by the thesis that species is something that precedes the act and is really distinct from it. Scotus assumes-in accordance with the optical tradition 43 -that the seat of vision is the optic chiasm and the acts of vision are  thus  situated  there.  Since species is  in  the  eye,  there  is  a  certain  distance  between species and  the  act  and  hence species can  be  seen.  However, Auriol's insistence on the thesis  that species is  really  identical  with  the  cognitive  act  disbars  him  from  such  a position - there is no possibility for species to become an object of the act according to his theory. 44\n\nTo sum up (and not mentioning Auriol's emphasis on the immediacy as a feature of intuitive  cognition/perception),  it  is  clear  Auriol  denies  the  claim  we  perceive  external objects secondarily through perceiving their species first, which is essential for representationalist  account  of  perception.  I  contend  that  when  Auriol  calls  species 'representation' and its proper job 'representing' ( representare ), we should understand him  quite  literally: species is  a  vehicle  which  permits  the  thing  to  be presented to  a cognitive power - and nothing more.\n\n## III.\n\nAppearances:  the  Objective  Being  in  Perception. Let  us  now  turn  to  the  second, active aspect of perception, which completes the process of perception and which Auriol describes  metaphorically:  Acts  put  the  things  into  'apparent  being'  ( esse  apparens ). What is esse apparens ? I argue that it involves a special, cognitive relation (from the thirdperson perspective) and that it introduces a conscious, phenomenal ingredient into our cognitive  experience  (from  the  first-person  perspective).  The  end  of  the  section  is devoted to the question whether this amounts to a mental representation and-againwhether it leads Auriol to perceptual representationalism. I answer both questions in the negative.\n\n42 Scotus, Ord. I, d. 3, p. 1, q. 4 (ed. Vat. III, 145, §239).\n\n43 Cf. e.g. Roger Bacon, Perspectiva I,  d. 5, c. 2 (Roger Bacon, 'Perspectiva,' ed. D. C. Lindberg, in Roger Bacon and the Origins of Perspectiva in the Middle Ages (Oxford, 1996), 1-338, at 62-4).\n\n44 As  a  consequence,  Auriol  is  forced  to  search  for  other  ways  to  explain  sensory  illusions  -  see section IV.\n\nHow is the cognitive mechanism completed? The passive reception of a species in the  cognitive  power  is  not  cognition  yet.  In  that  case,  even  a  medium  itself  would  be capable of perception - after all, it receives forms. 45 In Auriol's view, the cognition is 'to have  something  present  by  means  of  a  mode  of  appearing' 46 and  the species itself  is incapable of fulfilling this definition (recall the section II: it does not have the capability of making things present from itself but only when it is in  the  cognitive  faculty).  For  this reason, Auriol does not assume that species or similitude is a sufficient condition for vision (or cognition generally) and that it is to be identified with the cognitive act wherever it is. It is important for the species to be received and processed in the suitable cognitive power of a living being. Only in this situation the similitude becomes a full-fledged cognitive act and the external object begins to appear and is perceived. 47 Hence, there are two partial causes in the elicitation of the cognitive act: firstly, the similitude of the real thing (or its species ,  in  the  older  terminology) and secondly, the cognitive faculty itself in which the similitude  resides.  These  things  together,  i.e.  the  faculty  in-formed  by  the  similitude, constitute a unity ( coniunctum ) that elicits the cognitive act and makes the thing appear, or, in Auriol's words, 'gives birth to the objective [component of] cognition or puts the thing into the apparent being'. 48\n\nBoth constituents of the cognitive act have their own contributions: the faculty creates  the  appearance  (it  gives  the  intentional  being  to  the  cognized  object  and determines the mode of appearing) and the similitude individuates the appearing thing (providing that precisely this and not the other thing appears). 49 When we perceive an apple in front of us, the similitude of the apple in our power of sight determines that we see precisely this apple and the power of sight itself determines that the apple appears to\n\n45 This is a problem of the traditional receptionist accounts of perception, acute e.g. in Aquinas  see Pasnau, Theories of Cognition , ch. 1.\n\n46 See note 20.\n\n47 Scriptum , d. 35, p. 1 , a. 1 (E-Scriptum, lin. 684-6): '[…] sola rei similitudo non sufficit ad ponendum res in esse apparenti, nec etiam ad ponendum in esse apparenti huic, alioquin species in aere poneret colorem in esse apparenti et intentionali, […] quod falsum est. '\n\n48 Scriptum , d. 9, p. 1, a. 1 (E-Scriptum, lin. 394-7): '[…] illud absolutum a quo oritur notitia obiectiva [ est   coniunctum  quoddam  ex  potentia  intellectiva  et  ex  similitudine  ipsa.  Nec  enim  potentia  per  se  ipsam ] ponit  res  in  esse  formato,  nec  similitudo,  aut  qualitas  quaecumque,  sed  utrumque  simul  parit  notitiam obiectivam sive ponit res in esse apparenti […]' Auriol here examines more extensively the nature of the vehicle by means of which the thing appears - see ibid. ,  lin.  364-425 and the interpretation in Friedman, 'Act, Species, and Appearance,' 150-4.\n\n49 Quodl. q.  8,  a.  3  (X  85bD-E): ' Habet igitur species in potentia cognitiva, ut faciat apparere, quia utrumque potentia  scilicet  et  species,  constituunt  unum,  ad  quod  sequitur  obiecti[va]  apparentia,  ita  quod quia  esse  apparens  est  esse  vitale,  quod  sit  haec  apparitio,  est  ex  potentia;  quod  vero  sit  talis  res  sub  ista apparitione, est ex specie ipsa. '\n\nus under certain aspect (or under the 'mode of appearing', in Auriol's words) - i.e. as an individual red thing occupying a certain place.\n\nBesides  the  language  of  'producing'  something  in  apparent  being, 50 Auriol deploys other terminology for expressing the activity of our cognitive powers. Following an Averroistic claim, Auriol proposes that senses are both passive and active in the sense that they receive something and then 'judge' it. 51 Although the ascription of the ability of judgment ( iudicare )  to  the  senses  may  seem  strange  to  us,  we  should  not  understand such 'judgments' as linguistic complexes of subjects and predicates. 52 Rather, I contend, this  ability  should  be  understood  as  another  expression  of  the  activity  of  senses. 'Judging' is an active response on the reception of species or similitudes; it is an active processing  of  the  information  included  in  the species . As  Auriol  remarks,  to  judge something means, for the senses, nothing other than to put it in the apparent being. 53\n\nTo summarize: Auriol's account of perception is based on the conviction that the sensory faculty is active. It produces the apparent being of the object perceived and does so according to the information encoded in the similitude. The similitude is what presents the object to the faculty; it determines that this concrete object appears to the faculty etc., and is itself actively processed (or 'judged') by the sense. Thus, the perception is a result of active processing of the information in a similitude our sensory faculties receive.\n\nYet,  what  is  'apparent  being'  precisely?  I  argue  that esse  apparens should  be understood as an instance of the broader notion of 'objective being' ( esse obiectivum ). 54 The doctrine of objective being was developed chiefly by Duns Scotus in the theological context  of  the  issue  of  divine  ideas  and  then  spread  among  scholars  of  the  next generation, especially Scotistic or Franciscan thinkers such as Jacob of Ascoli, William of Alnwick,  Henry  of  Harclay,  early  Ockham  etc.  One  of  the  most  prominent  contexts  in which  this  doctrine  was  used  was  the  topic  of  universals  and  relations  and  their\n\n50 This  terminology  is  undoubtedly  influenced  by  Auriol's  theology:  there  is  a  deep  connection between psychology and Trinitarian theology in his thinking expressed by 'psychological  model'  of  the Trinity. For that issue, see Friedman, Intellectual Traditions , 1: 28-42, 563-93.\n\n51 See quotation in the note 21 and Averroes, De an. II, comm. 149, ed.

The  difference  between  (a)  and  (b)  is  dependence  on  a  cognitive  act: Whereas a thing has (a) real being independently of being grasped, the same thing has (b) objective being insofar as it is grasped by the act. Thus, the distinction is not based on the property of being (intra)mental: e.g., although cognitive acts are surely mental or psychic entities, they nevertheless have (a) real being (they are real accidents of the soul).\n\nThere are three possible combinations of these modes of being: a thing can have (i) only real being, (ii) real and objective being at the same time, (iii) only objective being. Only the latter two possibilities are interesting with respect to cognitive theory. Case (ii) concerns  normal  veridical  cognition  -  the  act  of  perception  or  intellection  grasps  an existing thing 'as it really is'. In that case, the thing exists in both waysrealiter in the world, obiective as  the  object  of  a  cognitive  act-but it  is  one  and  the  same thing. 57 In case (iii), a cognitive act grasps an entity that actually does not exist. These entities can be  universals  (for  conceptualist  thinkers),  relations,  some  imagined  things,  or  illusory objects. 58 This does not mean that such entities are pure fictions, something we fabricate arbitrarily: they have at least some grounding in reality. For example, to have a universal\n\n55 For  the  doctrine  of  objective  being,  see  e.g.  M.

Friedman, 'Peter Auriol on Intentions and Essential Predication'; for relations see M. Henninger, 'Peter Aureoli and William of Ockham on Relations,' Franciscan Studies 45 (1985): 231-43; for illusory objects see section IV.\n\nconcept is to grasp an individual (this rose) under a certain aspect (in its universality). The doctrine of objective being enables us to use an act/object analysis in type (iii) cases, and to describe these entities using vocabulary we use to describe ordinary real things.\n\nBut how can we put in intentional being and consequently cognize (or-in Auriol's case-even see )  a  thing  that  actually  does  not  exist?  How  can  our  cognitive  powers experience non-existing entities? One possible solution is to take cognitive relations as a special  kind  of  referential  relations  that  includes  also  words,  signs  and  images.  In scholastic  philosophy  these  relations  were  subsumed  under  a  common  category  of 'denomination' ( denominatio ).  So-called extrinsic denomination is naming a thing from something  that  is  not  inherent  itself,  but  from  a  relation  which  the  thing  has  toward something else. For example, we can use the word 'portrayed' to designate Caesar due to  the  portrait  depicting  him.  Similarly,  in  the  view  of  some  thinkers-e.g.,  Alnwick, Radulphus Brito or mature Ockham-'being cognized' ( esse cognitum ) simply denominate a thing insofar as it is being grasped by a cognitive act. The advantage of this view lies in his simplicity: there is no need to postulate more entities than the cognitive act and the real thing grasped by the act. When the real thing is lacking it does not mean that we cannot have a cognitive act about it - just as we have words that do not refer to anything  or  paintings  that  do  not  depict  actually  existing  people. 59 However,  Auriol explicitly  denies  that  'being  cognized'  or  '(being)  appearing'  is  only  an  (extrinsic) denomination which the thing receives from the fact that an act external to itself grasps it. 60 In  Auriol's  view,  cognitive  relations  are  peculiar  kinds  of  relations  because  they include something we can call a 'phenomenal ingredient'. The cognized thing appears to the observer; it is experienced as present and introduced to him; it seizes his attention. 61\n\nFrom  these  remarks  we  can  conclude  that  when  a  thing  is  posited  in  apparent being  and  appears  to  the  observer,  'seen',  'cognized'  or  'appearing'  are  not  only\n\n59 On Alnwick, see Tweedale, 'Representation in Scholastic Epistemology,' 75-8; on Ockham, see F. Amerini, 'Realism and Intentionality: Hervaeus Natalis, Peter Aureoli, and William Ockham in Discussion,' in Philosophical Debates at Paris in the Early Fourteenth Century , eds. S. F. Brown, T. Dewender, T. Kobusch (Leiden, 2009), 239-60, at 240-2.\n\n60 Auriol's denial is a part of his refutation of Radulphus Brito's theory of intentions in Scriptum , d. 23,  a.  2  (Peter  Auriol,  'Scriptum  super I  Sent.,  dist.  23,'  in  Giraldus  Odonis, Opera philosophica, vol. 2: De intentionibus ,  ed.  L.  M.  De  Rijk (Leiden,  2005),  695-747,  at  713-715).  Cf.  also Scriptum ,  d.  3,  q.  14,  a.  3 (Buytaert II, 713, §56) and the interpretation of the latter passage in Denery, 'The Appearance of Reality,' 33-5, 38-9, 44.\n\n61 Scriptum , d. 23, a. 2 (ed. De Rijk, 714, §59): ' Denominari ab aliquo non est esse presens aut apparens denominanti, sed nec esse in conspectu aut prospectu ipsius, et nec illi obici aut offerri; sicut patet quod Cesar pictus non est presens aut apparens picture nec in conspectu aut prospectu illius nec sibi obicitur aut offertur. Sed experientia docet quod res cognita est apparens, presens, obiecta intelligenti necnon et in prospectu aut conspectu illius. Ergo non habet ibi solum denominari, ymo aliquod esse intentionale. '\n\ndenominations  of  that  thing,  but  rather  expressions  of  the  thing  entering  one's phenomenal  experience.  From  the  first-person  perspective,  objective  being  thus  is exactly what brings a phenomenal and conscious aspect to our cognitive experience.\n\nBut the question remains, what is esse apparens from the third-person perspective? What kind of entity is that? Under what metaphysical category does it fall? The problem is that objective being seems to defy the traditional Aristotelian ontology it is neither  substance,  nor  accident.  One  might  wonder  whether  Auriol  construes objective  being  as  a  mode,  similar  to  the  early  modern  ontology  of res and  modes. According  to this latter ontology, there are only things (whether  substantial or accidental)  and  modes  that  modify  these  things.  Modes  are  properties  that  determine the way the things are instantiated. 62 'Appearance' then would be a mode of the thing cognized, something that modifies it - just as, for example, the shade is a mode which modifies the color. Nevertheless, there is one striking problem with taking esse apparens as the mode of the thing. Modes are inseparable from things they modify, not even by God's intervention. But as we have seen, objective being is separable from real things in entirely ordinary  cases,  as  in the  type-(iii) scenarios  above,  e.g.  sensory  illusions. Therefore, it seems that objective being is not to be conceived as a mode of being in the (early) modern metaphysical sense.\n\nI propose instead that apparent or objective being is to be understood as involving a  special  kind  of relation .  Take  a  simple  case  of  seeing  a  wall.  When  the  activity  of  our sight puts the wall into apparent being, it does not add to the thing an absolute entity ( absolutum ) like quality, but only something relational, namely the relation of appearing ( apparere ).  Nevertheless,  this  kind  of  relation  is  different  from  ordinary  relations:  in Auriol's  view,  ordinary  relations  have  no  existence  in  reality,  they  are  brought  to existence  only  by  an  operation  of  an  intellect 63 and  therefore  are  'fixed  on  or superimposed upon the real things'. In contrast, the relation of appearing is the aspect ( respectus or apparitio obiectiva ) under which the thing appears to us: this aspect is both 'indistinguishably joined' to the thing and determined by the kind of cognitive act the thing is grasped by (the same thing appears to the sight and to the intellect differently, under different aspects). Thus, when we see the wall, an aspect under which it appears to us is given to the wall by us. Consequently, that very same wall does not have only its real being, but also the apparent being. In the process of perception our sight is tightly joined\n\n62 However, such ontology is traceable at best from Suárez onwards. For a penetrating account of the category of modes in medieval and early modern philosophy, see R. Pasnau, Metaphysical Themes 12741671 (Oxford, 2011), 244-75.\n\n63 Henninger, 'Peter Aureoli and William of Ockham on Relations,' 234-42.\n\nto the very thing seen and the thing receives a relation toward the sight, i.e. the relation of appearing. 64\n\nAuriol  stresses  an  important  point  here:  perception  or  cognition  (from  the perspective of a cognitive power) or appearing (from the perspective of a thing grasped) is  something  essentially relational . 65 Auriol  refers  to  a  perceptual  relativity  in  order  to stress  the  relational  nature  of  perception:  the  same  thing  can  appear  to  our  senses  in different ways, which depends on various conditions, such as the distance of the object, the condition of our sensory organs etc. Only the set of concrete realizations of these conditions determines the concrete instance of perception, its content and veridicality. 66 Perception is thus a complex arrangement of several components: the perceiving sense, the  thing  perceived,  the  condition  of  medium  etc.  The  terminology  of  objective  or apparent being then gives us an opportunity to describe all the elements included in such cognitive situations. The cognitive situation is a fact that a thing is grasped by an act of a certain  kind  (e.g.  the  act  of  visual  power  gives esse  apparens to  the  wall  and  the  wall receives it) 67 and as a consequence it appears under certain aspect (e.g. as colored: it has the mode of appearing or that kind of esse apparens that gathers visual properties). 68\n\n64 Scriptum ,  d.  27,  p.  2,  a.  2  (E-Scriptum,  lin.  583-98):  '[…] visus  enim,  sive  res  praesens  sit  sive absens, unitur realitati sui obiecti, quam ponit in esse formato, ubi considerandum est quod res in esse formato posita  non  claudit  in  se  aliquid  absolutum  nisi  ipsam  realitatem. […] claudit  tamen  aliquid  respectivum, videlicet apparere. Quod non debet intelligi ut affixum aut superpositum illi rei, sicut ceterae relationes, sed omnino intrinsicum et indistinguibiliter adunatum. Sic igitur, cum aliquis videt parietem sibi obiectum, paries ille non solum habet ibi esse reale, immo esse visum, iudicatum, et intentionale […] idcirco res quae videtur, cum hoc quod realiter existit, habet etiam esse iudicatum et visum, quod quidem non ponit varietatem aliquam aut distinctionem, vel numerum cum realitate illa quantum ad aliquid absolutum, sed addit respectum illum intrinsecum  et  indistinguibilem,  qui  dicitur  'apparitio  obiectiva'. '  For  the  similar  understanding  of esse apparens , see Friedman, 'Act, Species, and Appearance,' 144.\n\n65 Relational understanding of the objective being is also suggested by later Scotus - see P. King, 'Duns Scotus on Mental Content,' in Duns Scot à Paris, 1302-2002 , eds. O. Bulnois, E. Karger, J.-L. Solère, G. Sondag (Turnhout, 2004), 65-88, at 87, or L. Novák, 'Divine Ideas, Instants of Nature, and the Spectre of 'verum esse secundum quid',' Studia Neoaristotelica 9 (2012): 185-203, at 189-90.\n\n66 Scriptum ,  d.  3,  q.  14,  a.  3  (Buytaert II,  712-3, §55). Perceptual relativity is sometimes used as an argument  against  direct  realism  -  see  P.  Le  Morvan,  'Arguments  against  Direct  Realism  and  How  to Counter  Them,' American  Philosophical  Quarterly 41  (2004):  221-34,  at  225-6.  However,  this  argument  is actually aimed against naïve realism, a position Auriol denies (see note 4).\n\n67 For the terminology of 'giving' and 'receiving' esse apparens ,  see Scriptum ,  d.  23,  a. 2 (ed. De Rijk, 718, §70).\n\n68 On  such  a  reading,  it  does  not  make  good  sense  to  ask  whether esse  apparens is  a  mental  or extramental entity: it is both extramental (since the 'bearer' of objective being is - in normal case - the extramental object which appears to us) and mental (since the cognitive act produces this objective being and  is  the  one  to  whom  the  object  appears).  Cf.  Denery,  'The  Appearance  of  Reality,'  36-7  for  similar point.\n\nTo  conclude,  I  propose  that  in  order  to  understand  objective  or  apparent  being properly,  we  should  distinguish  between  two  perspectives:  From  the  third-person ('metaphysical') perspective, esse apparens expresses that there is a cognitive relation: an object x appears to an observer/cognitive power under a certain aspect. From the firstperson ('phenomenological') perspective, esse apparens is the object of our perception (or cognition) as a component of the phenomenal part of our cognitive experience.\n\nIn  my view, this distinction is implied by Auriol himself. Let us consider whether there is a situation when the third- and the first-person perspective yield different results in ascribing a perceptual experience to a perceiver. Auriol would assert that there is such a situation: the phenomenon of selective attention. 69 Take the example of a person A and an object x . Although x is in the visual field of the person A , she is deep in thought about something else and does not pay attention to x . Should we ascribe the perception of x to A ?  From  the  third-person  perspective, A should perceive x -  she  receives  a  quality  or species from x and when the species is in A 's eye, it becomes a cognitive act. However, A does not see x since she is deep in thought - from the first-person perspective, she does not pay attention to x , which is a necessary condition for ascription of the true conscious perceptual experience. Only when she attends to x (which is verifiable only from the firstperson  perspective)  does  the  person  truly  put  the  object  in esse  apparens .  Thus,  the distinction  between  two  kinds  of  perspectives  is  present  in  Auriol's  thought  -  at  least implicitly.\n\nThe  question  remains  whether  this  talk  about  appearances  does  not  give  way, once  again,  to  representationalism.  It  is  worth  stressing  that  Auriol  decisively  denies various  kinds  of  representationalism.  Apart  from  the  arguments  against  the  claim  that species is an  object  of  our  vision  (see  section  II),  elsewhere  he  introduces  other arguments against representationalism: an argument from skepticism (if the representationalism was true we would have  no contact with the external world, only with the contents of our mind, and our knowledge would not be about things but only about  'images'  instead)  and  an  argument  from  parsimony  based  on  a  version  of Ockham's  Razor  (it  is  not  philosophical  (!)  to  postulate  a  plurality  of  things  without  a\n\n69 Scriptum I, d. 35, p. 1, a. 2 (E-Scriptum, lin. 702-8). Although medieval accounts of attention have generally gained less attention of contemporary scholars than they deserve, the topic has received some consideration in the case of Aquinas - cf. Pasnau, Theories of Cognition , 134-46 for sensory attention) or T. S.  Cory,  'Attention, Intentionality and Mind-Reading in Aquinas's De malo 16.8,'  in The Cambridge Critical Guide to Thomas Aquinas's On Evil , ed. M. V. Dougherty (Cambridge, forthcoming) for intellectual attention. The  latter  author  draws  a  distinction  between  metaphysical  and  psychological  aspects  of  cognitive  acts which is similar to the present distinction.\n\nreason - and there is no necessity to postulate a representation to explain cognition; the object, the power and the similitude/act suffice). 70\n\nGiven  these  clear  anti-representationalist  statements,  we  should  not  conceive Auriol's esse apparens as a mediator, as a mental product by grasping which we cognize the thing. If this were the case, 'appearance' would be a cloak ( pallium ) which would veil the thing. 71 Rather, appearance is an aspect ( respectus ) which is so tightly bounded to the thing that it feels as if we grasp the thing itself. Why 'as if'? Because we never grasp an external  thing  exactly  and  fully  the  way  it  really  exists.  One  and  the  same  thing  can appear to us in various ways, and our cognition of it is always selective to an extent. A comparison with the objective being of universals can be instructive:  When we grasp a rose as a universal by a proper act of intellect, we do not grasp a mental entity which would represent all real individual roses; we rather grasp a normal individual rose, just under a certain aspect ,  i.e. under the aspect of universality. The rose appears to us in its universality, leaving aside its particular properties such as being red etc. Similarly, when we see that rose, we perceive it under an aspect of coloration, from one side, etc.\n\nHence, Auriol's theory of perception defends a kind of direct realism which takes at the same time into account phenomenality of perception.\n\n## IV.\n\nSensory  Illusions. It  seems  that  Auriol  has  an  affinity  toward  a  kind  of  direct (perceptual)  realism.  Nevertheless,  there  is  a  generally  known  argument  against  this view, i.e. the argument from illusion. According to this argument, from the premises (1) what  we  see  in  illusion  is  not  a  physical  object  and  (2)  illusion  and  perception  are structurally similar entail the conclusion (3) what we see in illusion is not a physical object. In  other  words,  we  do  not  see  physical  objects  directly,  but  by  being  first  aware  of  a mediator, namely a sense datum, an idea, or a representation. Thus, the argument from illusion can be used in arguing for representationalism. 72 In this section, it will be shown\n\n70 See Scriptum ,  d.  9,  p.  1,  a.  1  (E-Scriptum,  lin.  282-302)  where  Auriol  argues  against  a forma specularis which is  both the real product and the primary object of our intellect (postulated allegedly by Dominicans Aquinas, Hervaeus Natalis and Bernard of Auvergne).\n\n71 Scriptum ,  d.  27,  p.  2,  a.  2  (E-Scriptum,  lin.  598-9):  ' Non igitur terminatur visus ad rem obiectam mediante aliquo absoluto, quasi sit aliquod pallium vel medium inter visionem et parietem qui videtur […]'\n\n72 For the analysis of the argument and similar argument from hallucination and their presuppositions,  see  e.g.  T.  Crane, Elements of Mind. An Introduction to the Philosophy of Mind (Oxford, 2001),  132-7.  For  other  arguments  against  direct  realism,  see  e.g.  Le  Morvan,  'Arguments  against  Direct Realism'.\n\nthat  Auriol  takes  illusory  experiences  into  consideration  in  his  account  of  perception without considering them as a serious threat for his direct realist tendencies.\n\nFirstly,  let  us  consider  Auriol's  famous  account  of  illusions.  He  appeals  to  eight (quite traditional) examples of deceptive perception: e.g. rainbow colors appear to be on a dove's neck in particular lighting, things reflected by mirrors seem to be behind these mirrors, a submerged stick seems to be broken, the twirling of a burning stick seems to leave  a  fire  circle,  etc.  He  also  gives  examples  of  afterimages  or  diplopy. 73 Using  the elimination method, he comes to the conclusion that what we see in illusions does not exist really ( realiter ) but only intentionally ( intentionaliter ), or has an apparent being ( esse apparens ). Comparing  these  examples  with  the  possible  combinations  of  real  and objective being (mentioned in the preceding section), these illusions are instances either of type (ii) (real being and objective being, although the latter one differs from the former in  some  respect,  as  in  the  case  of  the  seemingly  bent  stick)  and  or  of  type  (iii)  (only objective being, as in the case of afterimages). Thus, Auriol deals with two different kinds of illusion at least.\n\nThree further points can be gleaned from Auriol's account of sensory illusions:\n\n- (1)  In  regard  to  the  'act'  pole  of  the  act/object  dichotomy, sensory illusions are instances of perception. The cognitive act of vision ( visio )  is  in  the  power  of  sight both during  a  veridical  perception  and  during  an  illusory  one. 74 The  difference  lies  in  the 'object' pole of the dichotomy: The apparent being of the thing seen is produced in a defective manner in the case of illusion.\n- (2) Auriol seems to affirm that the illusory objects are experienced as though they were outside us. 75 He insists that such illusory appearances exist intentionally outside the percipient - the fire circle (made by twirling of a burning stick) is in the air, the images are behind the  mirrors,  apparent colors are on the  dove's  neck etc. In another place Auriol introduces the following thought experiment: when we see a wall, God could annihilate it and yet conserve our vision of that wall. In such a case, there would be the same wall seen by us: although it would have only intentional existence, it would seem to be in the\n\n73 Scriptum , d. 3, q. 14, a. 1 (Buytaert II, 696-7, §31).\n\n74 See  Auriol's  arguments  against  the  claim  that  illusions  take  place  in  another  cognitive  power, namely  that  they  are  judgments  of  common  sense  (which  was  a  traditional  Aristotelian  view)  ibid. , prooem., q. 2 (Buytaert I, 200-1, §89-92).\n\n75 Pasnau, Theories of Cognition , 69-76 already called attention to this issue.\n\nsame place where it has existed really so far. 76 Besides these examples, Auriol explicitly says that 'the sight judges a terminus of its act of vision to be … in extrinsic space'. 77\n\n(3) The reason why Auriol refers to the illusions is not an epistemic one: he is not arguing for skepticism (senses deceive us and we should not build a theory of cognition on  such  'shaky  foundations'),  or  for  representationalism  (illusions  prove  that  the immediate objects of our acts are not real material objects). 78 On the contrary, Auriol uses these examples as a justification for the belief that our sensory (and, generally, cognitive) powers are essentially active and give an 'apparent being' to their objects. 79\n\nAuriol does not assume that illusory experiences are incompatible with his account of  perception,  which  is  revealed  in  his  answers  to  two  following  questions:  how  an illusion emerges, and in what sense we call what we see in illusions 'objects'.\n\nThe traditional strategy for answering the former question was the one employed by medieval opticians such as Alhacen or Roger Bacon. These thinkers assume that there are  some  preconditions  that  must  be  met  if  the  vision  is  to  occur  at  all  (for  example, distance  between  the  object  and  the  eye,  transparency  of  the  medium,  sufficient magnitude and density of the visible object, healthy eye etc.). 80 If such preconditions are met, the vision is veridical, if not, the vision is inaccurate, deceptive, or does not occur at all.\n\nSimilarly, Peter Auriol analyses veridicality of vision in the terms of fulfilling a set of preconditions. For Auriol, the veridicality of vision lies in the indistinguishability of the real being  of  the  thing  seen  and  the  apparent  or  intentional  being  that  is  produced  by  the sense according to the information in the similitude. Such a situation is achieved under\n\n76 Scriptum , d. 27, p. 2, a. 2 (E-Scriptum, lin. 592-4).\n\n77 '[…] visus non iudicat terminum aliquem suae visionis esse in oculo, immo in spe[c]ulo, si videat per reflexionem, vel in spatio extrinsece, si videat directe. ' -Scriptum , d. 35, p. 2, a. 4 (X 783bC-D).\n\n78 Surprisingly,  Auriol  was  often  read  in  precisely  these  ways  by  both  his  contemporaries  (for Chatton and Ockham see D. Perler, 'Can We Trust our  Senses? Fourteenth-Century Debates  on  Sensory Illusions,' in Uncertain Knowledge. Scepticism, Relativism, and Doubt in the Middle Ages , eds. D. G. Denery, K. Ghosh, N. Zeeman (Turnhout, 2014), 63-90) and modern readers. For instance, the assumption that Auriol uses argument from illusion for representationalism  is explicit  in J. R. Weinberg, Ockham, Descartes, and Hume: Self-knowledge, Substance, and Causality (Madison, 1977), 33-49 and presupposed in Tachau, Vision and Certitude, 89-104, 317. In contrast, Denery, 'The Appearance of Reality,' 29-39 decisively denies that Auriol's appealing to illusions is to be read as the argument from illusion.\n\n79 Scriptum ,  d. 3, q. 14, a. 1 (Buytaert II, 696-7, §31): '[…] actus exterioris sensus ponit rem in esse intentionali, ut patet in multis experientis. '\n\n80 Cf.  the  list  of  the  preconditions  in  Alhacen,  De  aspect.  III,  3  (Alhacen,  'De  aspectibus  I-III,'  in Alhacen's Theory of Visual Perception , ed. A. M. Smith (Philadelphia, 2001), 1-337, at 285, §3.1-3); the detailed analysis is given by Roger Bacon, Perspectiva I, d. 8-9 (ed. Lindberg, 108-44).\n\ncertain circumstances: the thing is present, our sensory organ-eye-is healthy, and we see under 'a direct ray' (and not under a ray reflected by a mirror or refracted by lens). 81 Nevertheless, we sometimes experience non-veridical vision: for example-in the case of afterimages-although the thing is already out of our sensory field, we still see it. 82 What mechanism has such a phenomenal outcome?\n\nDefinitely, this experience does not fall under commands of our will - perception is, ex definitione , not controllable (in the strict sense) by the will (see section I). Rather, it is  an  outcome  of  the  natural  cognitive  mechanism  of  perception  that  was  somehow corrupted. Apparent being produced by such a corrupted process is inaccurate and does not match the real features of the thing seen. Take the example of the iridescent colors that appear to be on a dove's neck. Auriol assumes that 'these colors are nothing else than some kind of appearances produced by means of an impression made by an external thing in the sense'. The content of illusory perception is not produced arbitrarily: since the illusion is an instance of perception, it presupposes that there is an act in our sense. The act occurred in the way every perceptual act occurs: there must be an impression or similitude  in  the  sense  -  'without  such  an  impression  the  eye  cannot  judge  truly  or untruly'. This impression is processed ('judged') and, consequently, the apparent being is produced. Nevertheless, the vision is not veridical and the apparent being differs from the  real  being  (there  are  iridescent  colors  on  the  dove's  neck  which  is  actually  white). How has the distorted impression occurred in the eye? Auriol does not claim that there really is the real thing which would make this impression under normal circumstances (i.e. there are no real rainbow colors on the dove's neck). 'The impression is from a thing, albeit  not  from  the  thing  I  judge  to  be  there,'  concludes  Auriol. 83 In  another  place,  he reveals what he possibly has in mind: 'the light can vary colors - not regarding the way\n\n81 Quodl. q. 8, a. 3 (X 87bD-E): '[…] dum videtur color, non distinguamus inter esse reale coloris et suum esse visum et intentionale, tamen dum est detrahitur color et remanet visio in habentibus molles oculos, remanet etiam color secundum esse sensatum apparens et intentionale. […] dum obiecta sunt praesenta et videntur per lineam rectam absque ullo errore, tunc esse sensatum et esse reale sunt simul in eodem situ, et tamen esse intentionale habet in reali sustentari, quamvis dum videntur per lineam fractam aut reflexam , esse sensatum, quod est esse imaginis, et esse intentionale differat et distet a vero situ rei visae. '\n\n82 Remember Auriol's claim that the actual presence of the thing is not the necessary condition for perception,  only  for  a veridical perception  -  cf. Scriptum ,  prooem.,  q.  2,  a.  3  (Buytaert  I,  200,  §91)  and section I.\n\n83 Cf. Rep. II, d. 13, q. 1 (X 181aC-D; F 66va-vb; P 60va): ' Non sunt ergo ( igitur F) colores huiusmodi nisi quedam apparencie obiective facte quidem mediante impressione facta in sensu a re extra, qua facta res apparet aliter quam est, et ideo visiones multe possunt esse false et possunt esse de re, que non est. Non dico, quin requiratur res aliqua faciens impressionem aliquam in visu - sine tali enim impressione non potest oculus iudicare  vere  et ( vel P) false  -  sed  dico  de  re,  que  non  est;  quia  iudicato  resultanti  ex  tali  impressione,  non correspondet aliquid in re extra ita, quod impressio licet fiat ex aliqua re, non tamen a re, quam iudico ibi esse. '\n\nthey really exist, but regarding the way they appear'. 84 A species of light can intervene in the  similitude  of  color  received  in  our  sense.  Although  the  information  included  is distorted, the sense still does its job. The similitude is processed and transformed into the act;  and  the  act  produces esse  apparens according  to  the  information  included.  As  a result, the cognitive act is illusory.\n\nThe other question is whether we can call what we perceive in illusion 'objects'. Robert Pasnau has already called attention to the question of what the ontological status of  such  illusory  appearances  is. 85 He  proposes  two  possible  readings  of  Auriol:  either these appearances are objects similar to present day abstract objects, i.e. some entities endowed by 'a mysterious twilight sort of existence' and their nature is never clearly explained, or Auriol simply wants to say that something appears to be there because he may think  that  it  is  'useful  to  analyze  appearances  as  if  they  were  objects'.  Although both readings seem unconvincing to Pasnau (Auriol is 'either claiming something highly implausible or making  a perfectly unexceptional claim in a highly exceptionable manner'), I assume that the latter reading of Auriol is at least plausible and that it does show his theory as having some merits.\n\nI assume that illusory appearances are 'objects' only in a broad sense of the word. Auriol  himself  distinguishes  several  senses  of  the  phrase  'object  of  the  (cognitive) power'. 86 For  our  purposes,  the  two  following  meanings  are  significant.  In  the  first meaning, x can be called the 'object of an act' in the sense of a mover ( motive ), because x brings the faculty into actuality ( actuat eam ) and is the moving cause ( ratio motiva ) of the act. In that meaning, the entities that affect faculties and take part in eliciting their acts are called 'objects'. E. g., the redness of this apple is the object of my act of vision, because it makes an impression in my eye and this impression is turned into the act and puts the original quality into apparent being. However, in another sense, y is  called the 'object of an act' only terminative : although the act 'terminates' at y , the moving cause of that act can be something completely different from y . E. g., we grasp apparent colors on the dove's neck by an illusory act, but there are no such colors which would be the moving cause of the act (as was said, in such cases information in species was distorted in some manner). The 'objects' in a terminative sense are thus something having objective\n\n84 Ibid. (X 183aD-E; F 67va; P 61rb): '[…] dico quod lux potest variare colores non quantum ad rem, sed quantum ad apparenciam. Unde si lux fuerit multum intensa, videtur quandoque color albus, ut patet in lumine  solis  in  meridie  et  lumine  lune (om.  P) ,  que  albedo  non  est  ibi  secundum  rem,  sed  tantum  in  esse iudicato (tantummodo esse mediatum ? F) ' .\n\n85 Pasnau, Theories of Cognition , 74-6.\n\n86 Scriptum , d. 2, q. 10, a. 4 (Buytaert II, 544-5, §82). Auriol's main aim in this article is the question what is the object of intellect - see Goris, 'Implicit Knowledge,' 56-62 or J. A. Aertsen, Medieval Philosophy as Transcendental Thought: from Philip the Chancellor (ca. 1225) to Francisco Suárez (Leiden, 2012), 445-7.\n\nbeing without having  respective  real  being.  On  the  level  of  senses  these  are  illusory appearances;  on  the  level  of  intellect,  such  'objects'  would  be  universals,  relations, privations etc. 87\n\nAuriol's  'objects  in  the  terminative  sense'  are  anticipated  to  a  certain  extent  in the earlier Franciscan tradition. For example, Peter Olivi affirms that external things are only terminative causes of cognitive acts, since the sole author of the acts is the cognitive power. 88 Although  Auriol  is  more  traditional  regarding  the  veridical  perception  (in  this case the object by means of the similitude is a partial cause of the act, together with the power), he is rather 'Olivian' in the case of the non-veridical perception (the 'objects' of such perceptual acts are objects only in the terminative sense, not in the sense of being the motive causes of these acts).\n\nHence, I contend that Auriol is not to be understood as speaking about full-fledged intentional objects , entities  endowed  with  a  special  ontological  status.  Auriol  rather seems  to  assert  that  we  can  talk  about  what  appears  to  us  as  about  objects  having properties regardless of their actual existence. When we are talking about perception, the term 'object' means either 'the moving cause of the perceptual act' (in the third-person perspective), or 'what appears to us' / 'what the perceptual act 'terminates' at' (in the first-person perspective). Both approaches are possible in the case of veridical perception; however the latter one is more common in the case of illusion.\n\nTo sum up, there are two kinds of illusion: the first type when a real thing appears to be different than it really is (as in the case of the seemingly iridescent dove's neck or the seemingly broken stick), and the second type when something that does not exist really  appears  to  us  (as  in  the  case  of  afterimages,  or  a  fire  circle  in  the  air  made  by twirling a burning stick or). Moreover, I assume that it is useful to distinguish between the  first-  and  third-person  perspectives.  From  the  third-person  perspective,  there  is  a special kind of relation (the relation of 'appearing') among an object, a perceiver and the aspect  under  which  the  object  appears.  But  to  what  entity  does  the  perceiver  have  a relation in the case of fire circle? It may be a possible entity: 89 The doctrine of objective being  enables  us  to  describe  what  the  cognitive  relation  between  the  act  and  the (possible) object would be, if the world were as presented by the similitude/act. From the first-person perspective: we  have  perceptual experiences of apparent  objects or apparent properties of real objects - such as iridescent dove's neck or fire circles being in\n\n87 Cf . Scriptum , d. 2, q. 10, a. 4 (Buytaert II, 549-50, §99).\n\n88 Cf. Sent . II, q. 72 (ed. Jansen III, 36-7) and J. Toivanen, Perception and the Internal Senses: Peter of John Olivi on the Cognitive Functions of the Sensitive Soul , (Leiden, 2013), 145-50.\n\n89 However, Auriol is not explicit about it.\n\nthe air. The reason is that the preconditions of veridical perception are not fulfilled and the perceptual process is corrupted.\n\nAre  these  illusory  appearances  extramental?  They are ,  to  some  extent:  we  can localize the mirror images using geometry, for example. What Auriol asserts is that they appear to be extramental. Iridescent colors seem to be extramental since the neck they appear to be in is extramental. Further, the constitutive feature of perception is having an object  (or,  at  least,  an  'object'  in  the  terminative  sense)  which  is  perceived  as  being localized in a place (see section I).\n\nHence,  illusions  are  in  Auriol's  view  examples  of  defective  perception.  As  such, they are analyzable by means of the act/object dichotomy, they even have 'objects' (in the broad sense of the word). As was shown, Auriol's reference to them is not intended as an argument for representationalism.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## V.\n\nThis paper has argued for the thesis that Auriol's proposes a kind of direct realist theory of perception (we perceive the real external objects directly, not by means of a mediator as representationalism asserts). Auriol's major contribution lies in the application of the (mainly Scotistic) doctrine of objective being to the domain of sensory experience. He uses the doctrine as many others did: for preserving  both direct-realist intuitions and the act/object analysis even in cases of illusion.\n\nHis strategy has some advantages. For instance, it enables him to uphold a nonnaïve  version  of  direct  realism  in:  Being  able  to  preserve  realistic  intuitions,  Auriol  can stress  both  the  passive  and  the  active  moments  of  perceptual  experience  (i.e.  the reception  of  the  similitude  in  the  faculty  and  its  further  processing  here),  cope  with perceptual  relativity  (the  same  thing  can  appear  to  us  differently  under  different circumstances), express the phenomenal ingredient in our cognitive states, and treat the content  of  illusory  experience  using  the  notions  similar  to  the  ones  usually  used  for  a description  of  material  objects.  The  further  advantage  of  the  theory  lies  in  its  general applicability: every cognitive (and even appetitive) experience is analyzable as an act of the respective faculty that puts its object into apparent or objective being.\n\nThe  major  disadvantage  of  Auriol's  theory  lies  in  the  fact  that  it  can  be  read skeptically: How can we be certain that esse apparens of our act's object coincides with its real being? Such epistemic questions were raised in the next generation of scholars by, for  instance,  Ockham,  Chatton  or  Wodeham. 90 Auriol  seems  to  be  unaware  of  such\n\n90 See Wood, 'Adam Wodeham on Sensory Illusions,' and Perler, 'Can We Trust our Senses?'.\n\nskeptical consequences of his theory of perception. As for such epistemic questions, he probably had a tendency toward a reliabilistic attitude (which was common also among the  contemporary  opticians):  the  perception  is  veridical  as  long  as  it  is  a  product  of  a reliable and uncorrupted process. 91\n\n91 The  research  behind  this  article  was  supported  by  the  Scholarship  of  the  Jan  Hus  Educational Foundation and by the scholarship of the Moravian-Silesian Region (project 'Podpora vědy a výzkumu v Moravskoslezském kraji 2014', no. 02679/2014/RRC).
