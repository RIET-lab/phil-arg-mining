In  this  reply  to  Professor  Hookway's  lecture  the  comments  are focused,  first,  on  the  topic  of  what  dichotomies  really  are,  since  it  is  an illuminating way of understanding pragmatism in general and Putnam's pragmatism  in  particular.  Dichotomies  are  artifacts  that  we  devise  with  some useful purpose in mind, but when inflated into absolute dichotomies they become metaphysical  bogeys  as  it  is  illustrated  by  the  twentieth  century  distinction between  fact  and  value.

In  his  brilliant  lecture,  Hookway  pays  particular attention to the first and  second  chapters  of The  Collapse  of  the Fact/Value  Dichotomy ,  and  to  its  final  chapter:  'The  Philosophers  of Science's Evasion of Values' (Putnam 2002).\n\nIn my brief comments I will deal first with the topic of dichotomies, which is an illuminating way of understanding pragmatism in general and\n\nIn: U.

Austin, from whom I have selected a quote as a motto for my paper.\n\n## 1. Dichotomies\n\nFirst  of  all,  I  want  to  say  in  advance  that  I  am  in  agreement  with Hookway's general presentation of Putnam's approach to distinctions and dichotomies. I will add here some  comments  of  a historical and lexicographic character in order to gain a clearer view of the whole issue that  may  help  to  understand  better  pragmatism  in  general  and  Putnam's pragmatism in particular.\n\nIn the introduction to Classical American Philosophy ,  a  collection of writings  of  Peirce,  James,  Royce,  Santayana,  Dewey  and  Mead,  John J. Stuhr identifies seven characteristics that constitute a 'family resemblance' amongst the six  major  American  pragmatist  philosophers. The  first  such  characteristic  is  the  rejection  of  modern  philosophy's 'dualism,'  i.e.  its  habit  of  articulating  and  defending  its  positions  in terms  of  dichotomies:  subject/object,  mind/matter,  appearance/reality, theory/practice,  facts/values,  individual/community,  and  so  on.  Stuhr explains:\n\nClassical American philosophers did not refuse to use these terms; instead their  point  was  that  these  notions  refer  to  distinctions  made  in  thought rather  to  different  kinds  of  being  or  levels  of  existence.  That  is,  these terms have a functional rather an ontological status; they stand for useful distinctions made within reflection, and not for different kinds of being, discrete and separate prior to reflection. (Stuhr 1987, p. 5)\n\nIn The  Collapse  of  the  Fact/Value  Dichotomy Hilary  Putnam  aligns himself  with  this  honorable  tradition,  crediting  John  Dewey's  lifelong battle against dualisms as a source of inspiration For Putnam, distinctions are not dualisms or dichotomies (Putnam 2002, p. 9). 'The errors [. . .]' Hookway  writes  -  'arise  only  when  such  distinctions  are  transformed into  'dichotomies.'  Indeed  Putnam  agrees  with  Dewey  that,  in  these cases  we  need  both  to  understand  'the  importance  of  respecting  the distinction' [Putnam 2002, p. 10] while recognizing the damaging effects of inflating it into a dichotomy' (Hookway 2004, pp. 1-2). On Putnam's account,  harmless  and  innocent  distinctions  become  -  at  least  in  some cases  -  metaphysical  bogeys  when  inflated  into  absolute  dichotomies. 'One  difference  between  an  ordinary  distinction  and  a  metaphysical\n\ndichotomy [is that] ordinary distinctions have ranges of application, and we are not surprised if they do not always apply' (Putnam 2002, p. 11).\n\nBut  let  us  stop  here  for  a  while.  What  is  a  dichotomy?  In  order  to answer this type of question I always love to go to Baldwin's Dictionary (1901-1905),  which  from  time  to  time  gives  the  gift  of  an  entry  by Charles  S.  Peirce.  In  the  case  of  'dichotomy'  the  entry  is  by  Robert Adamson, professor of Logic at Glasgow University, but Peirce is the coauthor  of  a  related  entry  'Dualism  (in  Philosophy).'  Here  is  Peirce's definition of 'dualism':\n\n- (1)  A  general  tendency  to  divide  any  genus  of  objects  of  philosophical thought  into  two  widely  separate  categories,  as  saints  and  sinners,  truth and  falsehood,  &amp;c.;  opposed  to  the  tendency  to  look  for  gradations intermediate between contraries. Especially (2) any theory which explains the facts of the universe by referring them  to the action of two independent  and  eternally  coexistent  principles.  (Baldwin  1901-1905,  I, p. 298)\n\nIn his entry on 'dichotomy,' Adamson explains that a dichotomy is 'a form of logical division in which, at each step, the genus is separated into two  species,  determined  by  the  possession  and  non  possession,  the presence and absence, of a mark or attribute. The species so determined satisfy the rules of division: they exclude one another, and they exhaust the extent of the genus divided.' Adamson describes cursorily the use of dichotomy  by  Plato  and  Aristotle,  and  suggests  that  the  method  of division by dichotomy 'lies at the foundation of Jevons' and indeed of all symbolic  logic,'  because  it  'expresses  the  fundamental  distinction  in thought between position and negation' (Baldwin 1901-1905, I, p. 279).\n\nThe point I want to stress is that a 'dichotomy' is mainly a form of logical  division,  of  classification;  that  dichotomies  appear  when  and where there are human beings thinking, classifying, establishing classes, collections and categories. To assert a dichotomy is to cut something into two parts which are 'mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive' (Brody 1967, p. 60). This cut is a logical one, made by our reflection: it could be said that if were nobody to do the cutting there would be no dichotomies. I  like  to  tell  my  students  that  in  the  middle  of  the  sun  there  are  no problems;  that  problems  only  appear  where  there  are  human  beings thinking. The same could be said of dichotomies. In the world there are no dichotomies, but only continuity and interaction. Along this way, the only  two  ontological  usages  of  'dichotomy'  found  in  dictionaries  -  for instance  the Oxford  English  Dictionary -  come  from  astronomy  ('That phase  of  the  moon,  (or  of  an  inferior  planet)  at  which  exactly  half  the\n\ndisk  appears  illuminated')  and  from  botany  ('A  form  of  branching  in which each successive axis divides into two; repeated bifurcation').\n\nBut  the  phenomenon  that  Putnam  has  detected  is  the  metaphysical inflation of a distinction that transforms a logical division into a metaphysical dichotomy, 'thought to be philosophically obligatory, both sides of the distinction were thought to be natural kinds, each a category whose members possessed an 'essential property' in common' (Putnam 2002,  p.  13).  This  could  be  a  new  usage  of  the  term  'dichotomy'.  We human  beings  are  very  fond  of  making  this  type  of  division  into  two parts, and then promptly to forget that the division was made by us , with some practical purpose in mind in each case. We are tempted to believe that reality is divided in two according our dichotomy. As Putnam shows in detail, the transformation of a distinction into a metaphysical dichotomy turns the distinction into a Procrustean bed (cf. Putnam 2002, p. 27).  Let's  recall  the  story  from  Greek  mythology:  Procrustes  was  a bandit from Attica who had a bed which he invited passersby to lie down in.  Those who were shorter than the bed he would stretch until they fit, while those who were too tall would have their legs chopped short.\n\n## 2. Ethical Concepts and Artifact Terms\n\nIn  his  book,  Putnam  demonstrates  convincingly  that  'the  fact/value dichotomy is, at bottom, not a distinction but a thesis ,  namely the thesis that  'ethics'  is  not  about  'matters  of  fact''  (Putnam  2002,  p.  19). Putnam  identifies  three  reasons  why  we  are  tempted  to  establish  the fact/value dichotomy. The first (and more dangerous) reason is that, like the  Procrustean  bed,  this  dichotomy  is  a  way  of  cutting  off  not  only rational argument about values, but even thought: 'The worst thing about the  fact/value  dichotomy is that in practice it functions as a discussionstopper; and not just a discussion-stopper, but a thought-stopper' (Putnam  2002,  p.  44).  As  Putnam  has  written  extensively  elsewhere  'a central insight in Dewey's ethics (and all of Dewey's work is in one way or another connected with 'ethics') is that the application of intelligence to  moral  problems  is  itself  a  moral  obligation '  (Putnam  2000,  p.  10). This  is  the  core  of  pragmatism  and  the  distinctive  mark  of  philosophy itself, and has been in the heart and in the texts of Putnam for at least the last  two  decades. Philosophy, as understood and lived by him, is 'to do what  Socrates  tried  to  teach  us:  to  examine  who  we  are  and  what  our deepest  convictions  are  and  hold  those  convictions  up  to  the  searching test of reflective examination' (Putnam 2002, p. 44).\n\nIn his lecture, Chris Hookway pays special attention to the entanglement  of  fact  and  value  that  appears  in  the  use  of  words  like 'cruel',  that  have  a  mixed  descriptive  and  normative  function.  Putnam holds  that  'the  so-called  thick  ethical  concepts  are  counterexamples  to the claim that there is an absolute fact/value dichotomy' (Hookway 2004, p. 4; cf. Putnam 2002, p. 35), and he adds that this has long been pointed out by Philippa Foot, Iris Murdoch, John MacDowell and David Wiggins in  their  criticisms  of  the  dichotomy.  Putnam  discusses  with  some  detail the answers of R.M. Hare and John Mackie to those criticisms, but before doing so he announces that a possible Humean response would be just to banish  all  thick  ethical  concepts  to  the  limbo  of  the  'emotive'  or 'noncognitive' right along with the 'thin' ones ('good,' 'ought,' 'right' et al. ). This would be a highly impoverished language. Putnam continues,\n\nFor  a  Spanish  reader  this  historical  reference  Not  even  David  Hume would be willing to classify, for example, 'generous,' 'elegant,' 'skillful,'  'strong,' 'gauche,' 'weak,' or 'vulgar' as concepts to which no  'fact'  corresponds  (Putnam  2002,  35).  [And  in  a  footnote  Putnam adds] The words quoted in this sentence were listed as examples by José Ortega  y  Gasset,  who  noticed  the  phenomenon  of  entanglement  very early.  See  his Obras  Completas ,  vol.  6  (Madrid:  Revista  de  Occidente, 1923). (Putnam 2002, pp. 317 and 320-321)\n\nFor a Spanish reader this historical reference - which already appears in Putnam's 'Pragmatism and Relativism: Universal Values and Traditional Ways of Life' (Putnam 1994, pp. 188-189) - makes a lot of sense.  The  quotation  from  Ortega  proceeds  from  his  'Introducción  a  la estimativa'  of  1918:  it  was  his  address  for  entering  into  the  ' Real Academia de Ciencias Morales y Políticas ' of Spain. I have defended for years  -  with  small  success  until  now!  -  the  deep  affinity  between American pragmatism and Hispanic philosophers of the early decades of the  twentieth  century,  such  as  Unanumo,  Ortega  and  d'Ors  (Nubiola 1998).  In  the  case  of  Ortega,  John  Graham  published  in  1994  a  careful study in which, after noting Ortega's hostility to American pragmatism, he reveals 'many basic connections, similarities and points of identity, so that concrete influence and dependence seem  more  plausible than 'coincidence'  between  Ortega  and  James.'  Graham  gives  evidence  that Ortega  read  James  early  in  his  career,  and  that  Ortega  was  aware  that James had anticipated the notion central to his of ' razón vital ' (Graham 1994, pp. 145 and 147-152; see also Barzun 1984, p. 299). His evidence of James' influences on Ortega by German sources themselves influenced by James is specially convincing (Donoso 1995, p. 499).\n\nBack to the main line of my comment: Putnam's discussion of these thick  ethical  concepts  show  clearly  the  deep  entanglement  of  fact  and value or - what in the end is the same - that the dichotomy, as a sharp division,  is  really  impossible,  as  it  is  said  by  Claudine  Tiercelin  in  her delightful book on Putnam:\n\nThe border between fact and value is faint: the terms considered to have a function  of  ethical  evaluation  have  also  a  descriptive  explicative  and predictive  function.  When  somebody is  qualified  as  'scrupulous,'  at  the same time one evaluates his or her character, one describes it. Understanding  a  human  being  is  a  mixture  of  estimation  of  his  or  her character and  of explication and  prediction of his or her actions'. (Tiercelin 2002, p. 50)\n\nIn  his  lecture,  Hookway  skillfully  describes  the  problem  of  the mixture of evaluation and description that appears in these thick ethical concepts. However, for me the most interesting aspect is the unexpected turn that his reflection makes when he asks himself how far this strategy extends:\n\nIs  it  applied  solely  to  words  (like  'cruel'  and  'kind',  for  example)  that really do seem to have a centrally ethical or evaluative use? The question is:  if  this  argument  works  for  thick  ethical  concepts,  how  far  does  its application extend? Are there concepts that we would superficially think of as 'descriptive' to which it applies? (Hookway 2004, p. 5).\n\nHookway chooses an excellent example in order to test the extension of  the  'semantic  strategy'  against  the  fact/value  distinction:  a  'lamp'. This is the name of an artifact that surreptitiously - it is the same with all artifacts -reintroduces in the scene a mixture  of description  and evaluation:\n\nWe might think of a 'lamp' as a wholly descriptive concept - certainly it does  not  embody  any ethical evaluation.  But  identifying  something  as  a lamp involves  regarding  it  as  having  a  distinctive use ,  as  meeting  some need or purpose. Nobody who failed to grasp how lamps are used, nobody who  could  not  evaluate  how  suitable  something  was  to  meet  the  needs which lamps are designed to need, could properly apply the concept of a lamp  as  we  do:  a  sensitivity  to  how  we  evaluate  things  as  meeting  the needs  which  lamps  are  designed  to  meet  seems  to  be  required  for applying  the  term  and  assessing  what  falls  in  its  extension.  (Hookway 2004, p. 5)\n\nWhat is it to be a lamp? Is 'lamp' in fact a pure descriptive term, or does  not  its  use  involve  some  evaluation  about  the  extension  of  the concept? As most of the readers of this volume know, Putnam's view on\n\nnatural-kind terms as indexical can be extended also to artifacts. 'Pencil', 'chair'  or  'bottle'  were  the  terms  used  by  Putnam  as  paradigmatic examples in 'The Meaning of 'Meaning'':\n\n- [. . .] 'pencil' is not synonymous with any description - not even loosely synonymous with a loose description. When we use a word 'pencil', we intend to refer to whatever has the same nature as the normal examples of the  local  pencils  in  the  actual  world.  'Pencil'  is  just  as  indexical  as 'water' or 'gold'. (Putnam 1975, p. 243)\n\nAccording to Putnam, the nature of a pencil or of a lamp is not some mysterious  structure  underlying  the  surface  characteristics  of  the  object (for a discussion of this issue, see S.P. Schwartz 1978 and H. Kornblith 1980).  With  Aristotle  we  can  say  that  the  essence  of  an  artifact  is extrinsic to the artifact, is its utility, while the matter of its composition is accidental (Aristotle, Physics II, 2, 1929b 8-20): the function or utility of the artifact is the nature referred to by the user of the term 'lamp' or 'pencil'.\n\nMoreover, when we think about what it is to be a 'proper lamp' or a 'good  lamp,'  we  realize  that  there  is  some  hidden  evaluation  that governs  the  pragmatic  application  of  the  term,  as  Hookway's  argument suggests. I agree with that, but my minor reply is that there are no sharp boundaries about what it is to be a lamp: a broken lamp or a miner's lamp are also lamps, in spite of the fact that I cannot use them on my desk. (By the way, Hookway has credited Peirce for the example of the lamp, and looking in Peirce's Collected  Papers I found  that there are eight occurrences  of  'lamp'  there,  and  one  of  them  is  'Aladdin's  lamp'! [Peirce 1931-1958, 6.552, 1887]) Let me quote here one of Wittgenstein's comments  about lamps and their boundaries in his Philosophical Investigations :\n\nOne may say of certain objects  that  they  have  this  or  that  purpose.  The essential thing is that this is a lamp, that it serves to give light; - that it is an ornament to the room, fills an empty space, etc., is not essential. But there is not always a sharp distinction between essential and inessential. (Wittgenstein 1953, p. 62)\n\nHaving all this in mind, the last point I want to make in this section is that  any  dichotomy,  like  the  fact/value  dichotomy  (which  has  been consistently  rejected  by  Putnam  as  a  metaphysical  bogey),  is  also  an artifact , a product of the human mind. It seems to me really important to realize  that  'dichotomies'  are  tools  like  lamps,  drawn  to  get  a  clearer view of some area of philosophical discussion or in this case - as it was said earlier - unfortunately to stop any discussion at all. The making of\n\ndichotomies was perhaps seen by the vast majority of our colleagues in the past century as a useful tool to make philosophical progress; thanks, however, to Putnam's work we now  realize that this distinction, especially when metaphysically inflated, blocks inquiry and distorts our view of rationality and human flourishing. We know now what the classic pragmatists  already  knew:  that  facts  and  values  interpenetrate,  that 'value judgments are essential to the practice of science itself ' (Putnam 2002, p. 135). From a practical point of view, we have learned that the dichotomy  between  value  judgments  and  judgments  of  facts  was  not really a dichotomy, i.e. a division of the judgments into two sub-classes mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive. Rather, it was an ideological thesis made in order to avoid philosophical discussion about values. This provides ample reason for the negative overtones of the term 'dichotomy' in Putnam's writings.\n\n## 3. A Final Word on J.L. Austin\n\nAlmost  thirty  years  ago  I  did  my  licentiate  thesis  on  John  Austin's analysis of truth, working  closely on his William  James  Lectures (delivered at Harvard in 1955 and published posthumously as How to Do Things  with  Words ).  Over  the  last  ten  years  I  have  been  teaching regularly  Austin's  philosophy  of  language,  and  I  am  persuaded  of  the deep affinity  between Austin and the pragmatist tradition. In a footnote to  chapter  seven  of The Collapse of the Fact/Value Dichotomy ,  Putnam writes:  'Most of the points I have attributed to 'American pragmatism' in this chapter are also made by Austin - who, like Murdoch, appears not to have  read the pragmatists' (Putnam  2002,  p. 171, n.  24).  My impression  is  that  the  view  of  language  that  Austin  presents  in  the  last lecture of How to Do Things with Words fits pretty well with a pragmatist approach to language.\n\nBut  the  point  I  want  to  highlight  here  is  not  only  that  John  Austin, like  Putnam,  advocates  the  elimination  of  the  contrast  between  the normative  or  evaluative  and  the  factual,  but  he  characterizes  of  this dichotomy  in  lecture  XII  as  a  ' fetish .'  According  to  the  dictionary,  a fetish is something 'that is worshiped, because a spirit is believed to live in  it,'  or  'to  which  more  respect  or  attention  is  given  than  is  normal  or sensible'  (Cowie  1990,  p.  449).  What  Hilary  Putnam  has  shown  is  that the 'scientific spirit' that was  embodied  by  that fetish is simply unscientific, and not only does not deserve any respect at all, but on the contrary  has  to  be  denounced  systematically  as  a  treason  to  philosophy\n\nand  an  attack  on  human  flourishing.  This  is  one  of  the  treasures  of  the heritage of American pragmatism, and Putnam has been instrumental and influential in its rediscovery.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nI  want  to  give  thanks  to  Concepción  Martínez  and  to  Maria  Uxia  Rivas for their kind invitation to take part as a discussant of professor Hookway in the II Meeting on Pragmatism held in Santiago de Compostela, on May 13-14, 2004.
