Meinong's reflection on aesthetics stems from a psychological background and subsequently receives an ontological grounding. After examining the notions of imagination, phantasy-representation, relation and complexion, I show how both the theory of production of representations and that of higher-order objects develop under the impulse of Ehrenfels' concept of Gestalt quality; both these theories may be applied to aesthetics in the explanation of artistic creation and of aesthetic objects. Meinong identifies the specific object of aesthetics with the objective and  distinguishes  aesthetic  feelings,  which  are  true  feelings,  from  imaginary ones.  Witasek  develops  a  psychological  aesthetics  built  on  the  conceptual framework of Meinongian philosophy: aesthetic properties are ideal and extraobjective, they connect the aesthetic object to the subject's mental attitude; an aesthetic object is an object endowed with aesthetic properties, such as beauty, which depends on the degree of pleasure or displeasure the object may induce in the subject. Witasek, though, parts from Meinong as regards both the role of objectives, which he views as mere intermediaries of beauty, and the conception of imaginary and aesthetic feelings. In the last part, I present the reactions to Witasek's aesthetics, both positive and negative, within the Graz school itself, and I sketch Ehrenfels' and Veber's aesthetic views.\n\n## 1. Preliminary remarks\n\nThe aesthetics of the Graz school is laid out essentially in the works of Alexius Meinong (1853-1920) and Stephan Witasek (1870-1915). Other representatives who have dealt with aesthetics are Christian von Ehrenfels (1859-1932),  an  early  pupil  of  Meinong's  who  may  be  regarded  as  a member of the school if the latter is understood in a wide sense - as Meinong himself does in the 'Selbstdarstellung' -, and France Veber (18901975),  one  of  Meinong's  last  pupils.  Besides,  Rudolf Ameseder  (18771937),  Alois  Höfler  (1853-1922),  Robert  Saxinger  (1864-?)  and  Ernst Schwarz (1878-1938) also wrote works which may be indexed under the heading 'aesthetics'.\n\nDespite being in the forefront between the late nineteenth and early twentieth  century,  the  reflections  on  aesthetics  produced  by  the  Graz school are relatively neglected nowadays, to the point of being completely missing from many textbooks on the history of the discipline; yet, looking at  the  specific  themes  they  addressed,  such  reflections  are  still  present, consciously or not, in the aesthetic debates of contemporary philosophers. Therefore, the choice of devoting the present volume of Meinong Studies to the aesthetic theories of the Graz school is not motivated by mere historical  interest  (although  contributions  of  a  historical  nature  are  also  included):  it  arises  precisely  from  the  belief  that  these  theories  have  retained a lot of their theoretical significance. Some of the essays collected here provide strong evidence in this sense. Furthermore, they clarify the true extent of such significance. Present-day reflections on Meinong and his followers generally underscore and develop the theory of fictitious objects;  nonetheless,  confining  our  understanding  of  the  aesthetics  of  the Graz school to this  aspect  would  mean  playing  down  the  variety  of  the themes addressed by these authors, which range from musical to narrative aesthetics, from the theory of emotions to the theory of values, from the aesthetic experience to aesthetic properties and objects, from the creative activity of the artist to the analysis of aesthetic judgments. The way Meinong comes to elaborate his theories is itself very revealing of the complexity and variety of the interests he entertains in this discipline.\n\n## 2. Meinong: from psychology to aesthetics\n\nThe semantics of narrative discourse and the ontology of art are two disciplinary areas where Meinong's philosophy has been largely applied in the last few decades - or at least, where it has received and receives more attention. As I mentioned, current discussions hinge for the most part on his  theory  of  fictitious  objects, 1 but  in  fact,  he  addressed  several  other aesthetic issues, to the extent that - in my view - it is legitimate to speak of  Meinong's aesthetics, although his theories on the subject have to be drawn from a plurality of texts. Rather than devoting a specific writing to aesthetics, he dealt with it as part of wider contexts, following a path that stems from a psychological background, moves to ontology, and finally leads  to  full-fledged  aesthetic  theories.  These  are  integrated  into  a  very general philosophical conception, which purports to account for the world as a whole, hence also for aesthetic facts, objects and experiences. Thus, in  order  to  fully  appreciate  Meinong's  point  of  view  on  aesthetics,  we need to bear in mind some of his psychological theses, and at least the general  outlines  of  the  object  theory.  The  result  will  be  a  complex  aesthetic theory, but not an accomplished one - which is precisely the reason why  it  lends  itself  to  further  developments,  or  to  be  incorporated  into wider views.\n\nMeinong spent his university years in Vienna (1870-1874) studying mainly history and German philology, and eventually received a PhD in history in 1874, with a thesis on Arnold of Brescia. Prior to that, he had managed  to  attend  courses  in  art  history  with  Rudolf  Eitelberger  von Edelberg  (1817-1885)  and  in  musicology  with  Eduard  Hanslick  (18251904). The  former  had  been  teaching  at  the  University  of  Vienna  since 1852; he became a full professor of art history in 1863 and, from the following year, he held at the same time the post of Director of the Österreichisches Museum für Kunst und Industrie. Hanslick was the first to hold a\n\n1 Even though Nevia Dolcini's and Francesco Orilia's contributions to this volume do not deal specifically with Meinong, but with single aspects of the theory of fiction, they testify the presence of Meinongian themes within the present debates on fictitious objects, and the extent to which his reflection has shaped such debates.\n\ncourse  in  music  at  the  University  of  Vienna,  while  still  a Privatdozent (1856); his qualification essay Vom Musikalisch-Schönen , written in 1854, earned  him  the  rank  of  extraordinary  professor  in  1861;  after  obtaining full professorship in 1869, he taught history and aesthetics of music until 1894. 2 A staunch critic of the aesthetics of feelings, Hanslick contended that the essence of music lies neither in the description nor in the arousal of  feelings,  but  in  'resounding  animated  forms  [ tönend  bewegten  Formen ].' He was succeeded by Guido Adler (1855-1941), whose long-time friendship  with  Meinong is  witnessed  by  their  frequent  correspondence, scattered with discussions on music. 3\n\nIt  is  difficult  to  ascertain  in  what  ways  these  scholars  possibly  had some  effect  on  Meinong's  subsequent  reflections  on  aesthetics.  It  is known that he always had a great passion for music - in the 'Selbstdarstellung' he even confesses having cherished the idea of taking up music as  a  profession 4 -  as  well  as  for  literature,  although  the  latter  does  not really seem to surface in his writings. Evelyn Dölling recalls that, due to Meinong's very poor eyesight, he and his wife Doris had discovered the pleasure of reading together ('das gemeinsame Lesen'), so that Doris had become his reader not only for scientific literature, but also for novels. 5 Music and literature are the arts that Meinong is mostly referring to, when he discusses aesthetics understood as the philosophy of art.\n\nSince Meinong never wrote any work specifically on aesthetics, several  threads of thought may be highlighted in his writings, as shown by some contributions to this volume. Meinong's aesthetic research may be traced back to his 1894 inquiry on value theory, 6 as Dale Jacquette does in his extensive essay, where he expounds and defends a Meinongian subjectivistic  aesthetic  value  theory.  Or  else,  following  Bruno  Langlet,  one could point at the theoretical difficulties connected with the aesthetic implications of object theory, and argue that Meinong's realistic approach to aesthetic  properties  may  be  grounded  in  his  theory  of  emotions,  rather\n\n2 Cf.

Meinong (1894).\n\nthan simply applied to it. Therefore, what I am going to sketch here is just one of  many possible  paths.  I  have  chosen  to  follow  it  because  it  links Meinong's  early  philosophical  reflection,  where  psychological  analysis prevails,  to  object  theory,  and  construes  his  aesthetic  views  as  a  natural development of this research itinerary. I shall now attempt to reconstruct its main stages.\n\nIn  his  1889  article  'Phantasie-Vorstellung  und  Phantasie',  Meinong defines imagination as a dispositional concept which must be determined with  respect  to  a  correlate,  namely,  phantasy-representations  ( Phantasievorstellungen ).  More specifically, imagination is 'the capability of an intuitive  production  of  representations  [ die  Fähigkeit  zu  anschaulicher Vorstellungsproduktion ],' 7 whose  peculiar  moments  are  the  production itself and its intuitability ( Anschaulichkeit ). Production of representations - which will have a major importance in the context of the Graz school, characterizing its psychological orientation - is the mental act that spontaneously produces a representation by connecting some elements within consciousness. Thus, the product is always a complexion ( Komplexion ) of elements, distinct from each other, but bound together by one or several relations. The production is only possible subsequently to the perception of  the  simple  elements,  which  are  the  ultimate  constituents  of  the  complexion,  and  which  may  never  be  produced,  but  only  reproduced  (of course, after being perceived). A complexion does not merely come down to  the  sum  total  of  its  elements,  for  an  important  role  is  played  by  the form: indeed, complexions made up of the same elements can differ because of their form (for instance, different melodies with the same set of notes). As previously in Hume-Studien II (1882), but on a less psychologistic  note,  Meinong distinguishes between real complexions, which are perceptible,  and  ideal  ones,  which  are  not. An  equivalent  distinction  is also  drawn between complexions of given ( vorfindliche )  representations and complexions of producible ( erzeugbare ) representations: imagination may only bring about the former as a result of a perceptive act - in which case it would be more appropriate to speak of a reproduction -, whereas the latter are the result of production of representations, which requires -\n\n7 Meinong (1889), GA I, p. 198.\n\nas I said above - nothing more than a prior perception of their basic constituents. In the former case, the subject has a passive role; in the latter he is  active,  as  for  example  when  he  detects  the  similarity  of  two  objects, which is not perceptible - unlike the objects themselves. 8\n\nThe construction of a theory of relations pervades Meinong's writings during a whole decade (1889-1899). Besides 'Phantasie-Vorstellung und Phantasie', another fundamental stage of this process is 'Zur Psychologie der  Komplexionen  und  Relationen'  (1891),  an  essay-review  discussing Ehrelfels'  article  'Ueber  'Gestaltqualitäten''  (1890).  Within  the  Graz school, this article played a major role in shaping both the theory of production of representations and the theory of higher-order objects. Ehrenfels asks himself whether, when apprehending a melody or a spatial figure ( Raumgestalt ), a given consciousness represents to itself something more than  the  individual  tones  or  spatial  determinations. 9 By  the  concept  of Gestalt quality, he answers that question in the affirmative. Gestalt qualities  are  'positive  contents  of  representation  [ positive  Vorstellungsinhalte ],' i.e. units made up of separable elements which do not reduce to the sum total of these elements, just as a melody does not reduce to the mere union of the tones which constitute it. The sets of representations, whose existence is necessary for instantiating the Gestalt qualities, are the grounding  of  such  qualities. 10 The  representational  content  of  the  latter depends on their grounding, yet it is distinct and distinguishable from it. 11\n\nIn 'Zur Psychologie der Komplexionen und Relationen', Meinong interprets  Ehrenfels'  Gestalt  qualities  as  founded  contents  ( fundierte  Inhalte );  their  representations  are  based  on  foundations  ( Grundlagen )  or founding contents ( fundierende Inhalte ) and are non-independent with respect to these (as in the case of a melody and its single tones, or the relation of similarity and its foundations). Conversely, non-founded (or perceptive)  representations  are  independent. 12 These  concepts  are  resumed and further developed in the 'Beiträge zur Theorie der psychischen Ana-\n\n8 Cf.

A relation is part  of  a  complexion,  for  'a  complexion  is  a  relation  together  with  its members.' 15 Yet, as I said above, it is not the sum of the former with the latter: it is something more. Relations and complexions are not necessarily ideal: elaborating on a suggestion he had put forward in Hume-Studien II , Meinong claims that they may also be real, in which case they are not brought about by a mental activity, but have to be perceived in their temporal and spatial determinations before they can be reproduced. 16\n\nMeinong  calls  the  objects  of  higher  order  'founded  objects',  since they are the outcome of a founding process which occurs by logical necessity once the foundations (i.e. the inferiora) are given: for example, the relation of difference necessarily follows from a pair of colours, say, red and green. Now it is the founded objects, not the founded contents, that correspond  to  Ehrenfels'  Gestalt  qualities:  here,  the  distinction  between object and content 17 brings to light the distance from Meinong's previous\n\n13 Cf.

As a mental fact, the content exists and is real; conversely, the object which is repre-\n\nconception.  Each superius may  be  in  turn  an inferius for  further superiora ,  that  is,  the  series  of  levels of higher order has no upper bound; if we  go  down,  on  the  other  hand,  we  necessarily  reach  a  set  of  ultimate constituents  which  admit  of  no  further  division. This  is  the  principle  of obligatory infima . 18 Foundation is the ontological pendant of production of representations: the latter explains how the representations of superiora proceed from those of inferiora, while the former accounts for the arising of  higher-order  objects  from  lower-order  ones.  A  substantial  difference lies  in  the  fact  that  the  foundation  is  logically  necessary,  while  the  production of representations is not. Two objects A and B necessarily ground the relation of difference, which subsists even if no subject is there to capture it. Elementary representations, on the other hand, must not necessarily give rise to the representation of a given superius: they may produce representations of many different superiora, or even exist without any of these. 19 In  1899,  Meinong does not yet clearly distinguish between production  of  representations  and  foundation.  Such  distinction  is  made  explicit  for  the  first  time  in Über  Annahmen , 20 but  in  fact,  it  is  a  result achieved by Ameseder in his doctoral thesis Zur Systematik der idealen Gegenstände (1901), as Meinong himself openly acknowledges. 21\n\nAmeseder agrees in principle to the theory of objects of higher order, and  proposes  a  refinement  and  a  development  of  this  theory,  aimed  at solving some open problems which include the distinction between foundation and production of representations. It is correct - he remarks - to assert that ideal objects may not be attained by perception, yet Meinong's 1899 essay conflates two substantially different facts, which are sented  by  such  content  may  also  be  non-existent  and  non-real.

Ameseder  calls  instead  for  a sharp distinction between foundation and production. We have the former if an (ideal) relation ρ subsists between two objects A and B : this means that ρ is built on A and B , is grounded through them, and subsists necessarily.  If A and B are  perceived,  object A corresponds to content a ,  and object B to  content b .  Furthermore, a new content appears in connection with object ρ : a representation of the relation ( Relationsvorstellung ); call it r . Not only is r (obviously) not built on A and B , but even the way it relates  to a and b is  not  the  same  as  in  the  foundation.  Contents a and b , Ameseder explains, ground a relation  or  complexion,  at  any  rate  something ideal. For instance, the contents of different representations, insofar as  they  are  different,  ground  the  relation  of  difference, r ',  which  is  an ideal higher-order object on its own, distinct from the mental correlate of ρ .  This  correlate  is r :  contrary  to ρ ', r is  a  (mental)  content,  and  consequently it is real - it exists -, which means that foundation is ruled out. The way r relates to a and b is very peculiar and yet it exactly mirrors the way ρ relates to A and B . These relations may be graphically represented as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJust as a representation of difference may only be thought of as a representation of different objects, difference itself is not conceivable except through different things. Yet, no other representation may be added to the representation of the objects, except the representation of the specific difference which they exhibit with respect to each other. Therefore, although r descends  by  necessity  from a and b ,  this  necessity  is  a  psychological normativity  ( Gesetzmäßigkeit ),  rather  than  a  logical  one.  Psychological\n\nnecessity means that no relation may be represented without representing its inferiora; it does not mean that, given the latter, relation r is produced automatically and independently of the subject (as is the case with foundation). In order for r to be instantiated, some mental activity is required, which bears on the contents in the same way as the foundation bears on the objects. This activity is called 'production'. 22\n\nThe theory of higher-order objects is important in aesthetics, because both fictitious and aesthetic objects are, in Meinong's view, ideal objects of higher order. Relative to this theory, two points need to be stressed. On one hand, according to Meinong's own words, the version outlined in the 1899 essay is nothing more than a sketch. 23 Furthermore, as he acknowledges  in Über  emotionale  Präsentation (1917)  answering  to  Witasek's criticism, it is developed bearing in mind objecta alone, without considering  other  kinds  of  objects  such  as  the  objectives, 24 which  Meinong  had not yet conceived in 1899. In his later works, he almost invariably quotes his 1899 essay as the reference text for the notion of higher-order object, implicitly inviting the reader to complete the theory on his own. But this is evidence to the effect that a genuine theory of relations is not available from an object-theoretic perspective; thus, it is a weakness of the object theory. On the other hand, the 1899 essay marks the starting point of the formulation of the object theory, and therefore represents the true beginning of Meinong's object-theoretic research. This process begins to yield concrete results after 1900 and acquires a definite outline in 1904, which is  the  year  of  publication  of  the  collective  volume Untersuchungen  zur Gegenstandstheorie und Psychologie .\n\nI will only recall here the main elements of the object theory, which is also laid out in Jacquette's and Langlet's contributions. The first is Brentano's  intentionality  thesis,  which  ensures  an  autonomous  and  specific status  for  mental  phenomena  and  allows  us  to  distinguish  them  from\n\n22 Cf. Ameseder (1901), pp. 6 ff. For further details on the themes introduced so far (imagination, phantasy-representations, foundation and production of representations), cf. Raspa (2005a).\n\n23 Cf.

[(1972), pp. 93 f.].\n\nphysical ones. 25 Following the footsteps of Kazimierz Twardowski (18661938), who had linked intentionality with the distinction of act, content and object of a representation, 26 Meinong goes so far as to identify a third class of objects, i.e. ideal objects, which are neither physical nor mental. By the  term  'object',  Meinong  understands  anything  that  can  be  apprehended by mental experience or expressed by language: therefore, in his view, it is a term that does not commit him to any thesis about the being or the essence of something. Other fundamental tenets of the object theory include: the distinction between what exists - that is, endures in time -and what does not exist, but subsists or is outside of being ( außerseiend ),  and consequently, the ontological classification of objects as  existent,  subsistent  and  outside  of  being;  the  concept  of Daseinsfreiheit , which is spelt out in two fundamental principles, i.e. the principle of independence  of  so-being  from  being 27 and  the  principle  of  extra-being ( Außersein ); 28 and the psycho-gnoseological classification of objects. The latter is carried out in accordance with the mental experiences that apprehend  each  object:  thus,  objecta  ( Objekte )  correspond  to  representations, objectives ( Objektive ) to thoughts (judgments and assumptions), dignitatives ( Dignitative ) to feelings, and desideratives ( Desiderative ) to desires. Looking at the first two classes, objecta can be objects of lower or higher order,  whereas  objectives  are  always  of  higher  order.  An  objective  requires the objecta; it can be the inferius of another objective, but because of the principle of obligatory infima ,  at  the lower end of the series there are  only  objecta. 29 Unlike  the  latter,  which  may  exist  or  not,  objectives\n\n25 Cf.

The  essay  'Über Urteilsgefühle: was sie sind und was sie nicht sind' (1905) marks an important step in Meinong's aesthetic research, as it features a theory of artistic  production  consistent  with  the  new  object-theoretic  point  of  view. Having  assumed  the  principle  of  independence  of  so-being  from  being and the principle of extra-being, Meinong is naturally led to the claim that the artist does not create the object, since the latter is ideal; rather, using words and propositions or musical notes, he produces representations, and more generally, phantasy-experiences ( Phantasieerlebnisse ). As we know, phantasy-representations  -  as  well  as  other  phantasy-experiences  -  are always complex, for the simple cannot be produced, and they mean objects of varying degrees of complexity. 30 An object will then correspond to one of the possible combinations of properties in extra-being. If something had not been possible, it could never have obtained: being implies the possibility of being. Here, possibility is neither physical nor logical: it is  a  combinatorial  possibility,  which  can  also  imply  the  combination  of mutually  incompatible  properties  -  as  illustrated  by  many  examples  in literary  texts. All  this  implies  that,  from  a  subjective  point  of  view,  the artist creates , while from an objective one he discovers , and allows us to discover - in Meinong's words, he picks out from among the infinite totality of the objects outside of being 31 -  a  possible sequence of property combinations - one of the possible books of Borges' library of Babel. 32\n\n30 According to the scanty semiotic theory expounded in the first edition of Über Annahmen (1902),  pp.  16  ff.,  and  resumed  with  few  changes  in  the  second (1910 2 ), pp. 21 ff., texts are composed of words and propositions, they express experiences (representations and judgments or assumptions) and they mean objects (objecta and objectives); in the case of literary texts, the latter are mostly fictional, but not necessarily so. I have dealt with this subject in Raspa (2001); cf. also Dölling (1998) and (2005), Simons &amp; Morscher (2001).\n\n31 Cf. Meinong (1905), GA I, p. 603; (1910 2 ), GA IV, p. 274 [(1983), p. 197].\n\n32 On this topic, cf. Raspa (2006a), pp. 55 ff.\n\nAs Riccardo Martinelli  explains  in his  essay  -  where  he  introduces the contributions of Ehrenfels, Höfler and Witasek to musical aesthetics 33 - Höfler applies this theory to the composition of a musical work and asserts,  contradicting  Witasek,  that  melodies  are  not  created  but  discovered. 34 Under many respects, the point of view of extra-being is a secular equivalent  of  the  perspective  traditionally  designated  by  the  expression sub specie aeternitatis. If we follow Spinoza and place ourselves sub specie  aeternitatis ,  all  possibilities  are  there;  for  Meinong  too,  possibilities are  already  there  in  the  sense  of  the  pre-givenness  of  extra-being,  provided they are understood as the possible combinations of properties and relations among objects, i.e. all the (combinatorially) possible complexes.\n\nI have already mentioned Über Annahmen (1902, 1910 2 ). Here, Meinong  sets  forth  two  further  important  aesthetic  theses:  he  identifies  the true aesthetic  object  with  the  objective,  and  he  differentiates  aesthetic feelings from phantasy-feelings.\n\nOur attitude to the aesthetic object - Meinong writes - by no means entails the belief that it exists. As we have seen, the being of an artwork (literary or musical) is not existence: it is a being disengaged from space and time. This is why the aesthetic object may not be created - because it does not exist. Yet, what kind of objects are aesthetic objects? According to Meinong, the true aesthetic objects are the objectives, 35 which are apprehended by assumptions. It is plain that, in the case of literary works, propositions generally express assumptions, which in turn - as we know signify  objectives. 36 Moreover,  looking  at  representations,  it  is  equally evident  that  we  are  dealing  with  phantasy-representations,  which  are compound and refer  to  objects  of  higher  order,  that  is,  to  complexes; 37 and  since  any  complex  implies  an  objective,  we  may  only  apprehend  a\n\n33 In an essay published in a previous volume of Meinong Studies , Martinelli discussed musical objects of higher order in Meinong; cf. Martinelli (2006).\n\n34 Cf. Höfler (1912), p. 225.\n\n35 Cf. Meinong (1910 2 ), GA IV, pp. 318, 319 [(1983), pp. 227, 228].\n\n36 Cf.

At  the  theatre,  for  example,  we  undergo  fear  without  being alarmed, and compassion without grief; such feelings are neither true fear nor  true  compassion.  Phantasy-feelings  must  therefore  be  distinguished from aesthetic feelings, which are true. Aesthetic enjoyment is one thing; the feeling we experience at the theatre - say, compassion for the tragic destiny of Gretchen in Faust -  is  another. It is not simply a feeling of a lower degree - it is even qualitatively different from a corresponding feeling addressed to a real person. Phantasy-feelings, together with assumptions, contribute to arousing aesthetic feelings, but they are not aesthetic feelings in their own right. Something similar holds for phantasy-desires ( Phantasiebegehrungen ),  which may concern for example the characters of a novel. 39 I will return in due course to this issue, which is taken up by several representatives of the Graz school.\n\nIn Über Möglichkeit  und Wahrscheinlichkeit (1915),  Meinong  deals extensively  with  the  incompleteness  ( Unvollständigkeit )  of  objecta  and the  subfactuality  ( Untertatsächlichkeit )  of  objectives;  subsequently,  in Über emotionale Präsentation (1917), he puts forward the notion of shadowiness ( Schattenhaftigkeit ) of phantasy-experiences. 40 In my view, these three  concepts  -  which  express  graduality,  indeterminateness,  and  variability  -  may  be  very  fruitfully  applied  to  the  analysis  of  literary  texts. Every fictional object is an incomplete non-existing object of higher order,  and  every  meaning  of  a  literary  text  expresses  an  objective,  whose\n\n38 Cf.

Meinong  (1917), GA III,  pp.  332  ff.

Likewise, phantasy-experiences possess different degrees of shadowiness, according to their proximity to the corresponding genuine experiences ( Ernsterlebnisse ),  which constitute their upper bound. The property which may not be increased is the limit at infinity of the property admitting of changes in degree. 41\n\nÜber emotionale Präsentation (1917) marks the last significant stage of Meinong's reflections on aesthetics. In this writing, as we will see, he sharpens his theses on the aesthetic object, replying to Witasek's criticism and reasserting the reasons why aesthetic objects are objects of higher order.\n\n## 3. Witasek's psychological aesthetics\n\nEven though he contradicts his mentor and friend on several points, Witasek sets forth an aesthetic theory deeply rooted in Meinong's philosophy, which draws the attention of the scholars in the early twentieth century. As Christian Allesch skilfully argues in his contribution to this volume, Witasek, together with Theodor Lipps (1851-1914) and Johannes Volkelt (1848-1930), was a leading figure in the milieu of aesthetic research in the beginning of the century, especially among the followers of that psychological current which took inspiration from Gustav Theodor Fechner (1801-1887)  and  his  attempt  to  found  aesthetics  on  an  empirical  basis. Witasek had several controversies with Lipps, not only over the notion of empathy - which he regarded as a form of representation, whereas Lipps deemed it a real experience - but also because of his assumptions of Meinongian concepts. 42\n\n41 For  further  details  on  these  three  concepts  and  their  application  to  literary  as well  as  historical  texts,  cf.  Raspa  (2001),  pp.  66  ff.,  (2005a),  pp.  121  ff.,  and (2005b).\n\n42 The standard reference on psychological aesthetics is Allesch (1987); see esp. pp. 303 ff.\n\nA  student  in  Graz  from  the  winter  semester  of  1892/93  to  March 1895, Witasek earned his doctoral degree under the supervision of Meinong and Hugo Spitzer (1854-1936),  with  a  dissertation  entitled Untersuchungen  zur  Complexions-Theorie .  Apparently,  he  and  Meinong  had first made acquaintance playing music together, and subsequently became close friends. He qualified in January 1899, with the essay Über die Natur der  geometrisch-optischen  Täuschungen .  In  order  to  earn  his  living,  he worked  as  a  librarian  in  the  Imperial  and  Royal  University  Library  in Graz,  but  he  also  did  research  with  Meinong  following  the  foundation (1894) of the Psychology Laboratory, which he eventually directed for a few months before he died in 1915. 43 Besides psychology, Witasek's other research  area  was  aesthetics. Along  with  some  articles  and  reviews,  the main writings he devoted to this field are the Grundzüge der allgemeinen Ästhetik (1904)  and  the  essay  'Über  ästhetische  Objektivität'  (1915), published posthumously. In addition to these, as far  as  feelings  and  desires are concerned, we can mention section two of the second part of the Grundlinien der Psychologie (1908),  entitled  'Psychologie  des  Gemütslebens'. 44\n\nAs Ameseder pointed out, Witasek must be credited with the application of the Meinongian concept of assumption to some major problems in aesthetics, and more importantly still, with the introduction of the object theory into aesthetic research - as can be seen especially in the discussion of aesthetic properties - although his aesthetics remains for the most part a  psychological  one. 45 Some  clarifications  are  in  order  on  the  second point. Witasek does assume several of Meinong's ontological theses, but dissents from him on some fundamental issues concerning aesthetic objects, namely, the role of objectives and - consequently - that of assumptions.  Furthermore,  it  should  be  stressed  that  his  conceptual  framework does not coincide with the object theory as we know it: the collective volume Untersuchungen  zur  Gegenstandstheorie  und  Psychologie ,  which contains Meinong's celebrated essay 'Über Gegenstandstheorie', is pub-\n\n43 The most detailed reconstruction of Witasek's biography is provided by Zemlji č (1993), pp. 3 ff., and (1994).\n\n44 Cf. Witasek (1908), pp. 315-362.\n\n45 Cf. Ameseder (1916), pp. 75 f.\n\nlished  in  November  1904;  the  same  volume  includes,  among  others,  a contribution  by  Saxinger 46 that  criticizes  Witasek's  claims  on  phantasyfeelings, and defends instead the views laid out by Meinong in the first edition  of Über Annahmen .  In Grundzüge der allgemeinen Ästhetik ,  the sources for Meinong's thought are the following texts: 'Zur Psychologie der  Komplexionen  und  Relationen'  (1891), Psychologisch-ethische  Untersuchungen  zur  Werttheorie (1894),  'Über  Gegenstände  höherer  Ordnung und deren Verhältnis zur inneren Wahrnehmung' (1899), and Über Annahmen (1902). Even granting that object-theoretic views are conveyed by these writings, the object theory is not yet explicitly formulated; at any rate, Witasek never mentions Daseinsfreiheit , extra-being, or the principle of independence.\n\nThe Grundzüge reject at once perspectivism - 'because, as long as an object  is  designated  unambiguously,  there  is  but one truth  about  it' 47 -and the view that aesthetics is a normative science. 48 Since Witasek takes it to be self-evident that psychological phenomena - both intellectual and emotional - are intentional, the determination of its own object will be no less of a duty for aesthetics than for any other science. Yet the material of aesthetics  is  very  diverse,  including  on  one  side  animate  and  inanimate natural objects, and on the other the products of man, coming from individuals and communities alike, human mentalities and ways of thinking, social  institutions,  usages  and  customs,  culture,  education,  and  much more; therefore, the domain of aesthetics cannot be identified with art, for it extends far beyond. This miscellaneous material can be subdivided into three  classes:  ( i )  things  (artworks,  objects  of  nature),  ( ii )  processes,  actions  or  states  of  affairs  directed  at  these  objects  (artistic  creation,  aesthetic enjoyment), (iii) dispositions and attitudes required for performing these actions. Despite their variety, the items of the first group share a peculiarity which explains why the facts in the second group are aimed at them: they possess certain properties, which are neither physical nor men-\n\n46 Cf. Saxinger (1904).\n\n47 Witasek (1904), p. 5.\n\n48 A  brief  presentation  of  the  aesthetics  of  the Grundzüge is  offered  in  Smith (1996) and Schuhmann (2001); for a general outlook on Witasek's writings on aesthetics, cf. Zemlji č (1993), pp. 81 ff.\n\ntal. These are the aesthetic properties, the most characteristic of which is beauty;  other  such  properties  include  ugliness,  grace,  the  sublime,  the tragic or comic, and so on. 49\n\nNow,  as  Meinong  argued,  a  property  which  is  neither  physical  nor mental  must  be  ideal.  If  we  call  perceptible  objects  'real'  and  nonperceptible  ones  'ideal',  then  a  property  like  beauty  is  not  real:  it  is  an ideal property of the object it pertains to. 50 The beauty of a painting is not perceptible in the same way as the picture or the masses of colour; when we listen  to  a  melody  or  a  poem,  we  hear  sounds  or  words,  but  beauty does  not  come  down  to  the  individual  sounds  or  words,  nor  is  it  juxtaposed to them as a separate entity.\n\nIn  order  to  characterize  aesthetic  properties,  Witasek  integrates  the Meinongian dichotomy of real and ideal objects with a further distinction between objective ( gegenständliche ) properties and extra-objective ( außergegenständliche )  properties. 51 Since the former have to be 'represented or thought together [ mitvorgestellt, mitgedacht ] with the representation of an object,' 52 beauty is not even an objective property, that is, a quality  that  contributes  to  shaping  the  identity  of  an  object.  Colour,  for example, is an objective property of an ornament, but similarity with another  ornament  is  not;  likewise,  beauty  is  an  extra-objective  property. Moreover,  aesthetic  properties  are  relational,  because  they  connect  the aesthetic object (belonging to the first group) to the mental attitude of a human subject (which is part of the second group). In fact, the relation is twofold: (1) a causal one, whereby an aesthetic object (a painting, statue, or melody) induces an aesthetic attitude in the subject, and (2) a final one, for the aesthetic feeling is in turn addressed to the aesthetic object. Beauty is  not  the  relation  (causal  or  final)  between  the  aesthetic  object  and  the subject's mental attitude, nor is it a member of such relation; rather, it is\n\n49 Cf. Witasek (1904), pp. 3, 9 ff.\n\n50 Cf. Witasek (1904), p. 14.\n\n51 Here,  and  likewise  in  some  passages  that  follow,  the  adjectives  'objective' ( gegenständlich ) and 'extra-objective' ( außergegenständlich ) are used in a technical sense, meaning - respectively - anything that does, or does not, enter into the description of an object.\n\n52 Witasek (1904), p. 15.\n\nthe premise, resting within the object, without which the relation would not stand.\n\nAn  aesthetic  property  of  an  object  is  the  fact  that  it  may  entertain both a causal and a final relation with a subject's aesthetic attitude . 53\n\nHere, Witasek is implicitly presupposing the theory of relations and complexes outlined by Meinong in the essay on higher-order objects.\n\nBesides, he accepts the Meinongian classification of mental phenomena:  representations  and  thoughts  have  meanings,  i.e.  object  correlates, which  are,  respectively,  things  and  facts;  or  else,  following  Meinong's semiotic theory, objecta and objectives. Things are apprehended by representations, facts by judgments or assumptions. Beauty and other aesthetic properties  may  only  be  conceived  within  a  judgment  or  an  assumption; hence, they are objects of thought, or objectives. There is a fundamental difference between the following phenomena:\n\n1.  Representing  an  object  (without  considering  its  obvious  aesthetic properties).\n2. Enjoying an object aesthetically.\n3. Representing an object as beautiful.\n\nThe first case corresponds to pure representation. The second is the aesthetic  attitude,  which  involves  a  representation  and  an  aesthetic feeling. The third case features a representation accompanied by the judgment (or assumption) that the object is beautiful. 54\n\nWitasek summarizes and clarifies his point of view through the distinction between immanent and transcendent object, which he deems particularly significant. I quote his own words, as they provide a useful introduction to the ideas he will express in 'Über ästhetische Objektivität' (1915):\n\nThe fact that the beauty of an object is only determined according to that part of its features that is mirrored in the representation, means that aesthetic properties depend on the nature of the immanent object.\n\n53 Witasek (1904), p. 22.\n\n54 Witasek (1904), p. 24.\n\nAs a rule - that is, setting aside the boundary case of the simple such object is a complex, made up of real components and ideal components constructed on them.\n\nAesthetic properties are not identical with any of the real components,  nor  with  any  of  the  ideal  ones. They  are  founded  instead,  by means of the corresponding objective, upon relations that connect the aesthetic object with something external to it, that is to say, with the subject's aesthetic attitude.\n\nAs one of these relations  we  took  into  consideration,  first  of  all, the causal relationship, which leads from the transcendent object, via the representation (the cause), to the aesthetic feeling (the effect).\n\nSecondly, we came to know the final relation, by virtue of which the  aesthetic  feeling  is  addressed  in  the  first  place  to  the  immanent object,  but  also  to  the  transcendent  one  whenever  it  is  given  or thought. 55\n\nLet us now turn to aesthetic objects. Given all that has been said, we can immediately understand Witasek's assertion that 'an object becomes an aesthetic object , if it is a bearer of aesthetic properties.' 56 It is not an aesthetic object insofar as it possesses some specific objective properties, but rather, insofar as it stands, or can stand, in a given relation with a subject. This does not entail that objective determinations, real or ideal, are indifferent in order for an object - say - to be beautiful: 'being beautiful means standing in a certain relation  to  a  subject,' 57 and  such  a  relation depends on the properties of the object.\n\nThe  objective  nature  [ Die  gegenständliche  Beschaffenheit ]  is  not identical with beauty, but it constitutes its presupposition or foundation; it has to fulfil a certain set of conditions and laws, in order that the object may be held beautiful. 58\n\nWhat is the relation between the subjective factor and the objective one, i.e. between the disposition of the subject and the qualities of the ob-\n\n55 Witasek (1904), p. 26.\n\n56 Witasek (1904), p. 27.\n\n57 Witasek (1904), p. 28.\n\n58 Witasek (1904), p. 29.\n\nject? There has to be something, in the subject's attitude, that leads him to judge a given object as beautiful or ugly. That 'something', says Witasek, is the feeling of pleasure or displeasure: 59 an object is deemed beautiful or ugly if it is capable of arousing pleasure or displeasure in a subject. 60 The question then becomes whether such a feeling is due to the qualities of the object or to the attitude of the subject. In the former hypothesis, we could distinguish  aesthetic  objects  from  non-aesthetic  ones;  conversely,  if  the subject decides at his discretion on the beauty of an object, then no classification is possible, and the value of objective properties is considerably diminished. If that were the case, one question would remain unanswered: to what extent are the changes in mental attitude determined by the properties of the object?\n\nAfter a painstaking analysis of the subject's aesthetic condition ( der ästhetische Zustand des Subjektes ), Witasek openly dismisses the second option. On the one hand, he is firmly convinced that 'all aesthetic facts are ultimately rooted in the subject's aesthetic attitude.' 61 Yet it is not by appealing to this attitude that we can explain what leads us to call an object beautiful or ugly. To be sure, relativism is supported by the obvious evidence that the same object may induce different aesthetic reactions in different individuals, not to mention the case of different cultures or historical ages; this - Witasek remarks - may happen as well to a single individual, who can judge the same object beautiful or ugly in different circumstances. Pleasure and displeasure towards an object undergo a great deal of fluctuations, just as happens with other kinds of mental dispositions. 62 The subjective element is not disavowed, for 'the intensity of the feeling of pleasure is the index [ Gradmesser ]  of  beauty;' 63 nonetheless, the circular process of the aesthetic experience is set off by the object: it\n\n59 Cf. Witasek (1904), p. 31.\n\n60 Cf. Witasek (1904), p. 353.\n\n61 Witasek (1904), p. 331.\n\n62 Cf. Witasek (1904), pp. 351, 353.\n\n63 Witasek (1904), p. 354.\n\nis the object that elicits the subject's aesthetic feelings, which are in turn directed towards it. 64\n\nWitasek calls 'elementary aesthetic objects' those objects whose 'aesthetic properties do not turn out to be the sum total of the aesthetic properties of the components (elements) of the object, and therefore bear only on the object as a whole, and vanish when it is broken down.' 65 He initially identifies five classes of aesthetic objects: (1) objects of pure sensation  ( einfache Empfindungsgegenstände ),  (2)  shapes  ( Gestalten ),  (3)  objects complying with a norm ( normgemäße Gegenstände ), (4) expressive and  atmospheric  objects  ( ausdrucks-  und  stimmungsvolle  Gegenstände ), and (5) objectives. Subsequently, after a careful critical examination, he writes off the objectives and reduces the number to four. 66\n\nThe notion of Gestalt closely connects Witasek to Meinong, Ehrenfels and the other representatives of the Graz school, who adopt the same notion. 67 According to Witasek, the Gestalt is not given: it is produced by the subject. 68 He explicitly refers to the theory of production of representations, which he largely contributed to develop. 69 The representation of a melody  -  he  maintains,  following  Ehrenfels  and  Meinong 70 -  contains something more than the representations of the individual tones: this extra content depends on the tones, for it is built on them and could never be represented  without  them,  yet,  at  the  same  time,  it  is  precisely  what makes them a melody.\n\nThe  representation  of  this  plus  [ Plus ]  is  not  achieved  within  us through sensations, as is the case with tones. It is rather a certain reaction  to  sensations,  coming  from  the  inside:  representations  occur-\n\n64 Cf. Schuhmann (2001), p. 526. For an inquiry into this issue, cf. Reicher (2006), pp. 314 ff.\n\n65 Witasek (1904), p. 35.\n\n66 Cf. Witasek (1904), pp. 179 f.\n\n67 For the significance of the concept of 'Gestalt structure' in Witasek, cf. Smith (1994), pp. 136 ff.\n\n68 Cf. Witasek (1904), p. 16.\n\n69 Cf. Stock (1995), pp. 462 ff.\n\n70 Witasek  refers  to  three  texts,  which  have  been  briefly  examined  above: Ehrenfels (1890), Meinong (1891) and (1899).\n\nring  within  consciousness  stimulate  it  to produce a  new  representation. The  content  and  the  object  of  this  produced  representation  are founded and built on the content and the object of the producing representation,  and  depend  on  it.  Therefore,  they  are  called  ' founded content ' and ' founded object '. 71\n\nOn the other hand, with his  interpretation  of  the  objective, Witasek stands clearly  against  Meinong. As he acknowledges in the appendix to the  Italian  edition  of  the Grundzüge ,  this  is  where  his  views  have  met with a particularly fierce opposition, not only by Meinong. 72\n\nWitasek recognizes the value of objectives in aesthetics, but does not regard  them  as  aesthetic  objects.  Objectives  -  as  Meinong  remarked  have a key role in literature, since novels, plays and poems are made up of propositions, and they may not be understood and enjoyed unless we grasp their meaning, i.e. the objectives. Also, there exist narrative paintings,  which  attain  their  full  aesthetic  effect  not  just  through  the  things they represent, but also because of what they mean. In other words, they require an interpretation: along with the narrative act, an act of judgment is  needed  to  comprehend  them,  and  the  object  of  that  judgment  is  precisely an objective. Therefore, the content of these paintings consists both of objectives and of objects of representation. 73 The latter play certainly an important role, for no objective, as a higher-order object, can subsist without the objecta. Yet this role is secondary compared to that of the objectives: in order to understand a literary text, it suffices to have a sketchy image of the things it describes - in fact, every reader pictures them in a different  way  -,  whereas  it  is  fundamental  to  grasp  the  overall  plot  and the  individual  events  and  situations,  hence  the  connections  between  the characters and the objects within the story. 'But these are objectives, not objects of representation.' 74 Despite all this, says Witasek, 'objectives are\n\n71 Witasek (1904), p. 41.\n\n72 Cf. Witasek (1912), p. 323.\n\n73 Cf. Witasek (1904), pp. 53 ff.\n\n74 Witasek (1904), p. 57.\n\nnot the genuine aesthetic objects, as appears at first sight; they are simply mediators for such objects.' 75\n\nGiven that the aesthetic object is what our feeling of pleasure or displeasure is directed to, it is plain that it may not coincide with the objective, for the latter is neither ugly nor beautiful, and therefore that no aesthetic feeling may be addressed to it. To be sure, alongside language and style, the beauty of a literary work is due to its content, hence to the objectives that make it up: someone who does not comprehend the content of a work may not claim to have enjoyed it. Literature is aesthetically effective primarily because of its content. Still, the objective is not beautiful by itself; it is only a mediator of beauty .\n\nAny objective - Witasek states - contains objecta and is aimed at describing facts and situations. If what is described has aesthetic properties, then  so  does  the  objective,  but  only  indirectly:  an  objective  is  aesthetically  active  depending  on  which  words  and  representations  are  used  to convey  it  to  the  subject,  and  thus,  ultimately,  depending  on  how  it  is thought. What is important is the choice of the phrases, their position, the outward expression in general. Witasek argues for his thesis by pointing at the example of a poem: if we put it into prose, we will obtain - setting aside any formal additions - two expressions which mean the same objective, except that the prose version no longer induces any aesthetic pleasure. It is not that the objective is unimportant: it may have an ethical importance,  or  an  epistemic  one;  it  may  even  have  an  aesthetic  value,  but not directly - unlike colours or harmony in the case of a picture or a piece of music. The objective alone is not sufficient: the form has to go with it. In the case of narrative paintings, the inspiration may well be an objective, but the primary aesthetic object is what is shown on the canvas. The thought  of  the  objective  enriches  the  matter  of  the  representation,  and consequently the material which gives rise to our aesthetic feelings, but it is not the direct object of our aesthetic attitude. 76\n\nSimilarly, objectives are just mediators with respect to feelings. In the case  of  narrative  arts,  the  latter  are  essentially  empathy-feelings  ( Ein-\n\n75 Witasek (1904), pp. 167 f.\n\n76 Cf. Witasek (1904), pp. 170 ff.\n\nfühlungsgefühle )  and  sympathy-feelings  ( Anteilsgefühle ); 77 in  order  to have a better hold on this point, let us dwell on Witasek's conception of aesthetic feelings and phantasy-feelings.\n\nFeelings  are  mental  complexes,  consisting  of  several  elementary facts, which always include representing, sometimes judging, but mainly the act of feeling. The emotional factor determines the fundamental character of a feeling; yet, from this viewpoint, the only possible qualitative variations  concern  the  opposition  of  pleasure  and  displeasure  and  their intensity. Any further difference among feelings must be ascribed to the intellectual sphere, rather than to the emotional one. Now, intellectual life consists of representing (perceptual, mnemonic and phantasyrepresentations)  and  thinking  (judgments  and  assumptions);  given  that both may act as presuppositions for a feeling, we may draw a fundamental distinction between representation-feelings ( Vorstellungsgefühle ) and thought-feelings  ( Denkgefühle ).  One  kind  of  thought-feelings  are  valuefeelings ( Wertgefühle ), that is to say, those feelings where the pleasure or displeasure is directed to the existence or non-existence of the object of value; since existence and non-existence are objectives, and not objects of representation,  it  follows  that  representation  alone  does  not  suffice  as  a presupposition for value-feelings. What is needed, instead, is a judgment; if  the  presupposition  were  an  assumption,  we  would  not  have  genuine feelings  ( Ernstgefühle ),  which  are  real,  but  phantasy-feelings  ( Phantasiegefühle ). Aesthetic feelings, on the other hand, are completely different, for their presuppositions are representations. This does not amount to saying that all judgment-feelings are value-feelings, nor that all representation-feelings are aesthetic feelings: what we have here, rather, are two specific subsets of two general classes. 78 I will not go into any further de-\n\n77 Empathy-feelings are feelings through which a person who reads, for instance, a novel, feels with the characters what they feel (joy, pain, torment, confidence, etc.); in this case, the subject reproduces in himself the psychical life of the object  (the  characters  of  a  story).  Sympathy-feelings  are  the  liking,  the  compassion, etc. that the reader feels for the  characters of a story, thus reacting emotionally to the object. Cf. Witasek (1904), pp. 148 f.; cf. also Smith (1996), pp. 220 ff.\n\n78\n\nCf. Witasek (1904), pp. 67 ff.\n\ntail: for our purposes, all that is needed is to hold on to this clear-cut distinction between value-feelings and aesthetic feelings.\n\nFollowing  Meinong, 79 Witasek  divides  all  mental  phenomena  into real  (or  genuine)  phenomena  and  phantasy-phenomena:  thus,  perceptual representations correspond to phantasy-representations, judgments to assumptions, genuine feelings to phantasy-feelings, and genuine desires to phantasy-desires. Phantasy-experiences diverge from real ones not only in intensity, but also in quality: this holds true even when the perceptual representation  and  the  imaginary  one,  or  a  judgment  and  an  assumption, share the same object. However, if we turn to emotional experiences, the distinction between the real and the imaginary seems no longer valid, because the emotional factor of phantasy-feelings induced by assumptions is identical with that of genuine feelings: leaving aside the presuppositions and other incidental facts, the two classes of feelings are not different in quality. Phantasy-pleasure is just as much of a pleasure as the real one; it is  only  the  intensity  that  changes. A sound and coherent complex of assumptions (that is, a credible, well-structured story) may provoke feelings whose  degree  of  intensity  is  even  comparable  to  that  of  judgmentfeelings.  Nevertheless  -  Witasek  agrees  with  Meinong  on  this  point  -, phantasy-feelings  are  fundamentally  different  from  genuine  ones,  because,  strictly  speaking,  they  bring  neither  joy  nor  affliction;  otherwise, nobody would go to the theatre to see a tragedy.\n\nWitasek's  thesis  may  then  be  summarized  as  follows:  phantasyfeelings  are  identical  to  real  feelings  as  regards  the  emotional  involvement, but depart from them in the presuppositions. Phantasy-feelings depend on assumptions, genuine ones on judgments; while we succumb to the latter, we can dominate the former - barring exceptional cases - especially  by  reminding  ourselves  that  what  we  are  watching  -  say,  at  the theatre  -  is  mere  fiction.  The  distinction  between  phantasy-feelings  and real feelings may therefore be preserved, and should even be extended to desires, yet - and this is where Witasek parts company with Meinong - it\n\n79 Cf. Meinong (1902), pp. 233 ff.; cf. also Meinong (1906a), GA V, pp. 428 f. fn. 2, 443 ff.; (1910 2 ), GA IV, pp. 309 ff., 379 f. [(1983), pp. 221 ff., 270 f.].\n\nis  limited  to  the  intellectual  presuppositions,  and  does  not  involve  the emotional factor. 80\n\nLet us return to the relationship between feelings and objectives, as can  be  seen  especially  in  literary  enjoyment  ( literarischer  Genuß ).  The true  immediate  objects  of  literary  enjoyment  are  empathy-feelings  and sympathy-feelings: when represented intuitively, these provide the premises  for  aesthetic  pleasure.  The  objectives  whose  thought  elicits  those feelings are simply mediators. 81 Were it not so - that is, if the feeling of aesthetic pleasure were addressed immediately to the objectives -, judgments and assumptions would be the presuppositions of that feeling; but they only play such a role with respect to value-feelings (like loving, appreciating, honouring) and feelings of knowledge (doubting, understanding).  Supposing  value-feelings  and  aesthetic  feelings  had  the  same  presuppositions, we could no longer tell them apart. The difference between them cannot lie in the fact that the former are grounded in the real world and the latter  in  imagination,  because  that  would  amount  to  saying  that the  presuppositions  of  value-feelings  are  judgments,  and  those  of  aesthetic feelings are assumptions. But we have seen that feelings stemming from  assumptions  are  imaginary,  while  aesthetic  feelings  are  real.  Besides,  assumptions  may  on  occasion  be  presuppositions  for  (phantasy-) feelings of value - I feel that I care about my father not only if I think of his existence, but also if I think that I will lose him -, and conversely, aesthetic enjoyment may be induced by judgments. Aesthetic effectiveness is therefore independent of whether objectives are brought to the subject by judgments or by assumptions.\n\nThe aesthetic attitude is not directed to objectives at all, but primarily to the objects of representation that they communicate [ vermitteln ] to the subject. 82\n\nI shall now examine how Meinong replies to Witasek. The reason for doing this is not to set up an irreducible opposition between the two au-\n\n80 Cf. Witasek (1904), pp. 110 ff.\n\n81 Cf. Witasek (1904), pp. 174 f.\n\n82 Witasek (1904), p. 179.\n\nthors, for this would be misleading, but to bring out the dialectical nature of the research - in the case in point, of the aesthetic research - within the Graz school.\n\nWitasek's thesis is diametrically opposed to Meinong's, according to which the true aesthetic objects, especially in literature, are the objectives, which are apprehended by assumptions. First of all, it should be stressed that, in Meinong's view, objectives are implied in the complex objects of representations. Moreover, Meinong affirms that the aesthetic significance of  poetry  is  dependent  on  the  determinations  of  the  real  material:  this means that, after transforming a poem into prose, we no longer have the same objective. 83 But the main point concerns Witasek's thesis that feelings having objectives as their object can only be value-feelings, and not aesthetic feelings. Now, according to Meinong, value-feelings are always directed to being, in the first place to existence, while aesthetic feelings always bear on so-being. Against Witasek, he maintains that the essence of value-feelings does not depend on judgments and assumptions, but always on the nature of the objective. If a feeling is essentially directed to the being, it is a value-feeling, if it is essentially directed to the so-being, it is an aesthetic feeling. Certainly, there are aesthetic feelings that are directed to objecta such as a colour or a form, and not to objectives, but an objective of so-being is implicit in qualitative determinations. It follows that  every  aesthetic  feeling  is  directed  to  objectives,  if  not  explicitly,  at least implicitly. 84\n\nAs for phantasy-feelings, Meinong denies that they are real feelings. According to him, they differ from real feelings not only for their presuppositions, but also because of the emotional factor. As evidence for this claim, he mentions the fact that the compassion for Gretchen's tragic destiny is both of a lower degree and qualitatively different from the compassion for a living unfortunate girl. Moreover, phantasy-feelings are not assumption-feelings ( Annahmegefühle ), for they often do not imply any assumption: that is the case, for instance, when we recall someone's death;\n\n83 Cf. Meinong (1910 2 ), GA IV ,  pp.  318  f.  [(1983),  pp.  227  f.];  but  cf.  also  Meinong (1910 2 ), GA IV ,  p. 56 [(1983), p. 46]; (1915), GA VI, pp. 27 f. and fn. 3, where he maintains that the same objective can be expressed in different forms.\n\n84 Cf. Meinong (1910 2 ), GA IV, pp. 319 f. [(1983), pp. 228 f.].\n\ntherefore,  in  comparison  with  phantasy-feelings,  the  domain  of  assumption-feelings is much more circumscribed. 85\n\nTwo students of Meinong's, and colleagues of Witasek's - Saxinger and  Schwarz  -,  take  sides  with  the  former  and  against  the  latter. 86 The whole debate is reconstructed in Íngrid Vendrell Ferran's contribution to this volume, which sheds light on two further points: first, it shows that the controversy over whether phantasy-feelings are real or fictitious had developed even outside the Graz school - with Karl Groos (1861-1946) and Lipps maintaining that feelings addressed to fictional objects are true, and Konrad Lange (1855-1921), Moritz Geiger (1880-1937) and Oswald Külpe  (1862-1915)  holding  that  they  are  different  from  real  feelings  -; secondly, it brings out some strong analogies (despite the different context) between this controversy and the current analytic debate on so-called quasi-feelings.\n\nIn  my  view,  it  is  difficult  to  draw  a  clear  line  between  phantasyfeelings  (or  quasi-feelings)  and  genuine  feelings.  The  reason  is  that  the two  groups  diverge  not  only  over  whether  our  feeling  is  addressed  to something real or fictitious, nor even, as Schwarz believes, over the intensity and temporal evolution of the feelings, whereby the real ones develop over  a  certain  time,  while  phantasy-feelings  rise  to  consciousness  in  a sudden way, and disappear just as abruptly. 87 What seems decisive to me is the emotional involvement induced by the narration. Years ago, the fact that the first Gulf War was broadcast on television led Jean Baudrillard to declare  that,  to  many  people,  that  war  had  not  truly  occurred,  but  had been staged like a film - just a piece of fiction. If so, what of the feelings experienced while the American guns were bombarding Baghdad? Were they genuine, or were they phantasy-feelings? A headline in the Monday evening news, sandwiched between a report on a new health scandal and another on recent fashion shows, stating that over fifty people have been killed in car accidents in Italy over the past weekend, would be unlikely to stir a strong reaction in the viewers; not as strong, at any rate, as would\n\n85 Cf. Meinong (1910 2 ), GA IV, pp. 316 f. [(1983), p. 226].\n\n86 Cf. Saxinger (1904), (1906) and (1908); Schwarz (1905/1906) and his doctoral thesis (1903).\n\n87 Cf. Schwarz (1905/1906), pp. 486 f., 95 ff., 101 f.\n\nthe detailed and touching account of a single accident. And, as long as the report struck the right notes, even if the accident were purely fictitious the feelings experienced while listening to the report would be more intense than those felt during the news headlines. Otherwise, what sense could we make of the panic aroused by Orson Welles' radio broadcast of October 30 th ,  1938,  where  he  announced  a  Martian  invasion  of  the  Earth,  even though he was just interpreting an adaptation of a science-fiction novel?\n\nIn 1915, in 'Über ästhetische Objektivität', Witasek amends his point of  view  over  the  aesthetic  experience,  object  and  judgment. 88 The  aesthetic  judgment,  'This  (object)  is  beautiful  (not  beautiful,  ugly,  etc.),' does not regard a relationship of the object with the subject, but a property of the object, that is entirely in it. 89 The aesthetic object consists in the unity of the substratum with its aesthetic properties. In a break from the Grundzüge ,  the  bearer  of  these  properties  is  no  longer  the  (existing) transcendent  object,  but  rather  the  (pseudo-existing)  immanent  object. Likewise, aesthetic properties are an objective component of this immanent object. Witasek explicitly excludes that the bearer be an existing or subsisting object, since he believes that the evidence of certainty ( Evidenz der Gewißheit ) concerning the aesthetic judgment holds for the immanent object alone. 90 The  essential  features  of  the  aesthetic  object  are  its  nonindependence ( Unselbständigkeit ) with respect to the substratum (i.e. the fact that the being of the aesthetic object is grounded on the being of one or more other objects), and its dependence ( Abhängigkeit ) on the modifications of the substratum. Changing some notes of a melody, for instance, may cause it to be less beautiful or even ugly. 91 Such dependence is onesided.\n\nA brief remark will suffice to bring out a clear analogy between aesthetic  properties  and  higher-order  objects,  for  example,  between  beauty and similarity. Like beauty, similarity is based on inferiora: it may not be instantiated  without  similar  objects;  moreover,  whether  two  objects  are\n\n88 This about-turn has been pointed out and discussed by Zemlji č (1993), pp. 89 f., and Reicher (2006), pp. 317 ff.\n\n89 Cf.

Briefly, nothing seems to stand against the thesis that aesthetic properties are ideal objects of higher order. 92 Yet Witasek does not take this route.\n\nUnlike the relation of similarity, which stands between the two members (say A and B ) and forms a complex together with them, beauty - says Witasek - stands on the complex A-B : if we take away the relation, both A and B stand  on  their  own;  conversely,  taking  away  beauty,  the  whole complex  is  left  untouched.  Moreover,  this  means  that  beauty  does  not need a plurality of inferiora, as is the case with higher-order objects, but a unity, which can be either complex or simple; for higher-order objects, on the other hand, resting on a unity is a boundary case (that of identity). 93 For these reasons, and others which I shall not mention, beauty - as well as other aesthetic properties - may not be regarded as an ideal object of higher order 94 . But then, since it is neither something real beside the object,  nor  an  ideal  higher-order  object, beauty  neither  exists  nor  subsists. As a consequence, there must be a new class of objects, not yet accounted for  by  the  object  theory,  which  nevertheless  subsist  objectively  in  the same way as ideal higher-order objects; or else, there must be a third kind of being, which Witasek does not identify in extra-being, but in immanent being. 95\n\nMeinong replies by accepting the first part of Witasek's discourse, i.e. the  thesis  that  the  aesthetic  object  is  non-independent  in  terms  of  being and dependent in terms of so-being; at the same time, he insists that aesthetic objects are objects of higher order, more specifically, they are complexes and bearers of beauty. 96 What is at issue is the uniqueness ( Einsheit ) of the substratum, which aesthetic properties allegedly require. Meinong believes that Witasek is mistaken when he regards higher-order objects exclusively from the standpoint of the objecta, leaving out the objectives. That was the standpoint of the essay on higher-order objects (1899),\n\n92 Cf. Witasek (1915), pp. 112 ff.\n\n93 Cf. Meinong (1899), GA II, p. 394 [(1978), p. 149].\n\n94 Cf. Witasek (1915), pp. 180 ff.\n\n95 Cf. Witasek (1915), pp. 191 f., 198.\n\n96 Cf. Meinong (1917), GA III, pp. 387 ff. [(1972), pp. 92 ff.]. For further details on the controversy between Meinong and Witasek, cf. Raspa (2006a), pp. 62 ff.\n\nwhich  dealt  uniquely  with  the  objects  of  representations;  yet,  after  the discovery of objectives (1902), Meinong deems it obvious that (1) these are in turn higher-order objects and (2) that some objectives are monadic and do not repose on a plurality of inferiora - for example, 'A exists'-; it follows that, (3) since objects of higher order do not always necessitate a plurality of inferiora, nothing prevents us from considering aesthetic objects as objects of higher order. On this account, it is clear that Meinong's theoretical difficulties stem from the absence of an explicit theory of relations, laid out from the viewpoint of a full-blown object theory.\n\nSumming  up:  Witasek  develops  a  psychological  aesthetics,  i.e.  an aesthetics whose foundation - in his own words - is 'strictly psychological,' 97 and which rests in an essential way - as we have seen - on Meinongian concepts (such as the distinction between real and ideal objects, judgment and assumption, objecta and objectives). Nevertheless, as Martinelli also remarks, he does not assume those theses of Meinong's which are more genuinely metaphysical. This approach, properly spelt out, could provide an answer to the criticism that Peter Mahr levels against Witasek in his contribution to this volume. How can Witasek hold together the object  theory  and  psychological  aesthetics?  Because  he  does  not  assume those  object-theoretic  views  of  Meinong's  which  ground  the  concept  of Daseinsfreiheit . The object theory stands or falls with the principle of independence and the theory of extra-being, yet neither is ever mentioned by  Witasek;  furthermore,  in  'Über  ästhetische  Objektivität',  he  denies that  aesthetic  objects  can  be  given  outside-of-being,  and  even  that  they are objects of higher order.\n\n## 4. Variations on Witasek's aesthetics\n\nAs we saw above, Witasek had a certain influence on the psychological research of his time. However, his views stirred critical reaction as soon as the Grundzüge der allgemeinen Ästhetik were published. While Johannes Volkelt and Gustav J. von Allesch (1892-1967) took sides with him,\n\n97\n\nother scholars criticized some aspects of his work - among them, Theodor Lipps,  Jonas  Cohn  (1869-1947),  Anna  Tumarkin  (1875-1951),  Edith Landmann-Kalischer (1877-1951), and Wilbur M. Urban (1873-1952). 98 When  the Grundzüge were  translated  into  Italian  in  1912,  they  had  a mixed  reception,  with  Benedetto  Croce  (1866-1952)  and  Francesco  De Sarlo (1864-1937) taking opposite sides. The former attributed 'no value' to the psychological aesthetics which prevailed in Germany, because - he argued - those psychologists lacked artistic competence and speculative ability; even though he considered Witasek's book 'the best that psychological aesthetics has said up to now or has to say,' 99 his overall judgment was ironic and uncomplimentary. In contrast, Francesco De Sarlo appreciated  the  volume  and  described  Witasek  as  'one  of  the  most  talented German  representatives  of  the  psychological  current  in  aesthetics,'  and his book as 'a seminal work.' 100 'The analysis of the aesthetic attitude as a  psychical  function'  -  wrote  De  Sarlo  -  'and  the  determination  of  the laws that rule the creative process as well as the assessment of beauty, are not only fruitful, but indispensable for any truly critical inquiry.' 101\n\nReactions  to  Witasek's  work  came  also  -  as  we  have  seen  -  from within the Graz school. Besides Meinong, 102 Saxinger and Schwarz, critical  reflections  were  set  forth  by  Ameseder  and  Steno  Tedeschi  (18811911).  Both  commented  favourably  on  the Grundzüge ,  and  proposed some further  developments  of  the  theory,  which  in  turn  met  with  Witasek's approval. 103\n\nLike  Meinong, Witasek,  Ehrenfels  and  other  exponents  of  the  Graz school, Ameseder was a music enthusiast; he composed, and partly published, Lieder and  choral  songs,  which  earned  him  membership  of  the\n\n98 For an account of the reactions to the Grundzüge der allgemeinen Ästhetik , and a brief response to the main objections, cf.

After studying philosophy and art history at the University of Graz, Ameseder obtained his PhD in  1901  under  Meinong's  and  Spitzer's  supervision;  the  following year he became assistant at the Institute of Art History of the University of Graz, and in 1913 he was appointed coordinator ( Referent ) of art history at the Ministry of Education in Vienna. I have already mentioned his contribution to the theory of production of representations. Ameseder discusses Witasek's ideas in two articles published in 1906, where he makes explicit references to the Grundzüge . Starting out from the distinction between value-feelings and aesthetic feelings 104 - which we are already familiar  with  -,  he  tries  to  elaborate  on  Witasek's  idea  of  value  beauty ( Wertschönheit ), defined as the kind of beauty that pertains to the objects of  the  third  class  (i.e.  the  class  of  aesthetic  objects  which  conform  to  a norm,  and  therefore  possess  a  value).  In  the  course  of  his  inquiry,  he dwells upon the notion of habit, which he takes to be central for the purposes of evaluation: habits - he argues - possess the capacity of creating not only needs, but also values. This point will be resumed and developed by Steno Tedeschi.\n\nAlthough  he  did  not  belong  to  the  Graz  school,  Tedeschi  may  be numbered among Witasek's students, as well as among Meinong's. Born in  Trieste,  a  cousin  of  Italo  Svevo  (1862-1928),  he  had  studied  in  Graz (1904-1906), and subsequently he had tried to spread the theories of the Graz school in Italy, devoting a number of articles both to the object theory  and  to  Witasek's  aesthetics. As  part  of  this  effort,  he  undertook  the aforesaid  Italian  translation  of  the Grundzüge der allgemeinen Ästhetik ; after his tragic death in 1911 - he took his own life beside the death bed of  his  mother,  Peppina  Tedeschi 105 -  the  project  was  completed  by Mariano Graziussi. 106\n\nWhile  the  article  'La  coscienza  estetica  secondo  Stefano  Witasek [The  aesthetic  consciousness  according  to  Stefan  Witasek]'  (1907)  is  a short  comprehensive  introduction  to  the Grundzüge  der  allgemeinen\n\n104 Cf.

Raspa (2006c), pp. 15 f.\n\nÄsthetik , Tedeschi subsequently devoted three essays to a critical analysis of  Witasek's  conception  of  value  and  beauty,  and  to  their  relation  with habit. Beauty - he writes - is an object of value, since it can have value in other words, value can be ascribed to it; yet, it is not a value. It is true, instead, that things may have a value to us because they are beautiful; on the other hand, the value of an object can affect our aesthetic judgment. 107 Tedeschi, like Ameseder, begins by analyzing the third class of Witasek's elementary aesthetic objects, that is, objects which are beautiful because they conform to a norm: the common feature of these objects - as I hinted above - is the possession of a value, and this is what determines our aesthetic  attitude.  Value-feelings  are  judgment-feelings,  and  therefore  presuppose the existence of the object which is being evaluated; on this account,  as  we  know,  they  are  distinct  from  aesthetic  feelings,  which  are representation-feelings. 108 Taking up a remark by Ameseder, Tedeschi argues that habit has a considerable potential for creating values: 109 for example, we develop affection for an object to which we have grown accustomed. At the same time, while he credits Ameseder as the first who theorized the link between habits and evaluations, Tedeschi dissents from him over the possibility of formulating a general law, whereby acquaintance with an object would always result in a creation of value. In his view, this may fail to happen when habit involves feelings or sensations - in fact, the  effect  in  that  case  could  even  be  reversed  -,  whereas  habit  creates value  if  it  concerns  the  produced  representations  ( rappresentazioni  prodotte ). 110 A melody may be difficult to appreciate when it is heard for the first time, yet it becomes gradually more enjoyable on subsequent listenings.  Habit  facilitates  the  apperception  of  the  produced  representations and  thus  enhances  the  enjoyment,  for  a  smaller  effort  means  a  greater pleasure; thus, since apperceiving implies an existential judgment - and a feeling induced by an existential judgment is a value-feeling -, it is not\n\n107 Cf.

In order for an object to be valuable for us, we need to associate its representation with the belief that it exists; objects to whose existence we are accustomed acquire a value, as soon as we associate them with the hypothesis of their non-existence. 112 This is why - says Tedeschi - 'our habit values are hidden values.' 113 In connection with habit, he also examines the apperceptions of representations, aesthetic enjoyment, and the concept of Gestalt , understood as the shape of a melody, but also as a fashionable shape (e.g. for a dress).\n\n## 5. The contributions of Ehrenfels and Veber\n\nWe  have  seen  that  the  notion  of  Gestalt  draws  Witasek  closer  to Ehrenfels,  elicits  Meinong's  reflections  and  is  variously  employed  by several  representatives  of  the  Graz  school.  Still,  the  formulation  of  the concept of Gestalt is not Ehrenfels' only contribution to aesthetics. It has been correctly observed that his general point of view may be described as anti-sceptical. 114 In 'Was ist Schönheit?' (1906), Ehrenfels asserts that a  beautiful  object,  or  an  object  possessing  aesthetic  properties,  does  not identify with its material support, for the properties that make it an aesthetic object are different from those that pertain to its material correlate or support. It is true that the material correlate cooperates in determining the identity of the aesthetic object; yet it is not to the external object (to the transcendent object, in Witasek's words) that we ascribe the property\n\n111 Cf. Tedeschi (1907b), pp. 25 ff.\n\n112 Cf. Tedeschi (1909a), p. 50.\n\n113 Tedeschi (1909a), p. 53.\n\n114 Cf. Haller (1986), p. 172; Reicher (2006), pp. 319 ff. In the dialogue 'Was ist Schönheit?', the two antagonists are precisely the author and a sceptic. For a biography of Ehrenfels, cf. Fabian (1986b).\n\nof  beauty.  Beauty  is  an  object  of  thought  ( Gedankending )  in  the  same manner as Pythagoras' theorem. 115\n\nLike the rest of the school, Ehrenfels views the aesthetic object as an object  which  provokes  a  certain  kind  of  reaction,  or  rather,  which can provoke it. The role of the subject is therefore fundamental to him; this, however, does not lead him to profess a sort of relativism. In order to appreciate  a  melody,  it  is  necessary  to  reproduce  it  with  the  support  of memory and the help of imagination, 116 as may clearly be seen when we recognize a piece of music we have previously listened to. The melody must  be  reproduced;  otherwise,  it  cannot  be  appreciated.  This  is  made possible by the subject's disposition ( Disposition ),  without which a melody can by no means be apprehended or enjoyed. It is this  disposition, and not the relativity of aesthetic taste, which accounts for the different aesthetic judgments expressed by different individuals on the same object: different subjects listening to a musical excerpt - Ehrenfels explains - reproduce  different  complexes  of  representations  ( Vorstellungskomplexe ), so  that  one  of  them  will  judge  the  excerpt  beautiful,  while  another  will not. 117\n\nAnother representative of the Graz school who attributes a key role to the  notion  of  Gestalt  in  aesthetics  is  France Veber.  He  was  a  student  in Graz from 1912 to 1917 and did his doctorate with Meinong, with a dissertation  entitled Der  Gegenstand  Sollen  ist  zu  untersuchen  und  den Grundproblemen  der  Ethik  nutzbar  zu  machen (1917).  Even  though  he developed his own philosophy over the years, his Estetika (1925) is imbued with Meinongian ideas, to the point that it has been described as 'an application  of  the  Meinongian Gegenstandstheorie to  aesthetic  problems.' 118\n\nAs  Meinong  and  Witasek  before  him,  Veber  undertakes  a  careful analysis  of  the  aesthetic  experience.  Unlike  Witasek,  however,  he  conceives aesthetics as a normative discipline, where a central role is played\n\n115 Cf. Ehrenfels (1906), II, p. 156.\n\n116 Cf. Haller (1986), p. 174.\n\n117 Cf. Ehrenfels (1906), II, p. 168.\n\n118 Sajama (1987), p. 193; cf. also pp. 181 f.\n\n- as shown by Matjaž Potr č and Vojko Strahovnik - by the notion of value, and thus by the aesthetic judgment. Certainly, this does not exhaust the function of aesthetics, yet it underscores an essential point: we hold something  beautiful,  or  aesthetically  relevant,  insofar  as  we  evaluate  it.  Following Meinong, Veber argues that values are apprehended through emotions,  and  that  the  latter,  like  all  mental  phenomena,  are  necessarily  directed  to  an  object.  An  aesthetic  feeling  is  based  on  a  representation, which represents an object; both the feeling and the representation are addressed to the same object, which is an aesthetic object to the extent to which it possesses aesthetic properties. A mental experience, like a feeling,  is  therefore  called  aesthetic  insofar  as  it  is  directed  to  the  aesthetic properties which pertain to an object. Once more - as in Meinong, Witasek, and Ehrenfels - a key role is played by the concept of Gestalt, more specifically of unreal Gestalt. 119 The latter is the true bearer of aesthetic properties - in other words, the objective correlate of the aesthetic judgment. A melody - Veber reiterates - is an object of higher order, which is based on the single notes but is also something more than the sum total of these notes; this 'something' is the structure, or Gestalt. We do not apprehend and appreciate a melody by representing to ourselves the individual notes, but only by reproducing its Gestalt within us with the aid of imagination - whose role in aesthetics has been duly underscored by Meinong, Witasek, and Ehrenfels. Thus, once more, we have a twofold analysis of the aesthetic experience, encompassing the emotional as well as the objective point of view, and resting in a crucial way on the concept of Gestalt, which is described as a higher-order object endowed with aesthetic properties.\n\nI have given an outline of the 'aesthetics of the Graz school', making occasional references to the essays collected in this volume. I would like to conclude by drawing attention once again to Peter Mahr's essay. Besides introducing an author who has not been cited so far - Fritz Heider (18961988), one of Meinong's last students - Mahr questions the very idea that the Graz school produced an aesthetics. In his view, Meinong's contribu-\n\n119 On the importance of the concept of unreal Gestalt in Veber's aesthetics, cf. Pirjevec (1972).\n\ntion to aesthetics does not exceed some general suggestions; Witasek, on the other hand, does elaborate an aesthetics, but fails to offer a philosophical foundation for its object-theoretic presuppositions.\n\nIt  was not the purpose of the present volume, still less of this introduction,  to  provide  a  complete  picture  of  the  aesthetics  of  the  Graz school. What we have attempted to do, rather, is to delineate a series of possible itineraries within the writings of those authors we have focused on,  thus  giving  a  sample  of  the  variety  and  fruitfulness  of  the  theories they developed. We hope that these reflections - addressed to scholars of aesthetics as well as of Meinong and his school - will stimulate debates and  further  investigations,  aimed  at  expanding  and  detailing  the  framework which has been outlined here.\n\nVenanzio Raspa Università degli Studi di Urbino 'Carlo Bo' venanzio.raspa@uniurb.it\n\n## Literature\n\nAlbertazzi,  Liliana,  Jacquette,  Dale  &amp;  Poli,  Roberto  [eds.]  (2001), The School of Alexius Meinong , Aldershot / Burlington USA / Singapore / Sydney, Ashgate.\n\nAllesch,  Christian  G.
