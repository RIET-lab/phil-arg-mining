    "user_content": "## Thinking, Conscience and Acting in Times of Crises\n\n## Introduction\n\nIf  there  is  one  lesson  that  Hannah  Arendt  drew  from  her  encounter  with  Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem it was that the moral and political dangers of thoughtlessness had  been  grossly  underestimated  (Formosa,  2007a).  However,  the  claim  that thoughtlessness is a  mass phenomenon is one that Arendt had already defended in The Human Condition . Indeed, the reason why Eichmann is, according to Arendt, so 'terrifyingly normal' (EJ: 206), is precisely because he is primarily characterised by thoughtlessness, a trait he  shares with  his  fellow  ' Animal Laborans ',  the  victorious 'jobholders' of modern mass society (HC:  320-25; see also BPF: 4-13). Of course, the  labelling  of  the ' masses ' as  thoughtless  and  inauthentic  has  been  a  persistent philosophical theme from Plato, through to Kant, Nietzsche, Heidegger and beyond. What is novel about Arendt's claim is her argument that there is a link between mass thoughtlessness  and  mass  evil,  the  type  of  large-scale  evil  that  can  only  be perpetrated with the support of the masses.\n\nArendt, however, remains cautious about recommending thoughtfulness per se as  a  panacea  to  modern  mass  thoughtlessness.  While  she  closes The  Human Condition ,  a  book  about  action, with  a  few  hopeful  words  beckoning  towards  the promise of thoughtfulness, her advocacy of the importance of action also leads her to claim that 'non -thinking … seems so recommendable a state for political and moral affairs'. While thoughtlessness clearly 'has its perils' ,  (LMT 177) as the example of Eichmann  illustrates,  thoughtfulness  has  its  own  problems,  as  the  example  of Heidegger illustrates. In the course of her 1964 interview with Günter Gaus, Arendt recalls her distaste for 'intellectual  business'  that  arose  from witnessing  the widespread and  'relatively  voluntary' Gleichshaltung (co-ordination)  of  German 'intellectuals'  with  the  Nazis  in  1933 (EU:  10).  This  was  the  year  that  Heidegger, Arendt's former teacher and friend , 'entered the Nazi Party in a very sensational way' (EU:  187).  Arendt,  in  a  1946  review, even  lists  Heidegger  as  one  of  'those outstanding  scholars  [who]  did  their  utmost  to  supply  the  Nazis  with  ideas  and techniques' (EU: 201). But Heidegger is for Arendt also a paragon of thoughtfulness who  exposes  the 'incomprehensible  triviality' (or  banality) of  'the  they'  and  their 'mere  talk'  (MDT:  ix ;  see  also  Pitkin,  1998:  49-60).  This  raises  the  following question: how can thoughtfulness, in the guise of Heidegger, and thoughtlessness, in the guise of Eichmann, both (though to a very different extent) lead to 'co -ordination' with the Nazis? What does this tell us about the relation between thinking and evil?\n\nArendt begins her account of thinking in The Life of the Mind with an attempt to  answer  this  question.  She  asks  there  (LMT:  5)  whether  the  mere  activity  of\n\nthinking  is  'among  the  conditions  that  make  men  abstain  from  evil -doing  or  even actuall y 'condition' them against it?' For Arendt, there are moral benefits to be gained from  simply  learning how to  think,  above  and  beyond  those  gained  from  learning what to  think  (RJ:  101).  However,  conditioning  implies  only  that,  as  a  result  of thinking, a person will be less likely, inclined or disposed to perpetrate or support evil. But how might the sheer activity of thinking do this and do all types of thinking have this same effect? In order to answer this question I shall examine Arendt's distinction between critical and professional thinking, and her account of conscience, in order to argue how and why critical (but not professional) thinking can condition against evil. Drawing on this argument, I then proceed to critically investigate Arendt's account of the masses, conscience, and action in times of crises.\n\n## Critical Thinking\n\nFor  Arendt,  thinking  along  with  willing  and  judging  are  the  three  autonomous, spontaneous and independent faculties that comprise the life of the mind. The activity of thinking, as with all the activities of the mind, is hidden from the world and thereby involves  a  'deliberate  withdrawal  from  appearances' (LMT:  75).  The  hidden  and withdrawn  nature  of  the  mind  inevitably  puts  it  in  constant  'tension'  with  action, which can only occur in the world of appearances (RJ: 105). Arendt bases her account of thinking on Kant's distinction between reason ( Vernunft ), 'the urge to think and to understand',  and  intellect  ( Verstand ),  'which  desires  and  is  capable  of  certain, verifiable knowledge' (RJ: 163). T his distinction, according to Arendt, 'coincides with two altogether different mental activities, thinking and knowing, and two altogether different concerns, meaning … and cognition [respectively] ' (LM T: 14). This is not to say that there is no thinking involved in knowing, but only that in such cases thinking remains a mere reasoning tool or 'handmaiden' for the intellect's quest for knowledge (LMT: 61; see also Deutscher, 2007: 16). With this distinction Arendt sees Kant as liberating thinking by differentiating it from knowledge, and thereby opening up room for  reason  to  think  about  issues  that  lay  beyond  what  can  be  known,  but  which remain  of  'the  greatest  existential  interest  to  man' (LMT:  15).  However,  when thinking goes beyond the limits of what can be known, by asking questions about the meaning of facts or stories, or by addressing ethical or political issues, it remains a never-ending or open-ended activity. Arendt accentuates this non-finality, this going around  in  circles  (LMT:  124), by  likening  thinking  to  'Penelope's  web,'  in  that  it 'undoes every morning what it has finished the night before' (L MT: 88).\n\nIt is here that Arendt, despite her close affinities with Kant, makes her decisive break with Kantian moral theory. The critique of pure reason by reason, for Arendt, goes around forever in circles, whereas for Kant, it shows us (among other things)\n\nthat a rational belief in freedom and the accompanying moral law can withstand the destructive power of such a critique. Arendt thus uses a Kantian distinction from the First  Critique,  between  thinking  and  knowing,  to  deny  a  Kantian  position  from  the Second Critique, namely that thinking can practically ground universally valid moral and  political  norms,  rather  than  only  destructively  undermine  them  (RJ:  159-189). Arendt claims that thinking and meaning remain forever unstable and non-definitive, whereas  Kant  claims  that  we  can  strike  solid  ground  in  practical  matters  through critical reflection and the recognition of the absolute value of humanity.\n\nIn any case, how might stopping and thinking, in order to re-present thoughtobjects  in  the  pursuit  of  meaning,  condition  against  evil?  Indeed,  this  thesis  might seem to be a non-starter for the following reasons. If the thesis is correct, then we would expect that the more frequent and the deeper a person thinks, the greater the conditioning effect. But there does not seem to be any such effect. As we have seen, Heidegger's deep and frequent thoughtfulness did not prevent his 'error' or 'lack of judgment' (as Bernstein (1996: 174) puts it) in regard to his support of the Nazis in 1933. If we find a wide spread willingness to support the racist agenda of the Nazi party  among  both  the  thoughtful  intellectual  elites,  such  as  Heidegger,  and  the thoughtless many, such as Eichmann (Villa, 1999: 86), then this would seem to refute Arendt's claims about the conditioning effects of thinking.\n\nHowever,  Arendt's  position  is more  complex,  as  she  makes  an  important distinction  between 'critical  thinkers', of  whom  Socrates  and  Kant  in  particular,  but also  the  likes  of  Lessing  and  Jaspers, are  Arendt's  exemplars,  and  'profession al thinkers' ( Denker  von  Gewerbe )    (LMT:  3),  of  whom  Heidegger  is  an  important exemplar. The professional thinker is not simply someone whose job it is to think, for both Heidegger and Jaspers earned a living from thinking. Rather the difference lies in the way or mode of thinking, as I shall make clear below. This distinction is important for Arendt because not all thinking, but only critical thinking, has a conditioning effect against evil, or so I shall argue.\n\nAll  thinking  for  Arendt  is  withdrawn  and  isolated,  or  similarly  private  and monological. But only 'critical thinking , according to Kant and according to Socrates, exposes  itself  to  'the  test  of  free  and  open  examination,'  and  this  means  that  the more people participate in it, the better' (KPP: 39). Cr itical thinking is 'representative' or  'enlarged'  thinking, and  this  involves  thinking  through  an  issue  from  as  many different standpoints as possible (BPF: 241). For Kant this leads to 'pluralism' as a 'way  of  thinking',  whereby  other  citizens  are  neede d  as  a necessary 'touchstone', though not a replacement, for one's own thinking (2006: 7:128-30). It is this need for a touchstone that leads Kant to claim that the 'freedom to speak and to publish' and  to  make  'public  use  of  one's  reason'  is  the  most  impo rtant  political  freedom (KPP: 39). This is because without a space for the public use of reason, without 'the\n\ntest of free and open examination,' Arendt argue s that 'no thinking and no opinion -formation are possible ' (KPP: 40) . While Arendt somewhat overstates the case to say that no thinking and no opinion forming are possible for the thinker without a public space for the testing of their ideas, she is right to point out that critical thinking does require such a space or, more accurately, can't survive t oo long (or at least flourish) without it. Kant makes a similar point: 'Thus one can very well say that this external power which wrenches away people's freedom publicly to communicate their thoughts also takes from them the freedom to think ' (1996a: 8:144).\n\nIn stark contrast, the professional thinker is one who 'presupposes that I am capable of m aking up my mind all by myself' (KPP: 39). While all thinking is hidden and  withdrawn,  critical thinkers  'cannot  endure  living  constantly  in'  the  worl d  of isolated thought (MDT: 76). For the critical thinker reason is dialogical, in the sense that though thinking itself is monological, it remains tentative and inconclusive until it can test itself publicly against the reason of a plurality of others. For the professional thinker such public testing is not an integral and essential part of the thinking process itself.  The  former  publicise  their  preliminary  reasoning  so  as  to  enter  into  dialogue with others in order to obtain representative opinions, whereas the latter simply state their  already  definitive  conclusions (no  Penelope's  web  here) .  We  can  think  of  the professional thinker as stuck permanently at the level of what Hegel (1952: § 140150; see also Houlgate, 2005: 181-210 and Wood, 1993) calls the moral standpoint, convinced that their convictions alone define what is right (or true). In contrast, the critical thinker has progressed to what Hegel calls an ethical standpoint, whereby they see themselves not as the absolute and infallible arbitrators of what is right, but as active participants in the public shaping of collective self-understanding of rightness through dialogue. The critical thinker has the intellectual and ethical humility to find a middle ground between abdicating their rationality to the status quo or the views of others  and  arrogantly  asserting  with  the  professional  thinker  their  right  to  alone determine what is right in utter disregard to the plurality of the public realm.\n\nArendt's account of the critical thinker is able to resolve the above d ifficulties concerning the conditioning effects of thinking, and explain the potential dangers of both thoughtfulness and thoughtlessness. To think critically is to think independently, and  this 'purifying event' results in the 'liberation from  prejudices … [and] authorities' (KPP: 31). This 'destructive' nature of critical thinking has a 'paralysing effect' which makes that which was once 'beyond doubt while you were unthinkingly engaged in whatever you were doing' no longer seem so certain (LMT: 175-6). The critical  thinker  stops  and  thinks,  whereas  the  thoughtless  masses  simply,  as  if  by habit (and ' mores ' mean ' customs and habits ' -see (RJ: 50)), carry on as if nothing out of the ordinary is happening. They just do what everyone else does, even when wha t everyone else does is murder. The ' thoughtless ' person is one who, according\n\nto  Kant,  ' regards  everything  that  he  undertakes  as  easy ' (2006:  7:148-49).  In contrast, due to the destructive and purifying nature of thinking, the critical thinker does  not  regard  anything  they  undertake  of  any  importance  to  be  easy.  As  such, critical  thinking  conditions  the  thinker  against  being  swept  along  thoughtlessly  by mass movements that can lead to evil.\n\nCritical thinking has a further conditioning effect, as it sets the foundation for (but  does  not  guarantee)  representative  judgment.  Good  judgment  requires  the ability  to  put  aside  prejudices  and  appreciate  the  particularity  of  individual  cases. Critical thinking is able to set the foundation for good judgment by acclimatising the thinker to regularly considering their opinions from a plurality of perspectives, which leads  to  both  impartiality  and  an  acute  awareness  of  the  nuances  of  difference.  In contrast,  the  isolation  and  aloofness  of  professional  thinking,  deaf  as  it  is  to  the plurality  of  the  public  realm,  tends  not  to  have  this  effect,  and  this  can  lead  to insensitivity to difference and an inflexible, dogmatic certainty that can wither away one's  faculty  of  judgment. This  failure  to  embrace  an  enlarged  and  representative perspective through dialogue with others may help to fill in a small part of the picture as to why so many professional thinkers, of whom Heidegger is the exemplar, lacked good political judgment when the Nazis came into power. In any case, this at  least explains one way that Arendt is able to conceptually handle the case of the unethical professional thinker who lacks good judgment.\n\nBut a withered faculty of judgment is not the only or the worst danger. Far more  worrying  are  the  dangers  of  nihilism,  dogmatism  and  ideology  that  are  an 'ever -present danger of thinking' (LM T: 176). These dangers are best illustrated by the fact that so much evil is the result of thinking and the spread of poisonous ideas. The  danger  of  such  ideas  lies  not  least  in  their  ability  to  become  ideologies  which claim 'total validity' (see Formosa, 2006: 503, and OT: 473-4). While the thoughtless many  may  get  swept  along  with  everyone  else  into  a  blind  commitment  to  such popular  ideologies,  many  thoughtful  people  can  become  convinced  by  them,  even fanatically so. When this happens the 'results of thinking will then be used with the sam e unthinking routine as before' (LMT: 176). As such, these dangers of dogmatic certainty,  ideological  system-building  and  nihilism  are  not  so  much  dangers  of thinking  itself,  but  of  a 'desire  to  find  results  that  would  make  further  thinking unnecessary' (LMT: 176). Nonetheless, thinking cannot go around in circles forever. At  some  stage  thinking  must  stop,  even  if  only  for  a  moment.  But  for  the  critical thinker, 'each time you are confronted with some difficulty in life you have to make up your mind anew' (LM T: 177), whereas convinced or committed ideologues never face any new difficulties in life. Everything is easy for them because they think that they alone already have all the important answers. They refuse to be stung back into reflection  and  sanctify  their  convictions  as  beyond  question.  Critical  thinking,  in  its\n\nopenness to plurality, thereby conditions against evil by avoiding the twin dangers of common thoughtlessness and unethical professional thoughtfulness.\n\n## Conscience\n\nArendt  argues  that  a 'genuine'  conscience  (see  Vetlesen,  2001:  18 -19)  is  a  byproduct of the activity of thinking and not simply the presence of consciousness. This is because thinking is dialectical, whereas consciousness is intentional. While there is always  a  certain  'duality'  inherent  in  the  reflective  nature  of  consciousness,  this duality is only 'actualised' in the 'solitude' of the two -in-one of thinking (LMT: 74-5). As s uch, conscience arises out of the dialectical nature of thinking, as in thinking 'I am both the one who asks and the one who answers' (LMT: 185), that is, I am two -inone.  This  inner  difference,  this  literally  'having  to  live  with  oneself',  is  the foundation of conscience.\n\nArendt  argues  that  conscience  plays  only  a  constraining  role,  by  placing barriers in one's way and advising on the pain of being unable to live with oneself that one  ought not to  perform  certain  actions.  Thus  for  Arendt  both  conscience  and authentic (or Socratic) morality are 'entirely negative' (CR: 63). Conscience only says 'don't' and never 'do'. For this reason conscience is anti -political (see May, 1983: 60), as it not only values the integrity of the self over the state of the world, but it also undermines  and  never  counsels  action  (CR:  60-1).  Of  course,  we  often  think  of conscience as issuing positive imperatives to act -such as, 'I couldn't live with myself if I didn't do something'. But Arendt denies this because she denies that thinking can ever reach positive conclusions. Thinking, in going around  forever in circles, undermines any and all reasons we have for acting and, as such, it cannot issue any reasons for acting which it cannot simultaneously undermine. Critical thinking is for Arendt  so  tentative  and  non-final  as  to  lack  the  resources  to  issue  positive  moral imperatives to act (RJ: 122). Judgment must bridge this gap.\n\nArendt's account of conscience endorses Aristotle's analysis of the base man as one whose 'relations with themselves are not friendly' and who, as a consequence, must either 'do away with' himself or 'seek the company of others' (LMW: 59). The base man, in other  words,  can  no  longer  live  with  themselves  in  solitude.  For  this reason Arendt argues that a good conscience is a precondition for the very ability to think.  In  order  to  think,  one's  two -in-one  must  be  on  speaking  terms,  and  so  one must be able to be 'friends' with oneself (LMT: 187-8). But, according to Arendt, one cannot be friends with an evildoer (LMT: 188). However, this claim is too strong for a number  of  reasons.  Firstly,  there  is  clearly  some  sort  of  Aristotelian  account  of friendship  underlying  this  position  (see  PP:  21).  But  on  some  non-Aristotelian accounts  of  friendship,  it  is  possible  to  be  friends  with  an  evildoer,  so  long  as  you\n\nknow that they are unlikely to be evil to you (see Wood, 1999: 277). In any case, even Aristotle (2001: 1156b), allows for a sort of lesser friendship, based in 'pleasure or  utility',  between  those  who  are  bad  and  th ose  who  are  good,  or  both  bad,  or neither  good  nor  bad.  Secondly,  it  is  not  only  friends  that  are  on  speaking  terms. Sometimes  the  worst  of  enemies  can  converse.  Only  a  peace  treaty,  and  not friendship, is required for dialogue to take place. As such, an inability to be friendly with oneself would not seem to be fatal to the thinking process per se.\n\nBut  in  some  cases  it  may  be.  Arendt  makes  much  of Socrates'  claim  (in Gorgias : 469c) that, though he wishes neither, it is better to suffer wrong than inflict it. Socrates would rather die or be at odds with the whole world, than be at odds with himself  (RJ:  100).  This  is  because  Socrates  could  not  live  with  himself  if  he  were unjust or a wrongdoer. As Socrates values the examined life as the only one worth living ( Apology : 38a), he has a very strong interest in never becoming a wrongdoer. In Socrates' case, the valuing of the examined life generates an interest in morality and his own integrity.\n\nBut while Socrates would rather die than give up the examined life, the claims conscience  makes  on  the  rest  of  us  are  surely  somewhat  less.  Many  do  not,  like Socrates, value the examined life as the only one worth living. Such people are willing to put up with some moral self-disapproval in order to get something they value more highly, be it wealth, power, revenge, or pleasure. In any case, moral self-disapproval is often easy enough to get rid of through self-deception, rationalisation, compartmentalisation  and  gradual  habituation.  As  Kant  notes  (1997:  27:356-7), through 'habituation'  one's  conscience  can  become  'as  accustomed  to  vice  as  to tobaccosmoke'. Arendt is perfectly clear that her account of conscience is phenomenological  and  descriptive,  rather  than  normative.  But Arendt's  account  of conscience is riddled by her error of overgeneralising Socrates' particular experience into  a  general  phenomenology of conscience. But Socrates had the conscience of a moral saint (see Formosa, 2007b: 238), and to generalise from his example is bound to be misleading.\n\nEven more troubling is the fact that there are, as Arendt notes, some people who  actually  ' prefer Bluebeard  for  company' (RJ:  146)  and,  as  such,  who  will  be more than happy to have an evildoer as their partner in silent dialogue. Such persons do not even require the falsity of self-deception to live with themselves. They may even wear their conscious moral rebellion as an existential badge of honour.  In any case, conscience can have a conditioning effect, by creating an interest in one's own moral integrity, for at least those people who cannot live with an evildoer.\n\nHowever,  the  usefulness  of  such  a  conditioning  effect  is  largely  negated  on Arendt's  account by  the  fact  that  most  people  do  not  have  a  genuine  conscience. Thoughtfulness is a precondition for having such a conscience, but Eichmann and his\n\nlike  are  primarily  characterised  by  thoughtlessness  and  thus  do  not  satisfy  this condition.  Hence  such  persons  have  at  best  the  sort  of ' artificial '  (as  opposed  to 'genuine') conscience that society inculcates into them. S uch persons are like Plato's Hippias who, when he goes home, 'remains one, for, though he lives alone, he does not seek to keep himself company' (LMT: 188). This requires one to live in a state of loneliness,  as  distinct  from  the  solitude  of  thinking.  But  loneliness  is  for  Arendt  a 'mass phenomenon' (HC:  59).  It  is  the  very  condition  of  labouring  (HC:  212)  and therefore  the  dominant  mode  of  being  for  the  jobholders  of  modern  mass  society. Unlike Socrates, the masses prefer the comfort of thoughtlessness to the angst of the examined life. But without the sting of conscience to jolt the thoughtless many out of blind conformity, there is literally no limit to what evil such people can perpetrate (RJ: 101, 146).\n\n## Thinking Critically\n\nThere are three difficulties in  Arendt's account of the rel ation between thinking and evil  which  I  shall  examine  here.  These  pertain  to  her  characterisation  of  the thoughtlessness  of  the  masses,  her  failure  to  consider  the  rebuilding  function  of conscience, and the lack of a positive role for action in times of crises.\n\nFor  Arendt  the  origins  of  the  masses  is  a  complicated  story,  but  one  that chiefly  focuses  on  the  atomisation of society that occurred as the public realm was swallowed  up  by  the  social,  thereby  resulting  in  a  society  of  jobholders  who, perpetually labouring and consuming, have lost their roots in a common plural intersubjective  world  (see  HC:  248-326, and section  one,  chapter  10,  'The  masses',  in OT: 305-26). Arendt locates 'equality of conditions' as the ' outstanding trait of mass society' (EU: 425), where this is understood as the 'equality of the laboring activity with, and even its precedence over, all ' other activities, including political action and thoughtfulness (EU: 435-6). This 'equality' manifests itself in a mass society in which alienated  people  either  live  in  lonely  separation  or  are  pressed  together  into  a crowded mass so 'that they seem to have become one' (EU: 406). There is no inbetween space for proper human relations to form (EU: 406), and this leads to the 'conformism' of the masses (EU: 423-7) whose members 'behave' rather than 'act' in thoughtlessly following social mores (HC: 322). This, Arendt claims, makes them the 'best  positive  'material'  for  [totalitarian]  movements' (EU:  406).  More  generally,  it makes them the best positive material for any mass populist movement, and Arendt in a 1954 essay considers McCarthyism as evidence that such mass movements are possible not just in pre-war Europe but in post-war America as well (EU: 423).\n\nBut  is  Arendt  here  simply  falling  back  on  the  old  philosophical  prejudices against the polis that she (PP: 81) sees as defining the Western tradition of political philosophy? Does it even make sense to make a distinction between the 'few' and the 'many', and to do so i n terms of thinking? If we keep in mind that by 'thinking' Arendt means pure reason, or thinking undertaken for its own sake, as opposed to thinking used as a tool for means-ends reasoning or knowledge acquisition, then it does not seem  implausible  to  claim  that  many  people  rarely,  if  ever,  engage  in  such  an activity. But this can and should remain a somewhat loose distinction. Thoughtlessness comes in degrees. Most people rarely engage in Socratic thinking, others  may  do  so  occasionally,  but  few  do  so  regularly,  even  among  so-called professional intellectuals. Most people most of the time have better things to do. As such, Arendt's distinction is not prima facie implausible if understood in this way.\n\nBut Arendt's claim about the masses' thoughtless followi ng of social mores is in fact stronger than my analysis thus far suggests . A society's mores , or ethical life in  Hegel's  sense, are  those  shared  values,  customs,  norms  and  rules  which  a community, as a whole, by and large identifies with, accepts and justifies their actions in terms of. As such, it is surely correct that most people (i.e. the masses) do in fact follow their community's mores. After all, such widespread acceptance is part of what makes that set of mores the mores of that particular community . But Arendt's claims go far beyond such trivialities. For her most people thoughtlessly follow their society's mores blindly , no matter the nature of those mores. For this reason, Arendt claims that the masses can blindly conform to any old set of mores, no matter how barbaric (RJ: 178).\n\nArendt  sees  the  dramatic  confirmation  of  her  thesis  in  the  changing  of  the German peoples' ethical mores from the old code ('thou shalt not kill') , to its opposite ('thou shalt kill') during the Nazi period, and then back again after the war, as if they were  changing  nothing  more  than  mere  'table  manners' (LMT:  177,  but  see  also Arendt, 1955: 023953 and RJ: 153). Arendt takes this to show that the masses are not thoughtfully committed to the content of any particular set of rules, but rather are thoughtlessly committed to the following of rules, whatever their content (LMT: 177). Thus  Arendt  claims  that:  ' If  somebody  appears  who … wishes  to  abolish  the  old 'values' or virtues, he will find that easy enough, provided he offer s a new code ... the more  firmly  men  hold  to  the  old  code,  the  more  eager  will  they  be  to  assimilate themselves to the new one' (LMT: 177).\n\nBut  this  is  a  particularly  controversial  way  of  reading  what  went  on  in  preand  post-war  Germany.  Alternatively,  we  might  instead  see  the  Nazis  as  drawing upon a distorted version of the old code by offering a 'self -defence' argument, based on false views concerning the threat posed by the mere existence of Jewish people. This is not a claim about how leading Nazis viewed the matter, but about the mores of\n\nthe  German  people. On  this  reading  the  ' Nazis  did  not  fundamentally  alter  basic ethical  convictions' (Haas,  1998:  7).  Of  course,  as  stated,  this  is  a  dramatic  and misleading  over-simplification,  although  no  more  so  t han  in  Arendt's  version  of events. There was surely something more complex and multifaceted going on in Nazi Germany.  However,  the  point  is  that,  on  this  alternative  reading,  it  was  not  the German peoples' ethical mores that fundamentally changed, self -defence has always been  justifiable,  but  rather  their  racial  views,  or  at  least  the  importance  and implications they drew from these in terms of the old code.\n\nTo kill was still an exception, even if killing was far from exceptional. In Nazi Germany the  class  of  exceptions  ballooned  enormously  to  include,  not  only  enemy combatants,  but  also  prisoners  of  war,  occupied  civilian  populations  and  all  those perceived  to  be  'racially  inferior'.  Certainly,  people  found  plenty  of  ways,  through rationalisation, self-deception and gradual habituation, to circumvent moral boundaries and 'justify' the perpetration of much evil. This  is  not  to  say  that every Nazi thought that their actions were 'justifiable', but only that at least some did, even if only through self-deception. But such Nazis never justified their actions in terms of the norm 'thou shalt kill', for if this were the case, murder would not be the sort of thing that needed to be justified. For example, some Nazis might have been able to 'live with themselves' onl y by actually believing that: their actions were justified ones done for the sake of defending racial purity; or that Jews were not really 'persons' at all;  or  that  they  were 'only following orders' and 'someone else would have done it anyway'.  But  if  such Nazis  genuinely  subscribed  to  the  norm  'thou  shalt  kill,'  then such rationalising and self-deception would be not only unnecessary but unintelligible.\n\nThis might imply that Arendt is wrong to think that any old set of ethical norms can function as a socie ty's mores. It seems implausible that people could thoughtlessly  swallow any set  of  mores,  no  matter  how  brutal  or  revolting.  People must, as Hegel reminds us, be able to see some sort of rationality in them (see Wood, 1993: 228; see also Habermas, 1990: 62). Thus even if most people are in general thoughtless,  they  are  not that thoughtless.  For  Arendt  the  masses  take  on  board ethical values like they take on board table manners. As such, 'it should be no more difficult to change the mores and habits of a people than it would be to change their table  manners' (LMT:  177).  Arendt  thereby  fails,  refuses  or  lacks  the  conceptual resources  to  make  the  customary  distinction  between  rules  of  conduct  which  are genuinely  arbitrary,  like  table  manners,  and  rules  that  have  some  sort  of  rational foundation, like treating other persons with respect. This leads Arendt to conflate, too directly and too simplistically, all ethical norms with any and all other purely arbitrary norms,  like  table  manners.  Whatever  the  similarities,  ethical  norms  are  not  as malleable, as arbitrary, as variable, as insignificant and as rationally unjustifiable as table manners.\n\nThis does not, however, undermine Arendt's claims about the banality of evil. Arendt's point here is only that even, or especially, 'normal' people, the 'respectable pillars of society' (LMT: 177), will thoughtlessly follow social mores all the way into evil, where that is where those mores lead. When evil is normalised, when it becomes part of 'what one does' in a certain so ciety, as happened in Nazi Germany, it takes only an unexceptional (rather than an exceptional) person to perpetrate evil. In such situations, as Arendt notes, the 'sad truth of the matter is that most evil is done by people who never made up their minds t o be or do either evil or good' (LMT: 180). It took  no  special  decision  to  perpetrate  evil  in  Nazi  Germany.  Indeed,  quite  the opposite. But we can accept this position without also accepting the stronger claim that  the  masses  can  and  will  thoughtlessly  follow  and  identify  with any old  set  of ethical  norms.  We  can  do  so  because,  while  the  masses  can  be  manipulated  into perpetrating  acts  which,  if  thoughtfully  reflected  upon,  clearly  violate  their  ethical values, they cannot quite so easily be manipulated into identifying with, consciously adopting and reflectively endorsing any old set of ethical values (such as 'thou shalt kill').\n\nThe  second  issue  with  Arendt's  account  that  I  shall  address  here  can  be illustrated  by  asking  the  question:  what  if  Eichmann  had become thoughtful?  On becoming thoughtful and examining his character and actions Eichmann should have discovered that he was living with a murderer. The result of this, on Arendt's account, is that Eichmann should literally no longer have been able to think. This is because he should no longer have been able to live or speak with himself, given the radical evil that  he  had  perpetrated.  As  we  have  seen ,  conscience,  on  Arendt's  account,  can counsel just two options: either kill yourself or avoid your own company (LMW: 59). In either case, further thinking is impossible.\n\nBut there is a third option which Arendt overlooks (and Kant (1997: 27:35356) does not). Conscience not only does work before an  act,  warning us not to act wrongly, but it also does work after an act, compelling us to make amends for wrongs committed. Arendt's account completely ignores this 'working through' or 'rebuilding' function  of  conscience,  whereby  we  are  compelled  to  compensate  those  we  have wronged,  so  that  we  might  come  to  live  with  ourselves  in  peace  once  again.  In Eichmann's case we would expect (or hope) that conscience would prompt him to try and perform such actions that might 'redeem' him, such as to immediately quit the Nazis  and  join  the  resistance,  or  attempt  to  transport  as  many  Jews  to  safety  as possible, etc. Conscience has a post-evil reconciliatory function which leaves open the possibility of speaking and living with oneself even after the worst acts, provided that one is committed to reforming oneself and making amends in the future.\n\nArendt's purely negative account of conscience and morality leads to another problem. Arendt advocates that in times of 'emergency' or 'crisis', when the moral\n\n'stakes are down', the thing to do is not to engage in action (LMT: 192-3; but see also  RJ:  122-3,  188-9).  This  is  because  it  is  only  in  times  of  crisis  that  thinking  is anything but 'a politically marginal activity' (LMT: 192), as it is only in such times that many of us are faced with decisions in which whether we will be able to live with ourselves or not is a consideration of central importance (RJ: 104). As such, we are thrown back upon our conscience, in which 'the self' is 'the ultimate criterion', and this  becomes  politically  a  kind  of  'emergency  measure' (RJ:  104).  But  conscience, 'which will never tell you what to do, only prevent you from doing certain things' (RJ: 105) , places stumbling blocks in your way and this ideally leads to a 'refusal to join in'  which,  given  the  times,  is  'conspicuous'  and  so  amounts  to  'a  kind  of  action' (LMT: 192).\n\nIn times of crises the critical thinker, by necessity, temporarily gives up on the project  of  achieving  an  ethical  life  based  in  representative  norms  formed  through judgment and dialogue in the public realm, and falls back on the moral standpoint of conscience in which the self, and not the world we share and create with others, is primary. Thus Arendt argues that ' the marginal situation in which moral propositions become absolutely valid in the realm of politics is impotence' ( RJ: 156). In times of crises  we  are  forced  back  on  ourselves  for  we  are  literally  powerless.  Power  is  for Arendt  the  ability  to  freely  act  in  concert  with  others  in  a  plural  public  realm  (see Habermas, 1977). But without power, we are impotent and cannot act. We are forced into  an  'inner  emigration',  the  'flight  from  the  world  in  dark  times'  that  Arendt praised in Jaspers (MDT: 22, 76). Arendt therefore likens 'heroic resistance' against tyrannies to mere 'strength' (as opposed to power), for tyrannies abolish the plural public space and with it the very space from which action could spring (HC: 202-3). As such, we need not do anything, as 'powerlessness … is  a  valid  excuse for doing nothing' (RJ:  156). Thus  when  the  moral  stakes  are  down,  both  Arendt's  purely negative account of conscience and her restrictive understanding of power and action (see Breen, 2007 and Allen, 2002), forces her to conclude that all we can and ought to do is not thoughtlessly join in like Eichmann (see Kateb, 1984: 101).\n\nFrom this it is obv ious that while conscience 'may indeed prevent catastrophes … for the self ' (LOM 193), it will do little to stop the spread of evil in the world. As such, Arendt seems to miss the importance of Machiavelli's argument, which she was fond of quoting, that to not 'resist evil' has the result that 'wicked rulers do as much evil  as  they  please' (HC  78).  The  thrust  of  this  argument  is  that,  contra  Arendt, especially in times of crisis it is important to also care for the world and not just for the self. While merely abstaining from supporting a law or regime through peaceful civil disobedience may be the only morally legitimate form of dissent in (or against) a functioning democracy, the same cannot be said (let's assume) for those living under tyrannical, despotic or totalitarian regimes that are not responsive to the public use of\n\nreason. Such regimes do not rely on the consent of a majority of their citizens, and so merely abstaining from giving that consent is alone unlikely to seriously challenge the re gime's stability and powerbase, or pressure it to reconsider its policies (although in some cases it might).\n\nIndeed, it may even have the opposite effect, because to not act in such times may be conspicuous, but not for the reasons that Arendt thinks. Non-action in such times may be conspicuous as it encourages and aids the perpetrators of evil to keep on doing what they are doing, because the silence of bystanders is often read as tacit acceptance  (see  Staub,  2003:  292,  331-2).  Arendt  praises  the merits  of  'passi ve resistance' as an effective force, because it 'cannot be countered by fight ing … but only by mass slaughter' (HC: 201). But passive resistance can only be effective if it is organised  on  a  large  enough  scale,  which  the  likes  of  the  Nazis  would  never  have allowed, and if the regime that is being resisted will, unlike the Nazis, not find mass slaughter  politically  unpalatable.  When  one  lives  under,  or  faces,  a  totalitarian  or authoritarian regime intent on perpetrating radical evil or maintaining its position at all costs, there comes a time when action and resistance is politically necessary, and arguably even morally obligatory.\n\nIn any case, at least some people have found that in such situations to not actively resist evil regimes is something that their conscience would not let them live with. Arendt endorses Thoreau's claim that conscience does not 'compel us to right wrongs', but only to not 'support them' (CR: 60). But when it is radical evils that we deal with, Arendt is wrong to claim that 'conscience requires nothing more' (CR: 60). For some people at least, their conscience compels them to do something more in the form of active resistance.\n\nArendt claims that to 'act' (in any official capacity) during the Nazi regime, for example,  would  have  invol ved  becoming,  to  some  extent,  complicit  in  the  Nazi's atrocities.  But  do  not  the  resistance  fighters  and  rescuers,  those  acting  outside  of, and in resistance to, the official 'public space', show us that action is still  possible, even in such dark times? Are not such heroic moral resisters acting and not merely employing strength ? Indeed, Arendt concludes her On Revolution with an account of a French  resistance  fighter  who,  through  his  actions,  'found  himself',  before  finishing the  book  with  the  claim  that 'it  was  the polis ,  the  space  of  men's  free  deeds  and living words, which could endow life with splendour' (OR: 280-1). But it seems as if Arendt  has  already  forgotten  the  significance  of  the  resistance  fighter,  who  acts outside  of and  in opposition  to the official  'polis',  whose actions also,  or  even especially, endow life with splendour, with or without a plural public realm.\n\nIn any case, it is clear that Arendt wants not the Socratic moral standpoint but mores,  the  public  customs  of  ethical  life,  to  play  a  central  social  and  political  role during 'normal' times. Indeed, Arendt goes so far as to claim that 'those who under\n\nperfectly normal conditions appeal to high-flung moral standards are very much like those who take God's name in vain' (RJ: 105). However, in dark times of crises, such as  occurred  under  totalitarian  rule  (although  Taylor  (2002:  158)  argues  that  we should conceive of 'dark times' more broadly), Arendt wants an authentic morality of conscience, and not public mores, to play the central role. Times of crises are thus those times when our collective ethical life has gone astray  to the extent that it is mute violence and fear, and not the power generated through free  association and dialogue, that rules the day. However, due to the enormous gulf that Arendt places between morality and action (see Kateb, 2000: 130-44), Arendt's claim that morality should  come  into  play  politically only in  such  extreme  situations  is  not  a  viable solution as such times, if any do, call for the sort of action that conscience (as Arendt understands it) simply undermines. Arendt may have responded to such an objection by  arguing  that  the  role  of  conscience  and  thinking  is  only  as  a  precursor  to judgment, and it is judgment that leads to action. But in the ethically barren isolation from others and the world which defines times of crises, judgment can find no firm ground, lacking as it is in access to the publically expressed free opinions of others. Stuck  in  the  isolation  of  the  moral  standpoint,  judgment  remains  perpetually undermined  by  the  destructive  power  of  critical  thinking. As  such,  either  Arendt's account  of  conscience,  or  the  role  she  affords  it,  is  not  viable.  Or  perhaps  both -conscience  has  a  rebuilding  function  which  Arendt  ignores,  and  conscience  can sometimes issue positive imperatives to act, especially in times of crises.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nArendt  understands  Eichmann 's thoughtlessness  to  be  the  norm  in  modern  mass societies. The masses , on Arendt's story, are so alienated and thoughtless that they will  blindly  follow  any  set  of  mores,  no  matter  how  irrational  or  violent.  This  claim seems too strong. Norms that garner widespread support almost always have some firmer basis than the mere thoughtless desire of the many to comply with the status quo. Even so, Aren dt's view that mass evil is perpetrated in large part by people who thoughtlessly cooperate, and have no intention of being either good or evil, remains a valid insight. The critical thinker does not make the moral mistake of the masses in acting as if it is business as usual during times of crises when mores completely lose their  ethical  character.  The  critical  thinker  also  rejects  the  ethical  arrogance  of  the professional thinker whenever opportunities exist for building power, through dialogue and free association, from  which action and representative judgments can  emerge. But  in  such  times  of  crises  conscience  can  (perhaps)  be  a  more  powerful  positive force  for  action  than Arendt's  purely  destructive  account  of  critical  thinking  and\n\nnegative  account  of  conscience  can  allow  for.  Sometimes  critical  thinking  can underwrite  and  not  just  undermine  action,  especially  when  the  moral  stakes  are down.\n\n## Reference List\n\nAllen,  Amy.  \"Power,  Subjectivity,  and  Agency:  Between  Arendt  and  Foucault.\" International Journal of Philosophical Studies 10, no. 2 (2002): 131-49.\n\nArendt, Hannah. \"History of Political Theory.\" In The Library of Congress, The Hannah Arendt Papers , 1955.\n\nAristotle.  \"Ethica  Nicomachea.\"  In The  Basic  Works  of  Aristotle ,  Edited  by  Richard McKeon  and  Translated  W.
