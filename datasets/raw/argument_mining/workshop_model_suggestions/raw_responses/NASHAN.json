But is it possible that the infl  uence was bi-  directional - that hermeneutics was not only infl  uenced by natural history but that it also infl  uenced certain aspects of the study of nature, leading to new insights and discoveries? Could the study of nature in the late eighteenth century have involved hermeneutic methods and insights that ultimately transformed the ways in which we approach and represent the natural world?\n\nTo  answer  this  question,  I  will  consider  the  relationship between hermeneutics and natural science in the eighteenth century, focusing on three fi  gures, Buffon, Diderot, and Herder. Though Kant has  been  recognized  as  developing  something  like  a  hermeneutics of nature in the Critique of the Power of Judgment (1790) - through refl  ective  judging  and  the  idea  of  life 11 -  these  thinkers  developed the notion of an interpretation of nature well before Kant (such that many of Kant's key claims are already present in their work), and they were able to integrate the hermeneutic method into their study of nature more coherently than Kant ever did or was able to do. 12  After all, unlike Buffon, Diderot, and Herder, Kant remained wedded to the idea of science as founded on mathematics, 13  such that he could not agree with the 'liberalization' of science that took place in the mideighteenth century, which led to the introduction of new modes of knowledge into scientifi  c research. 14  My claim then is that the emergence of a hermeneutics of nature must be understood in light of this liberalization of science, heralded by Buffon, designated by Diderot, and carried out most comprehensively by Herder. As I will argue,\n\n3\n\nit was Herder's new methodology - developed for the interpretation of  historical  texts  and  authors  -  that  furnished  the  most  concrete response to a key problem facing both Buffon and Diderot and that offered signifi  cant insights that resulted in the development of a new, dynamic natural history and geography. 15\n\n## THE EIGHTEENTH-  CENTURY LANDSCAPE\n\nIn 1735 Linnaeus placed the human being in the class 'quadruped' and created the anthropomorphic order, which included monkeys, lizards, and sloths. The reasoning for this was that they all shared the  same  arrangement  of  teeth.  Buffon,  among  others,  considered this to be both arbitrary and far too narrow a way by which to draw classifi  cations.  Linnaeus's  classifi  cation,  he  argues  in  the Histoire naturelle (1749-1804), is based on 'a metaphysical error.' He writes:\n\nit is easy to see that the great fault in all of this is a metaphysical error … in wanting to judge a whole by only one of its parts: a very obvious error, and one that is surprisingly found everywhere; for almost all of the classifi  ers have employed only one part, such as teeth, claws, or talons, to classify animals, and leaves or fl  owers to categorize plants, instead of using all of the parts, looking for the differences and similarities in the entire individual thing. 16\n\nBy confusedly taking the part for the whole, by narrowly focusing on one aspect of an animal's or plant's structure without taking account of the 'entire individual thing,' Linnaeus's system imposed abstract categories onto nature, which had little or nothing to do with nature itself. Thus Buffon contends, 'that way of knowing is not a science, it is only a convention, an arbitrary language.' 17\n\nIn light of his critique of abstraction and convention, Buffon introduced the distinction between 'physical' and 'abstract' truth. One kind of abstract truth, he argued, is mathematical truth, insofar as it is an invention of the human mind. Physical truths, by contrast,\n\n4\n\nare real; they exist in the natural world and are the proper object of human inquiry.  18\n\nBuffon's emphasis on real or physical truths led him to a new, historicized conception of species and of nature more generally. In the place of Linnaeus's arbitrary classifi  cations, Buffon argued that natural history must be concerned with 'real' relations, which can only be discerned through historical insight. Thus, he writes,\n\n[natural] history must follow description, and must solely center around the relations which natural things have among themselves and with us: the history of an animal must not be the history of the individual, but that of the whole species; it must treat their generation … the number of their young, the care of their parents … their place of habitation, their food … and fi  nally the services they can render us. 19\n\nIn  other  words,  in  order  to  overcome  the  abstract  systems  of  taxonomy, it is necessary to reconceive natural history: natural history must consider a species in relation to its context, and, most importantly,  regard  it  not  as  a  static  (eternal)  entity,  but  as  the  continuation of a group of individuals (in time) through reproduction. 20 In one stroke, Buffon offered a new defi  nition of species, historicized nature, and redefi  ned natural history.\n\nIn  the Histoire  naturelle Buffon  identifi  ed  a  difficulty  with his  approach,  one  that  has  to  do  with  the  difference  between  the way in which our intellect operates and the way in which nature operates.  Our  intellect  proceeds  linearly,  taking  only  single  steps in  one  direction.  Nature, by contrast, 'does not take a single step except to go in all directions; in marching forward, she extends to the sides and above.' 21  With this apparent incongruity between the mind and nature, the question arises as to how it is possible to glean any unity in nature's infi  nite multiplicity. Lacking a priori theoretical foundations, it is not evident how natural history can capture nature's diversity in a coherent or meaningful way.\n\n4\n\nIt was precisely this question that Diderot posed in his Pensées sur l'interprétation de la Nature (1753/  1754 22   ). Like Buffon, Diderot was deeply critical of the mathematical and a priorist methodologies of his predecessors, writing that 'the domain of mathematicians is a  world  purely  of  the  intellect,  where  what  are  taken  for  absolute truths cease entirely to be so when applied to the world we live in.' 23 Nonetheless,  Diderot  notes  that  lacking  mathematical  or  a  priori foundations, it appears impossible to achieve unity in natural history,  such  that  '[e]  ven  if  experimental  science  continued  to  work for century after century, the materials which it accumulated would eventually  have  become  too  great  to  fi  t  into  any  system,  and  the inventory of them would still be far from complete.' 24\n\nFor Buffon and Diderot the solution to this dilemma is found in  analogy  and  comparative  analysis. 25   Thus  Buffon  writes  in  the Histoire naturelle :\n\nThis goal is the most important one … to combine observations, to generalize about facts, to tie them together by the force of analogy [ par la force de l'analogie ], and to try to arrive at this high degree of knowledge where we can judge that particular effects depend on more general effects, where we can compare nature with herself in her great operations, and from where we can fi  nally open up the paths that will permit us to perfect the different parts of physics. 26\n\nNatural  history  requires  analogy  because  it  is  only  through  comparing various structures that we can begin to discern similarities and recognize differences between species. Thus in his account of anatomy, Buffon notes that it was not until anatomists began to compare  human and animal bodies that any knowledge was achieved. For, he explains, 'What real knowledge can be derived from a single object? Is not every science founded on the comparison of similar and different objects, of their analogous or opposite properties, and of all their relative qualities? Absolute knowledge, if it has an existence,\n\n4\n\nexceeds the powers of man: we can only judge by the relations of things.' 27\n\nBy discerning similarities and differences, analogy provides a means by which to grasp continuity in nature   - real relations - that are  not  based  on  just  one  structural  similarity,  or  an  a  priori  taxonomy. Such an analogically   based account of nature differs, however, from a systematic account founded on mathematical construction or axiomatic demonstration. For one, it necessarily remains open to being corrected - analogical inference may be wrong. Furthermore, it cannot establish certainty   - analogical inference achieves probability only. 28\n\nThe road to the 'interpretation of nature,' as Diderot put it, was  opened.  The  use  of  analogy  implied  that  the  study  of  nature could not yield certain, eternal knowledge, but it also implied that natural  history  was  not  and  cannot  be  the  mere  accumulation  of disconnected facts. Rather, natural history must involve observation guided by a literary tool - analogy - in order to discern similarity and difference. In other words, the way to resolve Diderot's problem was to invoke a literary device in order to 'interpret' nature. The natural scientist, as John Zammito has noted, became more than an observateur of nature (Bacon); she was now an interprète of nature. 29 In the Pensées , however, Diderot did not provide a detailed account of the methodology of the interpretation of nature. Though Buffon provided insights into overcoming this difficulty, he too did not furnish a comprehensive methodology. It was Herder who, through his new methodology of hermeneutics, provided the fi  rst comprehensive 'interpretation of nature.'\n\n## HERDER AND BUFFON\n\nHerder was familiar with Buffon, and makes ample reference to him throughout his writings. 30  He was, furthermore, sympathetic to many of Buffon's ideas: Buffon's critique of a priorism and mathematicaluniversalist accounts of nature; his claim that human history must be considered part of natural history; and his critique of abstraction\n\n4\n\nin science. However, Herder's attitude toward Buffon was, as John Zammito notes, mixed.  31   Herder  worries  that  Buffon  was  not  able to achieve his aims, because he remained tied to the prejudices of his age. For although Buffon sought to develop a concrete, holistic account of the natural world - an account that is not focused on one aspect of an organism's structure - his tendency was to analyze and distinguish, rather than synthesize and unify.\n\nIn his study of Thomas Abbt, Herder distinguishes Buffon as the  anti-  systematic  thinker  who  is  needed  to  combat  the  likes  of Linnaeus in the study of the human spirit. Thus, he writes, 'when our  systematic  philosophers  become Linnaeus in  the  study  of  the mind,  classifying  according  to  their  own  principles  [ eigensinnig ], then an unsystematic mind, like Buffon ,  must be placed alongside them … in order to analyze the individuals' (FHA 2, 572). 32\n\nWhile  this  statement  appears  sympathetic,  it  also  harbors Herder's worry about Buffon, namely Buffon's apparent tendency to dissect and analyze without fi  nding a way by which to synthesize. This worry is clearly expressed in Herder's 1772 prize essay on the origin of language, where he places Buffon alongside Condillac and Bonnet, and criticizes all three for their failure to unify what they have dissected. Herder writes: 'All dissections of sensation in the case of Buffon's, Condillac's , and Bonnet's sensing human being are abstractions; the philosopher has to neglect one thread of sensation in  pursuing  the  other,  but  in  nature  all  these  threads  are  a  single web!' (HPW 107).  33  Although Herder is here specifi  cally concerned with their respective accounts of human psychology and physiology, his critique obtains for what he sees as a general tendency in Buffon's approach. Though Buffon intends to  offer a holistic account of the natural world, his efforts are not fully realized. This can be seen in Buffon's account of 'climate,' and in Herder's transformation of this (somewhat superfi  cial) conception into a key methodological tool for natural history (and ultimately geography  ).\n\nBuffon  introduces  the  notion  of  climate,  alongside  nourishment, in order to account for differences among animal species and\n\n4\n\namong humans.  34  By climate, Buffon implies primarily temperature but also geography. 35  Speaking of horses, he remarks that 'studs kept in dry light soils produce active, nimble, and vigorous horses, with nervous limbs and strong hoofs; while those kept in moist ground, and  in  too  rich  pasturage,  have  generally  large  heavy  heads,  gross bodies, thick legs, bad hoofs, and broad feet. It is easy to perceive,' Buffon concludes, 'that these differences proceed from the varieties in climate and food.' 36\n\nClimate  and  nourishment  are  thus  regarded  as  the  ultimate causes of differences within species. This is evident, for instance, in Buffon's claim that variation in human skin color is due to, on the one hand, the climatic zone a human inhabits, and, on the other, the infl  uence of food. 37  In contrast to Buffon's two categories, Herder contends that 'it is much more the case that a large storehouse of other forces, both disadvantageous and advantageous, are connected to us' (FHA 6, 265). Though Herder does not specifi  cally point to Buffon here, this statement resounds with his earlier critique of Buffon's tendency to dissect. The claim is that Buffon   - despite his efforts - was unable to follow nature's many directions, along a non-  linear path, and fi  nd unity therein. In his emphasis on just two categories, Buffon remains one-  sided in his analysis; he does not account for the complexity and multi-  directionality of nature's (many) 'forces.' 38\n\nIn  contrast  to  Buffon's  climate  and  nourishment,  Herder develops the notion of a 'world' or a 'circle,' which aims to recognize and encompass multiple essential aspects of a natural (and cultural) environment, the relations between these aspects, the ways in  which these aspects refl  ect  and  are  refl  ected  in  individuals  and species,  and  most  importantly,  the  ways  in  which  these  various aspects  form  an  integrated  unity.  Working  with  analogies,  Herder, like Buffon, aims to discern similarities among the multiplicity of natural phenomena. However, through the notion of a world, Herder extends his use of analogy beyond a one-  to-  one comparison (i.e., comparing the structure of one species or variety to another in light of a specifi  c natural phenomenon, such as heat). For, as we shall see,\n\n4\n\nthe  idea  of  a  world  implies  a  multiplicity  of  factors  -  a  'chaos  of causes and effects' (FHA 6, 266) - and their co-  determination. Herder invokes the notion of a world in order to follow nature's many paths and discern unity in the multiplicity. How does Herder arrive at this idea  of  a  world,  and  how  does  he  apply  it  to  resolve  Buffon's  and Diderot's dilemma? I will begin with the fi  rst question, and argue that although Herder introduces the notion of a world in the prize essay on language, it was in his preceding writings on the interpretation of historical individuals and texts that he developed the idea.\n\n## HERDER'S HERMENEUTICS\n\nHerder's  hermeneutics,  like  Buffon's  methodology,  is  critical  of a priori theories of interpretation. In their place Herder develops a theory  of  interpretation  that  employs  a  bottom-  up  approach  that seeks to grasp the particularity of a culture, and understand it from within (FHA 1, 97). As he puts it in This Too a Philosophy of History (1774), 'every nation has its own center of well-  being with itself, just as every globe has it center of gravity' and the task of the interpreter is to grasp precisely this center (FHA 4, 39). The question thus is: how is an interpreter to grasp the 'center' of a culture long gone, or discern the 'center' of a text or work of art? What, in other words, are the methods that the historian or interpreter must invoke in order to achieve this kind of knowledge?\n\nWell before his writings on the philosophy of history, Herder had begun to consider these questions in relation to biography and the  interpretation  of  works  of  art.  In  the  essay  on  Thomas  Abbt, Herder's  concern  is  with  how  he  -  as  the  biographer  of  Abbt  -  is to approach his subject in the right way. For Herder the right way involves recognizing both Abbt's individuality and his indebtedness to his time and culture. As Herder puts it, 'most of all it is necessary to distill [ abzieht ] what belongs to the author's time or to the past world , and what he leaves over for the world of posterity . He bears the chains of his age, to which he offers his book as a gift; he stands in  his  century  like  a  tree  in  the  realm  of  earth  into  which  it  has\n\n4\n\ndriven its roots, from which it draws nourishing juices, with which it covers its originating members' (FHA 2, 579; HPW 172, translation modifi  ed). The natural imagery serves to elaborate Herder's point: an author, like a tree, is not born isolated; rather, both are dependent on the surroundings, the climate and the geography, into which they are born. They become what they are only in relation to this larger context. The aim of the interpreter (like the natural historian) must therefore be to discern the individuality or distinctness of an author (of  a  species) within her  culture  (within the natural environment), and not beyond or above it. Thus, Herder continues, whoever wishes to rob the author of the 'birthmarks of his time,' risks 'taking from him the traits of his individuality [ Eigenheiten ]' (FHA 2, 579; HPW 172). An author neither exists nor can be understood outside of her or his cultural framework; it is this framework that enables the author to write, to become an author. The framework, then, is not something  artifi  cially  imposed,  nor  is  it  a  hindrance  to  understanding; rather, it must be taken into account in order to discern the author's distinctive contribution or individuality.\n\nThis means that the interpreter must, fi  rst, avoid any a priori generalizations about the author or the work: given that the author is born in a specifi  c time and place, one cannot make any presumptions about her work or aims without fi  rst investigating the particularities into which she is born. The interpreter must, however, also avoid sinking into particularities and failing to fi  nd  a  'center,'  a  meaningful and coherent unity in light of which the author's work is to be interpreted. Thus, just like the historian of nature, so the interpreter  must  avoid  both  abstraction  and  the  mere  accumulation  of data; the interpreter must fi  nd a way to grasp the particular and fi  nd signifi  cance,  coherence therein .  This  means,  importantly,  that  the interpreter's aim is not to regard the author as a mere refl  ection of the mores of her time and place; rather, by seeking to discern the author's  individuality  within  her  context,  the  interpreter's  aim  is to  discern  how  the  author  is  a  participant  in  and  a  contributor  to her context. As such, Herder's conception of unity (context) is not\n\n4\n\nof  an  undifferentiated  or  homogenous  whole,  but  of  an  internally differentiated  one,  composed of the individual contributions of its various  members,  whose  contributions  are  themselves  dependent on this unity, this context. There is, in other words, a reciprocity at  work  here,  such  that  neither  the  whole  nor  the  parts  can  exist without the other.\n\nIn the essay on Abbt, Herder explains that the means by which to achieve the goal of interpretation is by explaining 'one in terms of the other [ eins aus dem andern erkläret ],' i.e., by seeing how the context  is  refl  ected  in  the  individual  author's  work,  and  how  the individual author's work adds to, or challenges aspects of, this context  (FHA  2,  575;  HPW  171).  It  is  only  by  seeing  one  (the  author) through  the  other  (her  age)  that  their  similarities  and  differences come to  light. 39   In  this  way,  Herder  extends  analogical  refl  ection, beyond a one-  on-  one comparison, to encompass the world that the author inhabits and which inhabits the author (the relation, as we have seen, is reciprocal). This extension is demonstrated in Herder's own hermeneutic practice, and can be seen, for instance, in his essay on Shakespeare (1773; draft 1771).\n\nIn the essay, Herder challenges French views of theater, which take  Aristotle's  understanding  of  tragedy  as  foundational  for  aesthetic judgment, in order to demonstrate their mistaken interpretation of Shakespeare. The trouble with the French approach, Herder notes, is that it fails to recognize that the world out of which Greek tragedy  emerged  fundamentally  differs  from  Shakespeare's  world. 'In Greece,' Herder contends, 'the drama developed in a way that it could not in the north. In Greece it was what it can never be in the north. In the north it is not and cannot be what it was in Greece' (FHA 2, 499; SWA 292).  40  After all, he continues, 'as everything in the world changes, so Nature, the true creator of Greek drama, was bound to change also. The Greek worldview, manners, the state of the republics, the tradition of the heroic age, religion, even music, expression, and the degrees of illusion changed' (FHA 2, 503; SWA 294).  Thus,  to  judge  Shakespeare  according  to  the  rules  of  Greek\n\n4\n\ndrama is not only problematic, but also absurd. A work of art is, like a writer, of its time, such that its appropriateness, its 'genius,' can only be measured and determined in relation to its time.\n\nHerder begins his interpretation of Shakespeare by noting general  differences  between  ancient  Greek  drama  and  Shakespeare's, differences  that  are  fundamentally  connected  to  their  respective worldviews. In ancient Greece there was an overarching sense of unity of time and place, as well as a sense of simplicity among the Greek people and their polity. One can say that the Greeks lacked a  modern  sense  of  history  and  of  cultural  differences.  This  was, Herder contends, refl  ected in their dramatic works (most, though not  all,  of  Greek  drama  occurred  in  one  place,  for  instance).  By contrast,  Shakespeare's  world  is  one  composed  of  'a  rich  variety of different estates, ways of life, convictions, peoples and idioms any nostalgia for the simplicity of former times would have been in vain' (FHA 2, 508; SWA 298). For this reason his works do not occur in one place, but move from one location to the next, and involve  people  from  a  variety  of  backgrounds.  It  is  also  for  this reason, Herder continues, that for Shakespeare plot no longer held the meaning the Greeks had bestowed upon it (i.e., a single action), but  came  to  mean  'event  '  or  'great  occurrence.'  Ultimately,  in Shakespeare's works we witness transitions and movements that are simply not present in Greek drama, and this is a refl  ection of the world that Shakespeare inhabits.\n\nFurthermore,  Herder  notes  that  ancient  Greek  drama  was  a public institution and a religious event, while Shakespearean drama did not have religious motivations (FHA 2, 516; SWA 304; see also SW 16, 101). 41   This means that the aim of  a  Greek  drama differed from that of a Shakespearean drama, and it is only in light of this difference of aim that either can be properly appreciated and understood. Shakespeare's tragedies, for instance, include comedy - a fact that challenges the distinction between tragedy and comedy that has been upheld since Aristotle (FHA 2, 525). However, given that the aims of Shakespeare's drama differ from those of Greek tragedy, there\n\n4\n\nis no reason to abide by the Aristotelian understanding of tragedy in order to judge Shakespeare's work.\n\nA  further  important  difference  between  Greek  tragedy  and Shakespearean drama is the origin of their dramatic form, the source from  which  they  drew  their  inspiration.  While  the  Greeks  drew on the dithyramb, mimed dance and the chorus (FHA 2, 500; SWA 292; see also SW 16, 100), Shakespeare drew on history (FHA 2, 508; SWA 298; see also FHA 2, 525; see also SW 16, 101). For this reason, Shakespeare's plays are themselves a presentation of history. Thus, Herder writes, 'in Othello,' we have before us a ' living history of the genesis, development, eruption, and sad end to the passion of this noble and unfortunate man !' (FHA 2, 511; SWA 300). The Greek tragedian was, by contrast, no historian, and his genius did not lie in his ability to draw on historical events. For this reason, Herder argues that the origin or inspiration of a work of art must be taken into account when we judge its value. In other words, genius must be measured differently - Shakespeare's genius is a different kind than the one exhibited by the Greek tragedian. 42\n\nWhat then is the genius of Shakespeare? According to Herder, it  is  not  unlike  the  genius  of  a  historian.  For  it  has  to  do  with Shakespeare's  ability  to  assemble  the  various  characters,  estates, and ways of life into a meaningful whole. Shakespeare 'embraces a hundred scenes of a world event in his arms, orders them with a gaze, and breathes into them the one soul that suffuses and animates everything,'  Herder  writes,  echoing  not  only  the  aim  of  the  historian but also that of the natural historian (FHA 2, 511; SWA 300). As  Buffon  put  it  in  the Premier  Discours ,  'one  can  say  that  the love and study of nature presuppose in the spirit of the investigator two qualities that are opposed: the grand view of an ardent genius, who embraces everything in one glance [ embrasse tout d'un coup d'oeil ], and the detailed attention of a laborious instinct that does not attach itself to any one point.' 43   Shakespeare's genius lies in this two-  fold ability, of noting every detail and ordering them with one glance.\n\n5\n\nWhile contemporaries may have been similarly inspired by the emerging historical consciousness and the increasingly differentiated world they inhabited, Shakespeare was able to present this  multivalent  world  on  stage  in  a coherent way.  Thus  despite  the  highly differentiated set of characters, locations, and events, Shakespeare's dramas display a unity, and it is in this that Shakespeare's genius lies. Herder thus locates Shakespeare's genius in relation to his time and place. Shakespeare's distinctiveness is not sought in either an a priori criterion  (for  instance,  one  that  accords  with  Aristotle's  account of  tragedy  ),  nor  is  it  sought  in  a  merely  particularizing  account  of Shakespeare, i.e., in a character sketch or vignette, that fails to place Shakespeare in his time, and thus fails to see where his genius lies. The fi  rst approach (the approach assumed by the French) moves from the universal or a priori to the particular. In so doing, it overlooks or denies the particularity of the particular. The second approach, by contrast, focuses entirely on the particular, and thus fails to rise above the particular. Though the two approaches seem opposed, they share one important commonality: neither is able to mediate between the universal and the particular - neither is able to 'embrace a hundred scenes' and 'order them with a gaze.' 44\n\nHerder's wording is telling here; as with Buffon, the emphasis is on both multiplicity and unity, on a hundred scenes and one gaze [ mit dem Blick ].  The  implication is that the interpreter of a work of literature must proceed by reading each part after the other, i.e., linearly. The work, however, extends in many directions: each of its parts is in dialogue not only with the part that preceded it or the one that comes after it, but also with the opening as well as with the closing acts, for instance; the same holds for the characters, whose relations are not limited to those characters with whom they appear, etc.  Thus  although  the  reader  proceeds  sequentially,  the  meaning of the work, and the signifi  cance of each scene, cannot be grasped simply through a sequential reading. At the end of the reading, the interpreter  realizes  what  unifi  es  the  various  parts  (which  is  not simply  their  sequential  ordering),  and  must  go  back  and  consider\n\n5\n\nevery scene, every act, and every character's words, in light of this unity. The reader must, in other words, re-  present the parts, which are apprehended sequentially, non-  sequentially, i.e., as partaking in and contributing to a multi-  directional and meaningful whole. The reader must therefore fi  nd in the sequence a non-  sequential unity, a unity that is not determined by the way in which we apprehend the work (or nature), but that nonetheless determines each part of the sequence. Of course, the work of interpretation is never completed. The reader must continue to move back and forth between the parts, and revisit her interpretation in light of a deeper understanding of the connections between the various parts, and of the ways in which they portray the whole from a different angle.\n\nThis hermeneutic circle, which Herder develops in his essays on literary and artistic interpretation, is, I believe, the basis for his parallel notion of a 'circle' or a 'world' that he introduces in his essay on language in order to explicate differences between animals, and between animals and humans, and that he goes on to invoke in the Ideen in  order  to  explicate  the  relations  between  species,  and between species and their natural environment.\n\n## HERDER'S NOTION OF A CIRCLE OR WORLD\n\nHerder's notions of a circle or a world may have been inspired by Buffon's  notion  of  'climate.' 45   In  contrast  to  climate,  however, Herder's  understanding  of  a  circle  takes  account  not  only  of  temperature and geography, but also of the ways in which an animal (or a human) refl  ects and is refl  ected in its (his or her) world. A circle, for Herder, is not simply an external cause that effects the development of a species, but an inhabited world, which must be understood in relation to its inhabitants and vice versa. Every essential aspect of a world must be taken into account, because through understanding this world, we understand its inhabitants, and through understanding its inhabitants, we understand it. Herder's 'world,' like the world of an author, does not simply affect its inhabitants (i.e., the author), but is also infl  uenced by them. Put differently, a world does not have a\n\n5\n\nsolely uni-  directional impact, but is a complex reality that refl  ects its inhabitants as much as it is refl  ected in them.\n\nAs noted, Herder fi  rst articulated his notion of a 'circle' or a 'world' in his essay on the origin of language and thus in response to the question posed by the Berlin Academy. Herder's aim in the essay was to develop a naturalistic account of the origin of language that resolved the difficulties faced by the naturalist positions of Condillac and Rousseau. It was Rousseau who fi  rst articulated these difficulties.  In  his Discourse  on  the  Origin  of  Inequality ,  he  noted  that while human languages are artifi  cial, and involve a certain amount of arbitrariness and convention, natural (i.e., animal) language does not. 46  Yet, if human language emerged from natural language, then, Rousseau surmised,  it  is  necessary  to  explain  this  transition,  this jump from the one to the other. Lacking any such explanation, it was not evident how a naturalistic account could be sustained. 47  Herder responds to this difficulty by following a different path than the one taken by Rousseau  .\n\nRather than conjecturing an imagined past (as Rousseau had done), Herder begins by observing and describing what is before him, 48 with the aim of answering the question: what is it like to be human, and what might it be like to be animal? The fi  rst striking characteristic of the human being, he notes, is the fact that the human is 'far inferior to the animals in strength and sureness of instinct, indeed … he … lacks what in the case of so many animal species we call innate abilities for and drives to art [ Kunsttriebe ]' (FHA 1, 711; HPW 77-  8). Animals, by contrast, are born with specifi  c strengths and capacities, which refl  ect and are refl  ected in their natural environment. There is an intimate reciprocity between the animal and its context, such that its abilities map onto what Herder calls the animal's 'circle [ Kreis ].' He writes: ' Each animal has its circle to which it belongs from birth, into which it immediately enters, in which it remains all its life and in which it dies.' This circle corresponds to the animal's inborn capacities: 'the sharper the animals' senses are, and the more marvelous the products of their art, then the smaller their circle is, the more\n\n5\n\nlimited in kind the product of their art' (FHA 1, 712; HPW 78). There is an inverse proportion between the animal's capacities (its 'drives and arts') and its circle: the larger the circle, the less defi  ned, the less focused and distinct the capacities; the smaller the circle, the more defi  ned and focused the capacities. This is evident in the case of bees, for instance, whose circle is the beehive; within the beehive, their 'drives and arts' are a display of precision and efficiency. Once the bees exit the beehive, however, their distinctive and focused capacities, which are perfectly suited for the beehive, place them in a precarious position. Their capacities, so attuned to the beehive, are inversely unfi  t for the non-  beehive environment. The same, Herder notes, obtains for other insects, such as the spider, whose 'world' is its web, and whose capacities are perfectly attuned to this world - but hardly beyond it.\n\nWhen considering those beings whose 'circle' is much wider, the opposite appears to be the case. In contrast to bees and spiders, animals that roam, for instance, are far less focused, their capacities are not as clearly determined for or by their very specifi  c context. This leads to a general decrease in the power and efficiency of their senses in relation to their surroundings. As Herder puts it, 'on the other  hand,  ' the  more numerous the functions and the destiny of the animals are, the more dispersed their attention is over several objects, the less constant their manner of life is, in short, the larger and more diverse their sphere is, then the more we see their sensuousness distribute itself and weaken '  ' (FHA 1, 712; HPW 78). This dispersion of attention and weakening of the senses is most clear, Herder continues, in the case of the human, who lacks a circle or specifi  c context altogether. The human being does not live in any one environment,  but  can  inhabit  a  multitude  of  geographic  contexts, and this is connected to the fact that human capacities are far less focused and not at all shaped or molded by needs that are specifi  cally relevant to a particular context, or a particular function. Thus Herder goes on, 'The human being has no such uniform and narrow sphere where only a single sort of work awaits him; a world of occupations\n\n5\n\nand destinies surrounds him.' For this reason, 'His senses and organization are not sharpened for a single thing; he has senses for everything and hence naturally for each particular thing weaker and duller senses' (FHA 1, 713; HPW 79).\n\nThe difference between humans and animals, then, has to do with the human lack of a specifi  c circle, and with what that entails in terms of innate capacities. In contrast to animals, humans lack 'direction,' which means that the human being has ' no drive to art, no skill for art - and, one thing which is more especially relevant here, no animal language .' In other words, the human being, in contrast to  animals, is  not  born  with  innate  capacities  that  fi  t  its  environmental needs; the human being, one can say, suffers from a poverty of innate skills, one of which is animal language. Thus while animals certainly have language, as Herder notes, their language is something with  which  they  are  born;  it  is  an  instinct.  By  contrast,  humans lack innate skills, including animal language. This is the real difference, according to Herder, between humans and animals, and it is the reason why human language differs from animal language. The former is not instinctual; it must be acquired, or as Herder puts it 'invented' (FHA 1, 722; HPW 87).\n\nBy focusing on context, and seeing the animal and the human in relation to its context, Herder is able to maintain a naturalistic account of language, that is, an account that does not rely on divine origins,  without,  however,  succumbing to the difficulties  faced  by Condillac's  and  Rousseau's  positions.  By  invoking  the  notion  of  a circle or a world, and seeking to understand the individual animal in  relation  to  its  world,  to  its  lived  environment,  Herder  is  doing nothing less than 'explaining the one through the other,' i.e., seeing how the context is refl  ected in the individual animal and, in turn, how  the  individual  animal  contributes  to  its  context.  By  moving back and forth between the animal and its circle, Herder discerns an indelible unity and reciprocity between the two, and, in this way, begins to recognize important differences between various animals and between humans and animals. These differences are not based on\n\n5\n\nan a priori account, or a general perspective, nor are they based on the mere accumulation of data. Rather, the differences emerge through hermeneutic work, through seeing the parts in their relation to the whole and, in turn, seeing how the whole is manifest in the parts. By relying on this methodology, Herder does not need to offer a conjectural history of humanity, nor does he need to account for a 'jump' from  natural  to  artifi  cial  language.  Rather,  Herder's  methodology allows him to focus on what is before him, and locate meaning   an indelible unity or reciprocity - in and through what he sees.\n\nWhile Herder's introduction of the notion of a world provides a solution to the question concerning the origin of language, its signifi  cance goes beyond the 1772 essay. Herder invokes the notion of a world in the Ideen , where he seeks to develop a natural history of humanity, which commences with a natural history of non-  human nature. In seeking to understand the structure of birds, for instance, he does not focus on one aspect of its structure, nor does he get lost in its various aspects. Instead, he focuses on the relation between the structure of the bird and its environment, its world. 'The bird fl  ies in the air,' such that 'every divergence of its form from the build of land  animals  can  be  explicated  through  its  element.'  By  contrast, 'The fi  sh swims in water; its feet and hands are grown into fi  n and tail: it has only little articulation of its members' (FHA 6, 75-  6).\n\nJust as in the language essay, so here Herder sees an integral connection  between  the  animal  and  its  environment.  The  relation  is,  importantly,  not  merely  superfi  cial.  Herder's  point  is  that the animal's very structure ,  its  build  [ Bau ],  is  in  dialogue  with  its environment, such that this structure both serves its environmental needs and is served by its environment (FHA 6, 73). Furthermore, for  Herder,  recognizing  the  ways  in  which  the  bird  is  in  dialogue with its context, and comparing it to fi  sh and terrestrial animals, is an important means by which to discern how the bird both differs from and reiterates the structure of other animals. In other words, by grasping the bird in its environment, and comparing the relation between its structure and environment to that of the fi  sh and other\n\n5\n\nanimals,  one  begins  to  understand  not  only  the  bird's  relation  to its  environment, but also the bird's relation to other animals, and thereby discern both their differences and similarities, and thus glean a continuity in nature that does not imply identity.\n\n## CONCLUSION: HERDER'S HERMENEUTICS OF NATURE AND ITS IMPACT\n\nHerder has been credited with providing a more 'dynamic' view of nature, a view that ultimately led to the foundation of geography as a discipline in the nineteenth century. 49  Such a dynamic perspective implies, above all, a relation of reciprocal determination between the natural world and its inhabitants. While this perspective was most comprehensively carried out by Alexander von Humboldt, my claim is that Herder's notion of a world - developed through his hermeneutic theory and practice - played an essential role in the development of dynamic natural history. It is thus not surprising to recognize a fundamental affinity between Herder and Humboldt's aims. 50  What distinguishes Herder and Humboldt from their predecessors is their disinterest in classifi  cation, and by contrast, their interest in grasping a  'world,'  an  inhabited  reality  that  is  refl  ected  in  the  very  structure of its inhabitants. This enabled both of them to move beyond superfi  cial  descriptions  of  climatic  infl  uence  to  the  view  that  the natural world is an effecting and effected reality, transforming and transformed  by  its  inhabitants.  Or,  to  conclude  with  Humboldt's own words:\n\nI was passionately devoted to botany, and certain parts of zoology, and I fl  attered myself that our investigations might add some new species to those which have been already described; but preferring the connection of facts which have been long observed to the knowledge of insulated facts, although they were new, the discovery of an unknown genus seemed to me far less interesting than the observation of the geographical relations of the vegetable world, or the migration of social plants, and the limit of the\n\n5\n\nheight which their different tribes attain on the fl  anks of the Cordilleras. 51\n\n## Notes\n\n- 1 This is evident, for instance, in the recent special issue of the history of science journal Isis which focuses on the infl  uence of the humanities on the development of the natural sciences  . Rens Bod and Julia Kursell, eds., 'The History of Humanities and the History of Science,' Isis 106 (2015): 337-40.\n- 2 In their article on the history of science and the history of philology, Lorraine Daston and Glenn W. Most disagree with 'current ways of conceptualizing the history of science and the history of the humanities,' which 'have imposed anachronistic divisions among the great regions of knowledge and thereby obscured commonalities that are deeper, broader, and more enduring than this or that case study about specifi  c instances of interaction, infl  uence or borrowing would suggest.' Lorraine Daston and Glenn W. Most, 'History of Science and History of Philologies,' Isis 106 (2015): 381-2.\n- 3 As Daston and Most put it: 'philological practices of grammatical analysis, collation and comparison of texts, glosses and commentaries, indices and tabulations, and perhaps most signifi  cant of all, detection and correction of all manner of inconsistencies in form and substance, were (and in some cases, still are) the foundation for many scientifi  c practices, especially in medicine and natural history.' Daston and Most, 'History of Science,' 384.\n- 4 Brian Ogilvie, for instance, argues that the work of comparing texts in the Renaissance infl  uenced the work of comparing fl  ora and fauna and developing taxonomies. Brian Ogilvie, The Science of Describing: Natural History in Renaissance Europe (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2006). Similar research has been undertaken to demonstrate the signifi  cance of note-  taking practices in philology and the emergence of 'fi  eld work' in natural history in the Early Modern Period. See Ann Blair, 'The Rise of Note-  taking in Early Modern Europe,' Intellectual History Review 20 (2010): 303-16.\n- 5 Not all eighteenth-  century scholarship on this topic is recent, though the majority is. Two exceptions are Peter Reill  's 1992 article on historical\n\n5\n\nthought in Germany and Great Britain, which offers a large brushstrokes account of the development of natural history, arguing that it must be understood in relation to the development of historical thought more generally. Peter Hanns Reill, 'Buffon and Historical Thought in Germany and Great Britain,' in Buffon 88 , ed. Jean Gayon (Paris: Vrin, 1992). Hans-  Dieter Irmscher  's 1984 article on Herder  's philosophy of history notes Herder  's use of biological metaphors to describe historical phenomena, but does not consider whether Herder  's methodology refl  ected insights gained from natural history. Hans-  Dietrich Irmscher, 'Grundfragen der Geschichtsphilosophie Herders bis 1774,' in Bückeburger Gespräche über Johann Gottfried Herder 1983 , ed. Brigitte Poschman (Rinteln: Bösendahl, 1984).\n\n- 6 This recent work strongly contrasts with earlier approaches to historicism  . See for instance, Friedrich Meinecke, Historism: The Rise of a New Historical Outlook , trans. J. E. Anderson (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1972 [1936]). Though in his 1992 article Peter Reill (see n. 5 above) emphasizes the mutual infl  uence of the natural and the human sciences  , his earlier book on historicism does not. Peter Hanns Reill, The German Enlightenment and the Rise of Historicism (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1975). For more recent work which at least acknowledges the role of the natural sciences in the development of historicism, see Frederick Beiser  , The German Historicist Tradition (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), 6-10 and John Zammito  , 'Philosophy of History: The German Tradition from Herder to Marx,' in The Cambridge History of Philosophy in the Nineteenth Century (1790-1870) , ed. Allen W. Wood and Songsuk Susan Hahn (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2012). Beiser  's changing perspective on the relation between historicism and natural science epitomizes these changing attitudes. While in a 2007 article he argues that there is a difference in kind between the methods of the historical and natural sciences, in his 2011 book on historicism, he notes that now he 'reject[s] this distinction.' The reasons are twofold. First, very few historicists regarded the methods of history as distinct from those of the natural sciences. And second, Beiser claims, 'historicism grew out of a naturalistic program in the Eighteenth Century,' namely the attempt to create a 'science of man' by applying Newtonian laws and methods to history (Beiser  , The German Historicist Tradition , 3, note 5, and 6).\n\n5\n\n- 7 Though one can argue that historicism and hermeneutics are very closely associated, maybe even identifi  able (as Gadamer claims), I follow Beiser who distinguishes the two because many historicists were not hermeneutic thinkers, and many hermeneutic thinkers did not aim to formulate a general theory of history (Schleiermacher, for instance). Beiser  , The German Historicist Tradition , 10. Furthermore, studies of historicism have generally not focused on the hermeneutic tradition, leading to this lacuna.\n- 8 See for instance Thomas M. Seebohm, Hermeneutics: Method and Methodology (Dodrecht: Kluwer, 2004).\n- 9 Gadamer is generally uninterested in examining scientifi  c practices  , and more interested in philosophizing about science more generally. Furthermore, his account of the emergence of hermeneutics is largely one-  sided, identifying, for instance, romantic hermeneutics with the 'aesthetic attitude,' which Gadamer rejects in favor of his own version of universal hermeneutics. Gadamer  's unreliable history of hermeneutics should thus not serve as a guide to its historical development. See Kristin Gjesdal  , Gadamer and the Legacy of German Idealism (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009). For an account of positivist and post-  positivist science, see John Zammito  , A Nice Derangement of Epistemes: Post-  Positivism in the Study of Science from Quine to Latour (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2004).\n- 10 Michael Forster  's chapter on Herder  's philosophy of language, which also considers Herder  's hermeneutics, is a case in point. Forster notes that for Herder there are deep and intrinsic methodological similarities between the interpretation of historical texts and scientifi  c research. Forster  's chapter does not, however, consider the ways in which Herder employs or develops scientifi  c methodology in light of his hermeneutics, or the extent to which Herder  's scientifi  c knowledge (and his sources) may have infl  uenced his hermeneutics. Rather, Forster simply emphasizes a methodological parallelism between the two.

Though Makkreel is mostly interested in\n\n6\n\n- the fi  rst part of the Critique of the Power of Judgment , he does claim that Kant's notion of teleological judgment is part and parcel of the larger hermeneutic/  interpretive work developed earlier in the book, making note, for instance, of the fact that for Kant the idea of life has a descriptive as opposed to explanatory role, which is what makes Kant's method pace Makkreel - hermeneutic.

Sergio Moravia, 'The Enlightenment and the Sciences of Man,' History of Science 18 (1980): 247-68. Stephen Gaukroger  's account of the 'collapse' of seventeenth-  century mechanicalmathematical philosophy demonstrates the reasons for this opening up of science  , and the ways in which various thinkers responded to this opening up (above all, through the proliferation of new scientifi  c disciplines and objects of study).

See also Herder  's critique of Winckelmann's assessment of ancient Egyptian and ancient Greek sculpture. According to Herder  , Winckelmann  's account fails to recognize a fundamental difference in the aims (and thereby in the genre) of Greek and Egyptian sculpture, precisely because it is divorced from the culture in which the respective sculptures emerged. As Forster notes, Winckelmann does not only fail in his interpretation of these works, but also in his valuation of them. Forster  , After Herder , 173-5.\n- 43 Buffon  , HN 1 (1749), 4.\n- 44 For a detailed account of how Herder  's hermeneutics mediates between these two (insufficient) approaches, see Kristin Gjesdal  , Herder's Hermeneutics: History, Poetry, Enlightenment (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2017).\n- 45 See Sauter, Herder und Buffon , 22-3.\n- 46 As Avi Lifschitz notes, Rousseau identifi  ed three main challenges with the naturalistic account, including the problem of how convention can be achieved without consent, which requires speech. See Avi Lifschitz, Language and Enlightenment: The Berlin Debates of the Eighteenth Century (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), esp. 78-80.\n- 47 As Lifschitz recounts, 'Rousseau's exasperation at the difficulties posed by the human invention of language became a focal point for conservative authors, from Beauzée to de Maistre,' and ultimately led to Süßmilch's argument for the divine origin of human language. Lifschitz, Language and Enlightenment , 79; see also 83-7.\n- 48 His intention is made explicit when he states that, unlike previous philosophers who have sought but failed to offer a causal explanation of various human and animal capacities, his aim will be to offer 'observations [ Bemerkungen ]' which can at least 'throw much light on the doctrine of the human soul' (FHA 1, 712; HPW 78).\n- 49 On the emergence of 'dynamic' natural history and its infl  uence on modern geography  , see Tang, The Geographic Imagination of Modernity ,   ch. 1  . Tang maintains that Herder was the fi  rst to contribute\n\n6\n\n- to the dynamization of natural history (108). Eugen Sauter similarly claims that Herder played an important role in the emergence of modern geography, above all through infl  uencing the geographer Carl Ritter. Sauter, Herder und Buffon , 88.\n- 50 Otto Heller, one of Humboldt's fi  rst biographers, describes the relation between Herder and Humboldt in the following way: 'What Herder had enthusiastically attempted in the 'Outlines of a philosophy of the history of mankind,' Humboldt wants to do scientifi  cally in 'Kosmos': to connect the development of the culture of the human race to its native soil.' Quoted in Nicolaas A. Rupke, Alexander von Humboldt: A Metabiography (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2008), 71. Hanno Beck  , another Humboldt biographer, contends that the title of Humboldt's Ideen zu einer Physiognomik der Gewächse (1806) comes from Herder  's Ideen . Hanno Beck  , 'Kommentar,' to Ideen zu einer Physiognomik der Gewächse by Alexander von Humboldt (Darmstadt: Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, 1989), 287-328. Annette Graczyk also claims that Humboldt's notion of a 'general physical geography of plants' originates in Herder  's statement, in the Ideen , that his goal is to develop a 'general botanical geography of human history.'
