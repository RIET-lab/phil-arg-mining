Despite the doubt cast by Anneliese Maier, it has been recently demonstrated that Godfrey of Fontaines did set forth this theory in the 1290s.  Still more 1 recently, Brian Conolly has shown that Dietrich of Freiberg too had defended a similar solution.  With the present contribution, I would 2 like to add James of Metz and Durand of Saint-Pourçain to the list of those who upheld, albeit with some perplexity, the succession theory before Burley.  I also document that James and Durand bear witness to 3 Godfrey's in fl uence on some Dominicans at the beginning of the 14 th century, as they receive the principles and arguments that support the theory directly from him. On the other hand, Hervaeus Natalis and some other Dominicans tried to counter this in fl uence and the criti-\n\n- 1. See J. C éleyrette - J.-L.

A number of texts echo the lively debates  that  ensued. Th us,  the  question  of  intensi fi cation/remission opens a window on the complex intellectual situation of the Dominican order in Paris in the fi rst decade of the 14 th century.\n\n## 1 . T he C ompeting T heories\n\nBefore proceeding, it will be useful to review the main positions, each of which is best understood with reference to the others.\n\nTh ree theories in the Middle Ages were competing to explain processes such as a thing becoming warmer, or whiter, or a soul becoming more virtuous-in brief, what is known as the augmentation and diminution of qualities, and, because the magnitudes in question are intensive magnitudes, is more aptly called intensi fi cation or remission of qualities. 4\n\nA. Th e addition theory, popular among the Franciscans, rests on the principle that intensi fi cation and remission are like augmentation or diminution inasmuch as they can happen only in wholes where parts can be distinguished and added to or subtracted from each other. Bonaventure, Richard of Menneville (Mediavilla), Olivi, and Duns Scotus all say that forms that intensify acquire something really new which is added to what they already had, that is to say, a new degree is added to the degrees previously contained in the essence of those forms, and constitutes with them a new whole.\n\nTh e  problem  with  this  theory  may  be  that  these  degrees  or  parts of  essence  that  can  be  dissociated  or  welded  together  do  not  have  a clearly de fi ned ontological status. What does it mean for an essence to be divisible into parts that, obviously, are not its 'subjective' or logical parts such as genus or speci fi c di ff erence? Greater whiteness or greater\n\n4.

What are, on the other hand, these parts of an essence which can be acquired or lost, and which are therefore not essential?\n\nB.  On  the  opposite  side, Th omas  Aquinas  upholds  the  principle that forms are indivisible (other than logically), and therefore cannot undergo any change. 5 Th is principle has a Neoplatonic ring to it and was indeed transmitted by Boethius in his commentary on Aristotle's Categories . Accordingly, Boethius' response to the question of intensifi cation is that, since essences in themselves cannot change, only the qualia , that is, participations in a quality Q , can be more or less q , while Q in itself is not modi fi ed. 6 Th omas follows suit and argues along the same lines: di ff erences in intensity cannot a ff ect the nature of the form that goes through this kind of change. Th erefore, a qualitative variation has to come from an extrinsic factor, which can only be the way in which this form is received in a subject. William of Peyre of Godin, an in fl uential Dominican towards the end of the 13 th century (he   probably lectured on the Sentences in Paris in 1299-1300), faithfully summarizes Aquinas's theory in his Lectura Th omasina :\n\n- […] &lt;caritas&gt;  augetur  per  intensionem  vel  secundum  accessum  ad  terminum sicut qualitates prime. Circa quod notandum quod est augmentum primarum qualitatum ex causis suis, scilicet agente et recipiente. Ex agente autem in quantum ipsum agens per formam suam intendit reducere   ipsum patiens de potentia in actum sue forme quantum possibile est sibi. Sicut autem non-calidum est in potentia calidum, ita minus calidum est in potentia respectu magis calidi; unde sicut per actionem calefaciendi e ffi citur aliquid de non-calido calidum, non quia ponatur ibi alius [ms. aliquis]    calor,  sed  quia  calor  qui  est  in  potentia  reducitur  in  actum,  ita etiam de minus calido e ffi citur magis calidum inquantum educitur calor qui erat in minus calido ut actus imperfectus in maiorem perfectionem et\n- 5.

'Sed hoc solum dicere possumus magis habere sanitatem aliquem, id est esse saniorem, et magis sanum, et minus sanum. Dicimus ergo quod ipsae quidem qualitates non suscipiunt magis et minus' ( In Categorias Aristotelis, III, PL 64, 257 C). Aristotle himself left unanswered this question that he raised in the Categories , namely, whether the qualities or the qualia are susceptible of being more or being less what they are ( Cat . 8, 10b 30 - 11a 2).\n\nassimilationem agentis.

As a consequence, it must be understood in the same 8 terms as a wholesale alteration, that is, as the progressive   actualization of the form of the agent in the patient. Th e process is the same whether it is from one contrary to another (for instance, from black to white), or from a lesser actuality of this form to a greater actuality (for instance, from a less intense white to a more intense white). Th is  process can also be described as an ' accessus ad terminum ,'  in which the form gets 9 closer and closer to a maximum of actualization (or the opposite of it). Th e  actualization  of  the  form  in  the  patient  can  vary  either  because of the action of the agent becoming stronger or weaker (as when one moves away from, or closer to, a source of heat), or, supposing that the action of the cause is uniform, because of a di ff erence in the disposition of the receiving subject (at the same distance from the source of heat, a wet item will be heated less easily than a dry one; or, as Godin submits, air becomes more luminous when it gets thinner, while the illumination by the sun remains the same).\n\n- 7.

See the analysis of alteration in A ristoteles , Physica , V.2, 226b 1-2.\n\nHowever, Aquinas's response is not entirely satisfying. He contends that to be more 'established' or 'rooted' in a subject means, for an accidental form, to augment 'in essence' ( essentialiter ). But this does not account su ffi ciently for canonical expressions such as 'charity deserves to be augmented' ( caritas  meretur augeri ),  which seems to imply that charity itself can be intensi fi ed, and not just that an immutable form of charity can become more established in a soul, or is more participated in that soul. 10 Th e inherence of an accidental form in a subject certainly can increase or decrease, but inherence is a property that is common to all accidents and is di ff erent from their quidditative content or speci fi c nature. What we want to be able to say is that the quidditative content itself aries, not just the 'being in' of the form; and what we want to know is v why certain accidental forms only (those of the third kind of qualities) 11 can be intensi fi ed and diminished, and not the others, whereas all are 'in' a subject. Must not this be related to their intrinsic nature?\n\nWe shall see that,  as  a  result  of  this  problem  with  Aquinas's  solution, some self-styled followers of Aquinas such as Hervaeus Natalis are inclined to admit a 'latitude' within intensi fi able forms. 12 Th ese forms must have a certain margin of indetermination to make possible their being participated in more or less by the subjects in which they are received. Th e novel point is that the variation in reception is conditioned not only by the receptivity of the subject, but also by this relative indetermination of the form, instead of the form being absolutely rigid and not modi fi able. Th is represents a departure from Aquinas's original position, even though Aquinas himself seems to say as much in a few texts. 13\n\nC. On the other hand, other followers of Aquinas on this count strictly maintain the absolute determination and immutability of the forms. Th is  is  the  case  with  both  Giles  of  Rome  and  Godfrey  of  Fontaines. For Giles, the esse of  the  form  can  vary  (in  accordance  with  the  way it is received in a subject), while its essence remains what it is without\n\n10. The expression comes from Augustine and Alypius, Epist. 186 ( ad Paulinum ), 3.10 (CSEL t. 57, p. 53). It is most often adduced in discussions about charity in commentaries on d. 17 of book I of Peter Lombard's Sententiae , which is the locus classicus for theologians to discuss the intensification/remission of qualities.\n\n- 12.

Naturally, they are tokens of the same species or nature; but each is a di ff erent 'individual contraction' of that nature, as Godfrey puts it. Each form is in itself non-intensi fi able and represents a fi xed degree of a quality. When they succeed each other, a variation in degree occurs, each being more intense (or less) than the previous one. 15 However, the introduction of a new form or degree presupposes that the previous one is destroyed, since two forms of a same species cannot be actualized at the same time in the same subject; nor can the new one merge with the previous one or combine with it. Consequently, the apparent   continuous increase or decrease of one and the same quality is in fact, for Godfrey, a series of instantaneous replacement of one form by another of the same species but of a di ff erent intensity, that is to say, a series of corruptions and generations of di ff erent accidents. T ransitory forms unceasingly succeed each other in the same subject until the end of the process.\n\nAs  I  will  show  in  the  following  pages,  Godfrey's  solution  was favorably  received  by  James  of  Metz  and  Durand  of  Saint-Pourçain as an alternative to both Giles' theory and Godin's mere repetition of Aquinas. Th is led them to steer away from the o ffi cial Th omistic orthodoxy sought by the Dominican order, and triggered the intervention of Hervaeus Natalis (even though he himself was not completely faithful to Aquinas, as noted above and as we will see again below).\n\n## 2 .

T wo di ff erent actions must have two di ff erent end points. 16 For instance, as Aristotle remarks, the health (which is an accidental form) restored after a disease is not the same health that was had before the disease, because each of them results from a di ff erent action. 17 Now, if we warm up something to a certain degree of heat, stop for a moment, then warm it up again to a higher degree, two actions have been successively carried out. Th erefore, two di ff erent end points have been successively reached; two forms have been successively actualized.\n\nTh is is to say that the second degree is not the fi rst degree intensi fi ed, but another form, distinct from the fi rst one. Th e fi rst form has been actualized, then destroyed and replaced by another more intense form.\n\n- G2 : If the higher degree of the quality is not a form that is other than the lower degree of the same quality, the higher degree is not really di ff erent from the lower degree, which is absurd.

But if there is in the higher degree something that was not in the lower degree, they are two di ff erent forms, because forms are indivisible. 18\n- G3 : Th e starting point and the end point of a change process, i.e. the terminus a quo and the terminus ad quem , must be really distinct from each other, otherwise there would be no change. 19 Th is is obvious in local motion (one has to leave a place in order to arrive at another), and also in alteration in the\n- 16.

Th is entails that the more intense whiteness is really distinct from the less intense whiteness that was in the same subject; it has to be another form.\n\nIn other words, the two forms are numerically distinct, although they belong  to  the  same  species. Th eir  subject  is  not  determined  by  the same contractio of the accidental quality before and after the change. 21 Th rough the intensi fi cation process, the same speci fi c nature remains, but the individual occurrences of this nature succeed each other.

S chabel , 'James of Metz's Lectura on the Sentences ,' p. 355).\n\nother manuscripts of James's work re fl ect   another version of this secunda lectura . I will rely mostly on the T royes   manuscript, which, with its Additiones , o ff ers a fuller picture of James's thinking about the intensi fi cation and remission of qualities.\n\nOn that topic, James's main target in book I, d. 17, p. 2, q. 1, is Giles of Rome. However, he signi fi cantly departs from Aquinas's position too, insofar as Giles and Th omas, while they think that in general essences cannot vary in any way, both make an exception for those that derive their species from something to which they are related. Th e argument brought up by Giles to make room for this sole exception is directly borrowed from Aquinas. So when James criticizes this argument, it is in e ff ect a passage of the Summa Th eologiae (I II a ae , q. 52, art.1) that he is taking to task. No type of accidental form has a special status, he objects, and what is said of one must be said of the others. If some accidental forms cannot vary in essence by intensi fi cation, none can. But this is belied by obvious examples, including motion. Conversely, if some accidental forms can have a variation in essence, then all can, contrary to Th omas's and Giles's claim.\n\nIn the next question (q. 2), James turns to the way in which intensi fi cation or remission are carried out. After fi rst gainsaying the addition theory with the standard argument that no addable or subtractable distinct parts can be isolated in an essence, and then presenting a theory of Th omistic inspiration which might be Th omas of Sutton's, James introduces Godfrey's theory of succession and supports it with four arguments.\n\nTh e fi rst one is directly borrowed from Godfrey's own fi rst argument. It rests on the relation between an action and the terminus of the action:\n\n- J1 : Any new action, and therefore any augmentation or remission, has a new end point, that is to say, results in the actualization of a new form, which presupposes the corruption of the previous form; hence, the process is a succession of di ff erent forms. 24\n\nHowever, James develops this argument in an interesting way. Th e end point of an intensi fi cation or remission is either an essence, or some esse , or a mode of being (this tripartite division is supposed to exhaust all the possibilities). 25\n\n- 24. Ms. Troyes Bibl. Munic. 992 (hereafter T) f. 45ra l. 42 - f. 45 rb l. 19.\n- 25. In this question James again principally targets Giles of Rome.\n\n- a) If the end point of the action is a new essence, either the previous essence has been corrupted, which is what had to be proven, or it has not been corrupted. If the second, then the previous essence remains while the new end point is acquired. Th is new end point must be aggregated to the essence previously held, because two essences of the same kind cannot coexist in the same subject. Th erefore, the augmented nature has parts and is not simple-which cannot be admitted.\n- b) If the end point of the action is a new esse (which is speci fi cally Giles's view),  the  same  demonstration  ensues:  either  this esse subsists  together with the new esse of the acquired form, but this is impossible because the esse of a form must be as simple as its essence is; or the esse of the initial form is destroyed, and so its essence is destroyed too, QED.\n- c)  If  the  end  point  is  a  mode  of  being  ( modus essendi )  of  the  form,  two alternatives branch out. First, this mode might be something absolute, that is, a form. But then, by the same reasoning as before, the previous mode must be corrupted, and so why not admit that the previous form itself (not just its mode) is corrupted? Or, second, one might claim that this mode is something   relative. But this is impossible because the intensi fi cation or remission, which is a real action, cannot have for its end point something which is not absolute.\n\n## James's second argument rephrases Godfrey's second argument:\n\n- J2 : In any change whatsoever, and at every instant, that according to which there is change is always di ff erent. For instance, in a local motion the place ( ubi ) of the body in motion is constantly di ff erent. But that according to which there is change is always a form; such is the case for the ubi , or for a quality of the third kind in an intensi fi cation/remission. In fact, any change whatsoever always involves a modi fi cation of one of the forms that the subject of the change has. Whereas the subject itself remains the same through an accidental change, one of its accidental forms varies, and this is why the subject can be said to be now otherwise than it was. But if the accidental form is modi fi ed, it has to become radically other, because this form is the instantiation  of  a  certain  essence,  and  as  such  is  simple. Th is  particular form is the quality obtaining in a certain degree, and another degree has to\n\nbe another form, another instantiation of the same quality. Th erefore, the previous form must be corrupted and a new one introduced. 26\n\nJames's third argument rests on the nature of change itself, in accordance with Godfrey's third argument:\n\n- J3 : In any change whatsoever, the initial condition ( terminus a quo ) and the end point ( terminus ad quem ) must be di ff erent and cannot occur simultaneously: the very nature of change is the passing from one to the other, the subject leaving the initial condition to acquire a new state. Th erefore, the same form cannot obtain at the start and at the end of the change. 27\n\nTh e Additions of the Troyes manuscript o ff er a fourth argument, described  as  'trickier'  ( di ffi cilior ).  Let  us  note fi rst  that  this  argument seems to be James's creation, and second that it is found only in the version of the secunda lectura given by the T royes Additions, and not in the other manuscripts of the secunda lectura .\n\n- J4 : Suppose that a fi re just starts warming up water. Th is is the very beginning of an alteration, but no form of heat is actualized yet, for if one immediately stops the process, the water is still cold, and the form coldness cannot coexist with the form of heat (we'll get back to this point momentarily). However, the fi re did act, and therefore did cause something in the water. Th e only possibility left is that it caused a lesser coldness, rather than some heat. But this lesser coldness cannot be the initial form of coldness that would have been simply diminished, because such weakening would only  be  a  privation,  whereas  the  action  of  the fi re,  which  is  a  real  and positive action, must have a positive result. Th ence, one must conclude that the fi re actualized a new form, which is a token of coldness at a lesser degree. Th is,  in  turn,  implies  that  the  initial  form  of  coldness  has  been destroyed, for the reasons we saw above. 28\n\nHowever, one might ask, why would cold and heat not be able to coexist in the same subject? James notes that some people maintain that this is\n\n26. T f. 45 rb l. 19-29. Cf. C. S chabel , 'Place, space, and the physics of grace,' pp.\n\n28. T f. 16 rb l. 13-37.\n\n127-130. 27. T f. 45 rb l. 29-35.\n\nnot impossible if cold and heat are not in their maximum degrees, but are each in an intermediary degree. 29 But he rejects this idea. Even if cold and heat are attenuated qualities and are not maximally contrary to each other, they have respectively the status of terminus a quo and ad quem and are therefore incompatible in the same instant. Th is again is  the  thrust  of  Godfrey's  second  argument:  the  two    limits  ( termini ) of change, the starting point and the end point, cannot   coexist. Th e fi rst state of a ff airs must have ceased to exist before the second can be reached. In other words, the fi rst form must be destroyed for another one to be actualized.\n\nIn a somehow endearing manner, James does not rest his case but raises four doubts about the theory he has just defended, and in the end candidly admits he has no response for one of them, namely the di ffi culty that arises from the fourth argument I have just presented. Th e problem with the idea that, by a brief application of heat to cold water, a diminished cold succeeds to a more intense cold, is that it looks absurd that something hot should cause coldness, albeit a diminished one. Something hot can only actualize heat, because every agent produces something similar to itself. James envisions two ways of solving this di ffi culty. 30\n\nTh e fi rst way distinguishes between production of the last e ff ect of a process and production of an intermediary e ff ect, that is a step towards the last e ff ect. An example of this is the production of sperm, which precedes  the  production  of  the  end  e ff ect,  a  new  living  being. Th is example is supposed to show that it is possible for an agent (a living being) to produce fi rst, as an intermediary e ff ect, an e ff ect that does not resemble it (the sperm, which is not a living being), before producing the end e ff ect, which does resemble it (another living being). Likewise, heat may begin its action by producing something opposite to its nature (remitted coldness), provided that this is only a step towards the end of the action, which is to cause heat in the water. James, however is reluctant to accept this solution. It de fi es our imagination, he says, to admit that heat could cause coldness in any way whatsoever.\n\n- 29. This is what D uns S cotus , for instance, objects against Godfrey in Ordinatio , l. I, d. 17 pars 2, q. 2, in: Opera Omnia , t. V , Vatican 1959, § 242, p. 255.\n\n30. T f. 16 rb l.60 - 16 va l.44. Cf. I ohannes D uns S cotus , Ordinatio , l. I, d. 17 pars 2, q. 1, in: Opera Omnia , t. V , Vatican 1959, § 212, p. 243. We will review below another difficulty raised by James, together with the objection made by the Correctorium fratris Iacobi Metensis (see, below, CO1 , p. 314).\n\nTh e second way relies on the idea that two agents, one hot and the other cold, for instance fi re and air, can act on the same patient and produce one shared e ff ect. Th us, the fi re heats the water while the surrounding air cools it down, and their common e ff ect that is fi rst produced is a diminished coldness, because at that moment the action of the air is still more powerful than the action of the fi re. In this process, the fi re produces nothing but heat; but the action of the air explains that the result is for now only a diminished coldness. However, James rejects this solution too. Suppose that the water is heated up in an oven. Th ere, the air is hot too. Take the water container out of the oven just after having put it in: the water is still cold, even if it is cold in a lesser degree. Nonetheless, both the fi re and the hot air must have had an action, however brief, and this action cannot be but the actualization of some heat. What happened to this heat? 'I do not see any solution to this,' James confesses. What perplexes him is that instead of simply admitting that the action of heat is to destroy some degrees of the form of coldness (as the addition theory wants it), he is committed to show that it causes a whole new form of coldness, and he cannot explain how this is possible. Th is is a serious blow to the succession theory, which James leaves unanswered. In his wake, opponents and supporters of the theory will fi ercely discuss the case at hand. 31\n\n## 4 . H ervaeus N atalis and the CORRECTORIUM FRATRIS IACOBI METENSIS\n\nJames quickly was the target of reprehensions emanating from his own order. On the one hand, in his commentary on the Sentences Hervaeus Natalis criticizes James. On the other hand, a text known as the Correctorium fratris Iacobi Metensis , today preserved in a single manuscript, Le Mans Bibliothèque Municipale 231, discusses forty-three contentious theses of James. In both works, the succession theory is part of what James is blamed for.\n\nHervaeus likely commented on the Sentences in 1302-1303, 32 that\n\n- 31. Peter Auriol still uses the same example around 1317. See the passage of the Reportatio quoted by C. S chabel , 'Place, Space, and the Physics of Grace in Auriol's Sentences Commentary,' in: Vivarium 38/1 (2000), 117-161, pp. 119-120.\n- 32. According to W. D uba -  C.  S chabel ,  'Remigio,  Auriol,  Scotus,  and  the  myth of the two-year Sentences lecture at Paris,' p. 157 (see also C. S chabel , 'James of Metz's Lectura on the Sentences ,' p. 355). Earlier, it was generally believed that Hervaeus lectured in Paris from 1302 to 1304.\n\nis, shortly after James. In a recent book, Mikolaj Olszewski has identi fi ed  the  manuscripts  Bordeaux  Bibliothèque  Municipale  147  and Troyes  Bibliothèque  Municipale  ('Médiathèque  du  Grand  Troyes') 262 as witnesses of a fi rst version (a reportatio ? an ordinatio ?) of Hervaeus'  commentary, whereas the second version, a later redaction, is more common and well-known. 33 However, as far as the question on how intensi fi cation and remission occur is concerned (l. I, dist.17, &lt;q. 5&gt; 'Utrum caritas augeatur per additionem'), the fi rst version 34 does not di ff er much from the second version, 35 which I have consulted in the 1647 edition checked with the manuscripts Basel Universitätsbibliothek B IV 13 and Firenze Bibl. Naz., conv. sopp. B I 569. As I will show, in both versions Hervaeus discusses James's secunda lectura . 36\n\nAs  for  the Correctorium ,  it  was  probably  written  about  the  same period.  James  likely  disappeared  from  the  stage  shortly  after  having commented on the Sentences for the second time (in any case, we have no other trace of him whatsoever.) But Josef Koch has noted that the following passage of the Correctorium talks about James as if he were still  alive:  'Sed  iste  [James]  dicit  quod  non  videt  hanc  solutionem. Roget ergo Deum ut aperiat sibi oculos, ut possit videre; non video aliud  remedium.' 37 If  that  is  correct,  the Correctorium ,  which  refers also to James's secunda lectura (as  I'll  show  momentarily), must have been compiled not too long after 1301, that is to say, around the time Hervaeus was commenting on the Sentences in his turn.\n\nIn fact, Koch attributed the Correctorium to Hervaeus himself, on the grounds that there are numerous parallel passages in Hervaeus' Commentary . 38 Th is ascription has recently been challenged by Olszewski because the conception of theology as a discipline that the Correctorium attacks\n\n- 33. O lszewski , Dominican Theology at the Crossroads, p. 11.\n- 35. Except that in the Bordeaux manuscript, the question suddenly ends after the presentation of the third opinion, with the result that it includes neither Hervaeus' answer nor the replies to others' arguments.\n- 34. Troyes BM 262, f. 46vb - 48ra; Bordeaux BM 147, f. 47r-48r.\n- 36. This counterbalances O lszewski ' s remark ( Dominican Theology , p. 3) that Hervaeus used James's prima lectura to write the prologue to his Commentary . To be clear: I do not deny that Hervaeus knew the prima lectura ; I will just point out that he discusses an argument that is probably James's and is found only in the latter's secunda lectura .\n\n38. See K och , 'Jakob von Metz,' pp. 194-202.\n\n- 37. Ms. Le Mans 231, f. 170 va. See J. K och , 'Jakob von Metz, O.P ., der Lehrer des Durandus de S. Porciano, O.P .,' in: Archives d'Histoire Doctrinale et Littéraire du Moyen Age 4 (1929-30), 169-232, pp. 206-207, and id ., Durandus de S. Porciano O. P . Forschungen zum Streit um Thomas von Aquin zu Beginn des 14. Jahrhunderts. I. T eil : Literargeschichtliche Grundlegung , Münster in W. 1927,  p. 271.\n\nis not only James's but also Hervaeus' 39 - unsurprisingly so, because, as Oslzewski has shown too, 40 Hervaeus extensively reproduced passages of the prologue of James's Commentary on the Sentences in his own Commentary . As for the latter point, however, I'll note that, as strange as it may be, it would not be the only time that a censor plagiarized (to use an anachronistic concept) the very victim of his censorship. Even though James of Lausanne was, as a baccalaureus sententiarius , a member of the Dominican  commission  presided  over  by  Hervaeus  that  investigated Durand of Saint-Pourçain's alleged errors in 1314, he felt free to copy extensively from Durand's Commentary when, in the same year or the following one, he wrote his own Commentary (hopefully on topics that were not among the articles censored; at least, that is the case for the issue of intension/remission.) 41 So the fact that Hervaeus took advantage of  James's  prologue  may  be  not  conclusive  regarding  Hervaeus'  noninvolvement in the Correctorium . Perhaps Olszewski's other argument, based on the conception of theology attacked by the Correctorium and shared by James and Hervaeus, is more decisive. However, as far as the two questions on the intensi fi cation/remission of forms are concerned, not only is the Correctorium perfectly in phase with Hervaeus' position, but q. 6 contains two passages that are word for word identical with Hervaeus' Commentary on the Sentences , book I, d. 17, q. 4, a.1. Th ese passages constitute the core of the responsio in the Correctorium , and they are respectively 38 and 47 lines long, out of the 137 lines of the whole question. Furthermore, q. 7 contains four shorter passages that are nearly identical with passages of q. 5 of Hervaeus' Commentary . Th is raises the  question  of  whether  the  author  of  the Correctorium copied  from Hervaeus, or Hervaeus from the author of the Correctorium , in case they are not one and the same person. 42 I shall leave at that the question of the authorship of the Correctorium , which still requires much research. Whatever the case may be, it is certain that the author, as Hervaeus in\n\n- 39. Dominican Theology at the Crossroads , p. 315.\n- 41. See J. C éleyrette -  J.-L. S olère ,  'Jacques de Lausanne, censeur et plagiaire de Durand de Saint-Pourçain: édition de la q. 2, d. 17 du l. I, de son Commentaire des Sentences ,' in: K. E mery - R.L. F riedman - A.

Another possible explanation would be that the Correctorium has  in  fact  several authors. Hervaeus would have taken care of the part on intensification/remission (among other topics), while the nature of theology would have been dealt with by someone else, who happened to be in disagreement with Hervaeus too.\n\nhis Commentary , was using James's secunda lectura , 43 at least for book I, since he mentions some dubia about James's d. 17, p. 2, q. 1 that are only in the T royes Additiones , and discusses the meaning of the passage of Aquinas's Summa Th eologiae quoted by James solely in the T royes Additiones .  V ery  likely,  the  author  of  the Correctorium worked on a text close to the one we know through the T royes manuscript under the form prima lectura plus Additiones .\n\n## 4 1 . . T he L atitude of F orms according to H ervaeus and the CORRECTORIUM\n\nEven though they criticize James, let us note that, in the matter of why certain qualitative forms can vary in intensity and whether this variation a ff ects their essence, both the Correctorium (f. 151 vb - 152 rb, &lt;q. 6&gt;) and Hervaeus' Commentary ( Sent . I, d. 17, q. 4) substantially modify Aquinas's position, inasmuch as they abandon the fi xity of the forms that are intensi fi able. 44 Th ese  forms  are  not  exactly  like  numbers, contrary to Aristotle's dictum ; they comprise a certain margin of indetermination, a range of possible degrees. 45 Aristotle only wanted\n\n- 43. As J. K och had noticed ('Jakob von Metz,' pp. 202-207).\n\n45. See A ristoteles , Metaphysica , VIII.3, 1043b33- 1044a9; cf. J ames of metz , Secunda lectura , T f. 15 vb l. 29-35, and H ervaeus N atalis , In quatuor libros Sententiarum commentaria, l. I d. 17 q. 4 a. 2, ad 3 m , Paris 1647, p. 95a C-D. Ibid ., pp. 93b D - 94a A: '(…) videtur mihi quod ratio quare aliqua forma suscipit magis et minus, est indeterminatio formae specificae, secundum quam est indeterminata ad hoc quod in sua essentia, vel saltem in suo esse ut alii dicunt, sit magis perfecta vel minus perfecta: quam indeterminationem alii latitudinem vel in essentia vel in esse nominant.' Cf. Subtilissima Heruei Natalis Britonis (…) quolibeta undecim (…) , Venise 1513, reprint Ridgewood (N.J.) 1966, Quodl. VI q. 11, f. 135 vb: 'in formis suscipientibus magis et minus, est quedam latitudo graduum, ita quod albedo intensa est quantum ad essentiam suam perfectior quam albedo remissa, non ita quod ista differentia graduum sit secundum absolutam rationem forme, quia differre secundum absolutam rationem forme est differre specie. Sed quia in natura forme est habilitas ad istam latitudinem graduum habendam in sua essentia, ex hoc quod non determinat sibi  gradum indivisibilem et precisum quo participetur a suo   subiecto, siue sit accidens separabile siue non, siue habeat esse in pluribus speciebus siue non.' I take this occasion to say that, although the authenticity of this 6 th Quodlibet (one of the Quodlibeta minora ) ascribed to Nédellec has been doubted, its q. 11 presents no doctrinal difference with Nédellec's other texts and is extremely close in the language, as can be seen in the previous passage and other quotes below. See also Amerini's article in this volume p. 173 fn. 19.\n\n- 44. Cf. T homas de A quino , Sum. Theol .  I II a ae ,  q.52 a.1 c.: '(…) species rerum sunt sicut numeri, in quibus additio vel diminutio variat speciem. Si igitur aliqua forma, vel quaecumque res, secundum seipsam vel secundum aliquid sui, sortiatur rationem speciei, necesse est quod, secundum se considerata, habeat determinatam rationem, quae neque in plus excedere, neque in minus deficere possit. Et huiusmodi sunt calor et albedo (…).'\n\nto say that their indetermination has limits, which cannot be exceeded without the intensi fi cation becoming a true alteration, that is, a change of species. In this, the Correctorium and Hervaeus' Commentary are in agreement with James. Th e doctrine that all forms are totally rigid (i.e., that there is no latitude in intensi fi able qualities) proved to be untenable for these Dominicans of the beginning of the 14 th century. 46\n\nNevertheless,  the Correctorium and  Hervaeus' Commentary try  to interpret Aquinas in a way that aligns him with this view. Th omas's thought is misinterpreted, they claim, if one makes him say (as Giles of Rome does) that absolute accidental forms such as qualities do not have in themselves a latitude of degrees. 47 A more intense whiteness is not just the same form received more perfectly. It is in itself (as opposed to: qua received) a more perfect whiteness than a less intense whiteness. Admittedly, the participation of the form by the subject can be greater or lesser, but the condition for this is that there must be a greater or lesser perfection in the essence of the accidental quality itself ('maioritas  vel  minoritas  quantum  ad  perfectionem  forme'). 48 Th us,  a  more intense whiteness has a greater perfection in essence than a less intense one. Both the Correctorium and Hervaeus' Commentary invoke the ad tertium of Aquinas's Summa theologiae II II a ae , q. 24, a. 4, where Th omas writes that for an accidental form, to be more rooted in its subject is to  be  augmented in essence. Th is  expression  must  be  taken  literally, which implies that something has changed in the essence itself. And when Aquinas writes (I II a ae , q. 52 a. 1) that that from which things have their species must be indivisible, one must understand that he is not speaking of some indivisibility in degrees within a form, but only of the formal di ff erences that divide a genus. Th is is why Th omas does not say that that from which things have their species is strictly indivisible, but that it is ' quasi indivisible,' the Correctorium and Hervaeus' Commentary contend.\n\nHowever, our authors do not lapse into the Franciscan conception of the composition of forms. Th e linchpin of their thesis consists in admitting,  not  distinct  degrees  in  this  latitude,  as  in  the  Franciscan\n\n46. Cf. already I ohannes P arisiensis (Q uidort ), Commentaire sur les Sentences ,  ed. J.-P . M üller , Rome 1961, vol. 1, p. 207 l. 136-137: 'Dicendum ergo quod forma accidentalis habet latitudinem infra quam sunt diversi gradus secundum quos potest augeri et minui' (see also p. 201 l. 61, p. 202 l. 82).\n\n- 48. See H ervaeus N atalis , ibid ., p. 94a-b.\n- 47.  See H ervaeus N atalis , I Sent. , d. 17 q. 4 a. 1, p. 93a.\n\ntheory, but 'virtual parts,' which are not determinable ( signabiles ) and cannot be added to each other properly speaking, but have a lesser or greater perfection in such a way that an inferior degree is virtually contained in a higher degree. 49\n\nAs for the exception Aquinas makes regarding relative forms ( Sum. Th eol . II II a ae , q. 24, a. 5), his thinking may have been poorly explained by some (probably Giles again), the Correctorium and Hervaeus' Commentary claim. 50 James is right, they both concede, when he points out that the terminus ad quem of a process, which is the form acquired by that change, is not di ff erent from the change itself. Change, in fact, is the very same form on the way towards actualization; complete actualization is the end of the process. James is also right to say that it is impossible that something obtains its intrinsic essence by reference to something extrinsic, especially in the case of forms that belong to an absolute category of being (in contrast to the category of relation), such as qualities are. However, a speci fi c nature may include something extrinsic in obliquo , for instance a fi nal cause (at least the proximate fi nal cause) or an e ffi cient cause. Th is is how, for instance, a habit is speci fi ed by that towards which it is directed. Although they have by themselves their own nature, this nature includes a reference to their object. It is in  that  sense,  the Correctorium and  Hervaeus' Commentary contend,\n\n49. Correctorium q. 7, ms. Le Mans 231, f. 152 va: 'Modo dico quod forma intensa non est diversa a remissa sicut totum a toto, sicut albedo a nigredine, sed magis sicut totum a parte, ita quod forma remissa se habet sicut pars et sicut id quod exceditur, sed intensa se habet sicut totum, non quidem secundum partes signabiles sed secundum partes virtuales.' Nédellec, I Sent. d. 17 q. 5, p. 98a, A-C: 'Quarta opinio quae videtur mihi ad praesens magis probabilis, est quod illud augmentum non fiat per additionem gradus ad gradum, ita quod sint ibi duo gradus distincti, quorum unus addatur alteri, et unus possit distincte signari ab altero: sed fit tale augmentum per hoc quod forma eadem quae prius erat imperfecta fit perfectior, ita quod ipsa facta intensa, habet plus quam prius, non secundum diversas partes signabiles, sed virtuales: ita quod primus gradus continetur in secunda virtute: sicut si aliqua aqua bicubita rarefiat et fiat tricubita, quantitas aquae rarefactae continet plus quam prius (...) non quidem secundum partem signabilem quae posset divisim signari ab aliis duobus cubitis praecedentibus, sed secundum partes virtuales.' Nédellec perhaps shows here some hesitation, as he submits, he says, 'the opinion which presently seems to me more probable.' However, as we will see in his Quodlibet II , this solution will become definitive. For the sake of room, I cannot explore more this notion of virtual parts here, but I intend to show elsewhere that Nédellec probably took this idea from I ohannes P ari -siensis (Q uidort ), I Sent. (ed. M üller , vol. 1, q.71 [= d.17 q.3], pp. 208-209) or Peter of Auvergne's Quodlibet III . On the example of rarefactions, cf. Peter Auriol as explained by C. S chabel , 'Place, space, and the physics of grace,' p. 123.\n\n50. Correctorium , q. 6, f. 151 vb - 152 ra; H ervaeus N atalis , I Sent . d. 17 q. 4, p. 93ab. The two passages are nearly identical.\n\nthat the whole of Aquinas's remark must be understood. Let us note, however, that the point is moot: Th omas introduced this remark to accommodate the exceptional case of motion and like realities that do intensify  or  increase  in  essence,  but  the Correctorium and  Hervaeus' Commentary admit as much for all intensi fi able natures.\n\n## 4 2 . . R efutation of J ames of M etz\n\nOn the other hand, the question of how intensi fi cation occurs is the real bone of contention between James and his fellow Dominicans. Both the Correctorium (f. 152 rb - 152 vb &lt;q. 7&gt;) and Hervaeus' Commentary (I, d. 17, q. 5) strenuously oppose the succession theory. However, the Correctorium focuses on James, as one would expect, whereas Hervaeus' Commentary takes  a  wider  view:  'Ista  positio,  licet  sit  magnorum  et subtilis …,' 51 Hervaeus writes, by which he surely alludes not to James, but more likely to the venerable Godfrey, and to Th omas of Bailly, who resolutely defended Godfrey's thesis. 52 Nevertheless, after presenting in support of the succession theory two arguments that can be traced back\n\n## 51. P . 97a, D.\n\n52. See the note in the margin: 'Contra opinionem Thomae' (p. 97a C), which refers, not to Thomas Aquinas, who does not hold this position, as we saw, but to Thomas of Bailly, who does sustain it in q. 15 of his Quodlibet III (see below p. 315). See also Bailly's Quodl. III q. 16 and Quodl. IV q. 11. Licensed in theology around 1300, Bailly disputed as master actu regens six quodlibetal questions between 1301 and 1307. He became chancellor of the University in 1316. Dumont suggests that he jumped into the defense of Godfrey's theory after Scotus's extensive attack against the latter ('Godfrey of Fontaines and the succession theory,' p. 102). Additionally, let us note that Godfrey was back to teaching in Paris around 1303-1304. R. L ambertini , 'Political Quodlibeta ,' in: C. S chabel (ed.), Theological Quodlibeta , t. I, p.459, has shown that the date of his Quodlibet III must be moved earlier than the year 1305 suggested by Glorieux (P . G lorieux , Répertoire des Maîtres en Théologie , Paris 1933, notice 214; La Littérature quodlibétique II , Paris 1935, pp. 273-277). Given that it is certain that Bailly's Quodlibet IV was held at Lent 1304 (since Bailly mentions the bull Inter cunctas , dated Feb. 17, 1304, and speaks of Benedict XI as being alive, whereas the latter died on July 7, 1304), his Quodlibet III must have been disputed in 1303 (Lent or Advent), which makes quite likely a dialogue with Nédellec, who was commenting or had just commented the Sentences at that time. This is confirmed, I think, by the fact that Bailly discusses and rejects at length the case of nutrition as a suitable comparison for intensification processes ( Quodl. III, q. 15, ed. P . G lorieux , Quodlibets, texte critique avec introduction, notes et tables , Paris 1960, pp. 211 and 216-217), which precisely is used by Nédellec and the Correctorium (see  below pp. 317-318). The fourth opinion that Bailly attacks in q. 11 of his Quodl. IV (ed. G lorieux , pp. 284-285) is also probably Nédellec's (cf. CR2 NR2 / and CR3 NR3 / below, p. 318).\n\nto Godfrey (see arguments G3 and G2 , above), 53 Hervaeus adds a third one, which I have found only in James: J4 (see NO2 hereafter). Unless this argument has in fact another origin, this seems to imply that James was important enough for Hervaeus to take him into account in his Sentences commentary. Moreover, discussions about this argument recur in the debate between Hervaeus and Durand of Saint-Pourçain that we will review next. As for the Correctorium , it reports, naturally enough, only the arguments found in James, namely, the three arguments that were already in the prima lectura ( J1 , J2 , J3 ), plus the additional argument introduced by the secunda lectura ( J4 ). Interestingly, the Correctorium presents them in the following order: J1 , J4 , J2 , J3 . Th is is perhaps the sign that the author had a version of James's secunda lectura in  which J4 ,  known  to  us  from  the Additiones in  the T royes manuscript, was included in the main text as the second argument (as it should if one follows the instructions given by the Additiones , T f. 16 rb l. 10-13). If so, this version of the secunda lectura was di ff erent from what we have, since J4 is found in no other manuscript than T royes, as I said earlier. Further, perhaps as another indication of a di ff erent version of James's secunda lectura , it is noteworthy that in J4 as reported by both the Correctorium and Hervaeus' Commentary the example offered is the opposite of the example proposed in the T royes Additiones : instead of an intensi fi cation of heat, the talk is of a diminution of heat. Let us fi rst  examine the objections presented by the Correctorium and Hervaeus' Commentary against the succession theory.\n\nTh e Correctorium notes with irony that James himself raised enough objections against his own position. 54 Hence, the author decides that he does not have to add more objections (contrary to what Hervaeus does in his Commentary ), but only to refute James's arguments in favor of the succession theory. However, after rejecting these arguments (as we'll see momentarily), the Correctorium lingers on the third doubt that James formulated against his own solution. 55 If in each instant of an intensi fi cation the previous form is destroyed and a new form generated, this change is in reality a discontinuous series of mutations, or, rather,\n\n- 53. Also argument 2 in Bailly's Quodlibet III q. 15, p. 209.\n- 55. Correctorium f. 152 vb.\n- 54. Ms. Le Mans 231, q. 7, f. 152 va. See above p. 310.\n\nof mutata esse , or again, if you will, a series of leaps from degree to degree, whereas an essential characteristic of change, in the framework of Aristotelian natural philosophy, is its continuity. 56\n\nA fi rst answer to this di ffi culty, which James reports, was given by Godfrey himself. 57 During  a  local  motion,  the  mobile  is  at  no  time totally in actuality in a place (this would be rest); it is only in a place in  actuality  mixed  with  potentiality,  passing  through  this  place  and tending to another one. Th is, according to Godfrey, makes its motion continuous. Likewise, in an intensi fi cation/remission the mobile never is in complete actuality under any of the intermediary forms. As each of these forms only has an imperfect being ( esse imperfectum ), their distinction and succession does not prevent the change from being continuous. However, James is not convinced by this response. At every moment of the process, he thinks, the subject of change must be under a form in full actuality: it has a certain degree of heat or a degree of whiteness, for instance.\n\nInstead, James proposes giving up on the requirement of continuity for changes in the category of quality, as opposed to other changes. 58 Local motion is continuous because of the continuous quantity ( magnitudo ) in which it takes place. In a qualitative change, there may be continuity too with respect to the subject, due to its extension, that is to say, in case its parts are a ff ected one after the other, without interruption. But as far as intensi fi cation as such is concerned (i.e. the intensi fi cation  of  a  quality  in  one  and  the  same  part),  continuity  is not necessary. Th e  model  to  follow  is  not  that  of  local  motion,  but that of illumination. Th e whole volume of air is instantaneously illuminated (or so the Aristotelians believed) as soon as the source of light is actualized, at least if all the parts of air are equally disposed to receive this illumination. Likewise, in an alteration, when a subject is in the ultimate state of preparation, it receives a quality instantaneously. But,\n\n56.  T f. 45 rb l. 48 - 45 va l. 2: 'Aliud dubium est quod mutatio ad formam accidentalem que est alteratio non erit continua set componeretur ex tot mutatis esse quot sunt gradus in essencia forme, puta albedinis uel caritatis.' T f. 16 va l. 45-49 (Addition, secunda lectura ): 'Tertium dubium est quod secundum hanc positionem alteracio non esset motus continuus sed agregatio mutatorum esse, quoniam videmus &lt;quod&gt; mutatio est corruptio unius et generatio alterius. Set per te in alteratione non est nisi corruptio gradus imperfecti forme et generatio gradus perfecti. Ergo non sunt ibi nisi mutata esse, quod est contra philosophum 6° physicorum.'\n\n57. T f. 45 va l. 2-12. Cf. G odefridus de F ontibus , Quodl. IX q. 11, p. 249. 58. T f. 45 va l. 12-23.\n\nin an intensi fi cation/remission, each degree is the ultimate preparation for the next degree. Th erefore, passing from one to the other is instantaneous, that is, is a mutation rather than a continuous change.\n\nTh e Correctorium staunchly rejects this idea:\n\nCO1 : Continuity is essential to any kind of change ('est passio motus in communi'). When Aristotle says that something can be instantaneously altered (like the air illuminated), he is not speaking of an alteration as a process, but of the result of this process, the resulting state ( alteratum esse ), which obtains immediately. When there really is a process, this change cannot be but continuous, and if there is an interruption at some point, what happens next is another process, not the continuation of the same process. It is therefore impossible that an intensi fi cation or a remission be a series of leaps or instantaneous changes. 59\n\nOn  the  other  hand,  Hervaeus' Commentary , probably  due  to  the eference  to r the 'magni,'  discusses  the  succession  theory  rather reverenter . Hervaeus does not declare it absurd, or even false, but only warns that it is open to serious objections. He presents three of them.\n\nNO1 :  A  change made of successive, numerically di ff erent forms, would require an in fi nite number of such forms. Th e reason behind this is that in the span of time in which this change takes place, there is an in fi nity of instants. Accordingly, there must be an in fi nity of degrees of the quality, because if the change is not interrupted, there are no two instants in which the quality has the same degree, the intensity of that quality changing constantly. Moreover, given that changes are distinguished by the forms that are acquired, one would in reality have an in fi nite number of changes ( mutationes ) in what is apparently one change, and there would accordingly be an in fi nity of states ( mutata esse ) of the subject of change. 60\n\n## 59. Correctorium q. 7, f. 152 vb.\n\n60. I Sent .  d. 17 q. 4, pp. 97a D - 97b A: '(...) quot sunt quae differunt secundum intensum et remissum, tot sunt formae differentes numero ab inuicem. Sed in qualibet alteratione successiua sunt infinita talia. Ergo in qualibet alteratione sunt infinitae formae differentes numero. (...) Minor probatur, quia quot sunt nunc in toto tempore alterationis, tot sunt differentes gradus secundum intensum et remissum, quia in toto tempore alterationis non est dare duo nunc in quibus forma secundum quam alteratio sit, sit in eodem gradu. Sed in quolibet tempore sunt infinita nunc. (…) Hoc autem est inconueniens, quia motus et mutationes plurificantur secundum formas quae acquiruntur per motum; et sic in qualibet alteratione essent infinitae mutationes in actu et infinita mutata esse.'\n\nAlthough this objection may be related to CO1 and James's third doubt because of the expression 'mutata esse,' Hervaeus does not place the emphasis on the discontinuity that would ensue, but on the in fi nity of steps that an intensi fi cation would have to go through-which, implicitly, makes it impossible, since going through an in fi nity is not a task that can be ever completed. Th e thrust of the objection is made explicit by Th omas of Bailly, who addresses it in his Quodlibet III, q. 15. 61 Hervaeus does report that the defenders of the succession theory answer that this in fi nity is in fi eri and in potentiality. 62 But their response is not tenable, he claims. If the forms are numerically distinct, they cannot be in continuity with each other; therefore, there is an actual in fi nity of such forms, and consequently an actual in fi nity of mutata esse .\n\nInterestingly, Hervaeus' second objection turns James's fourth argument ( J4 ) on its head:\n\nNO2 : When something cold diminishes heat, it does not actualize coldness  in  the  patient,  because  coldness  cannot  coexist  with  heat.  It  does not actualize a lesser heat either, because coldness cannot produce heat. 63 Th erefore, the agent does nothing. However, this cannot be taken in an absolute sense, because its action is real. Rather, it must be understood literally, so to speak, in the sense that the cold does not produce anything but simply takes away some of the heat (which is the 'privative' action that James does not admit.) Now, this entails that the same form of heat is diminished, rather than another form of a lesser degree produced. 64\n\n61. 'First difficulty,' ed. G lorieux , p. 212. Pace D umont ('Godfrey of Fontaines and the succession theory,' pp. 101-102), I do not think that the two objections, on discontinuity and infinity, raised by Scotus in his Parisian lecture are exactly the same as the one at hand. Moreover, the Oxford Lectura does raise the discontinuity objection, in terms that, in the end, are closer: 'si per recessum a quocumque gradu generetur aliud suppositum, igitur supposita sibi invicem continue succedunt secundum successionem motus. Quaero igitur an quodlibet illorum suppositorum persistit in indivisibili, aut divisibiliter et in divisibili temporis. Si in indivisibili, tantum manens per instans, igitur motus componeretur ex mutatis esse (...)' ( Lectura , l. I d. 17 p. 2, q.1, Opera Omnia t. XVII, Vatican 1966, n° 143, p. 226).\n\n- 63. On these two counts, then, Hervaeus thinks that James is right.\n\n62. I Sent. , d. 17, q. 4, 97b A. The potential infinite reply is in T homas de B ailly ( Quodl. III q. 15, pp. 213-214), but for the in fieri reply one probably has to go back to Godfrey himself ( Quodl. IX, q. 11, p. 249).\n\n- 64. I Sent . d. 17 q. 4, p. 97b B.\n\n## Finally, Hervaeus lodges a third objection:\n\nNO3 :  When a greater  quantity succeeds a  smaller  quantity  because  one subject succeeds another, one does not say that this is an augmentation of the smaller quantity. For instance, when fi re, which expands more, is engendered from air or water, which take less room, this is not a process of augmentation. It is a process of generation, and correlatively a new, greater form of quantity has replaced the lesser form of quantity. On the contrary, in a process of augmentation of the same thing, numerically the same accidental form of quantity is augmented. Likewise, if an intensi fi cation is really an increase, then it must be the same form that, initially imperfect, becomes perfect. If, on the contrary, a more perfect form replaced a less perfect form (as the succession theory wants it), one could not say that there is an increase. 65\n\nAfter this array of objections to the succession theory, we still have to survey the rebuttal of the arguments that support the theory.\n\nAs expected, the Correctorium refutes each of James's four arguments. Th ese refutations all have parallel passages in Hervaeus' Commentary . Although the latter does not report, and therefore does not discuss, G1 J1 / ,  the Correctorium gainsays J1 in  the  same  way  as  one  of  the Commentary ' s  rebuttals of the addition theory. Th e ad tertium of  the Commentary ' s q. 5 66 is supposed to respond to the third argument quod sic at the very beginning of the question, and this argument supports the addition theory (the incipit of the question being: 'Utrum caritas augeatur per additionem.') However, there is in fact a common point between the addition theory and the succession theory: both argue that if a change is real, it must bring something new, which was not already present (a 'part' or degree of the form according to the addition theory; a new form of a di ff erent degree for the succession theory). 67 Th is is why the Correctorium can use against J1 the same response as the one given by the Commentary ' s ad tertium :\n\n65. Ibid ., p. 97b B-D.\n\n67. Cf. G2 above and the third argument quod sic in Hervaeus' question: 'Praeterea aut aliquid acquiritur de novo in eo quod movetur motu intensionis, aut nihil; si nihil, ergo motus realis est ad nihil; si aliquid, ergo illud est additum de novo ei quod praeexistebat' (p. 96b B).\n\n66. Ibid, pp. 98a D - 98b A.\n\nCR1 : Th e fact that every action brings about something that is new and di ff erent from the starting point can be understood in two ways. Either the terminus ad quem di ff ers entirely from the terminus a quo ; or it di ff ers from it in part only. But a more intense quality di ff ers from a less intense that preceded it not in totality (like white di ff ers from black, for instance), but in such a way that the less intense becomes included in something greater, like a part in a whole. Th e new quality is not something altogether di ff erent; it is the same as the less intense one, but completed, more perfect. 68\n\nOf course, the talk is here about 'virtual parts,' as we saw earlier, and not distinguishable ( signabiles ) parts within the intensi fi ed form as if one could really di ff erentiate  ( signari  actu  distincter )  what  the  initial degree was and what has been brought about by the intensi fi cation.\n\nAnother response in q. 5 of Hervaeus' Commentary ,  the ad quintum , 69 which directly answers G2 (and therefore J2 ,  as  we'll  see momentarily), can also indirectly rebut J1 . Th e Correctorium does use it to provide an alternative refutation of J1 ('Vel potest dici…'):\n\nCR1' : True, something must be acquired during an intensi fi cation, but this something can be aggregated to what was before, not as a part actually distinct, but as a part distinct by disposition ( habitu ). 70\n\nAs  an  illustration  of  this  kind  of  distinction,  the Correctorium ,  like Hervaeus' Sentences commentary, 71 points  to  the  paradigm  of  nutrition. Food is aggregated to the matter of the body; however, the food remains somehow distinct, not in actuality, but by disposition, because it  could  exist  just  by  itself  if  it  were  taken  away. 72 Likewise,  what is brought about by the intensi fi cation becomes one with the quality that preexisted, and nevertheless is di ff erent from it. Th e increased quality\n\n68. F. 152 va. Cf. H ervaeus N atalis , Quodl., VI q.  11,  f.  135  vb:  '(…) dico quod motus intensionis terminatur ad aliquid reale habendum, quod quidem reale est aliquis gradus  forme  que  prius  non  habebat,  sed  ille  gradus  cedit  in  eandem  essentiam  cum preexistente albedine, que eius adventu efficitur perfectior quam prius, et ideo dicitur quod subiectum per modum intensionis reducitur in perfectiorem actum (…).'\n\n- 70.

Th e initial degree is contained virtually in the higher degree. If the initial degree did not somehow subsist, the agent would not be intensifying a given quality properly speaking, but producing instead a quality that is altogether di ff erent.\n\nTo James's second argument ( J2 ), Hervaeus' Commentary ( ad quintum ,  more  likely  against G2 ,  but  applicable  to J2 ),  and,  in  a  much shorter way, the Correctorium ( ad tertiam rationem ), 73 respond that:\n\nCR2 NR2 / : Th e accidental form which is that according to which change occurs only has to be, in the terminus ad quem , di ff erent from what it was in the terminus a quo in the same manner as a completed form di ff ers from an incomplete form, as we saw above in the responses to J1 . It need not be a di ff erent form. 74\n\nTo James's third argument (J3), the Correctorium ( ad quartam rationem ) 75 and  Hervaeus' Commentary ( ad  quartum ,  more  likely  against G3 , but applicable to J3) answer that:\n\nCR3 NR3 / : Th e terminus a  quo and  the terminus  ad  quem are  not incompatible with each other in regard to the positive essence of the quality, which they share. Th ey are opposed to each other only with regard to the privation of perfection (in the case of an intensi fi cation), which is present at the beginning and then eliminated by the change (and conversely for a remission). 76\n\nFinally, to James's fourth argument ( J4 ), both the Correctorium ( ad secundam rationem ) and Hervaeus' Commentary ( ad sextum ) answer the following:\n\nCR4 NR4 / : An agent that cools down a hot thing acts inasmuch as it obstructs the power that conserves heat, preventing this power from maintaining  the  heat  in  the  same  state. Th e  same  goes  for  local  motion:  an\n\n73. Recall that the Correctorium inserts J4 between J1 and J2 (see above, p. 310), which means that the latter becomes third.\n\n75.

Th e fi ght was not over though, as another supporter of the succession theory, or at least a variant of it, was looming within the Dominican order: Durand of Saint-Pourçain.\n\n## 5 .

As Walter Burley will later point out, 'many' endorse this solution. 80 Among those was, as we saw earlier, Th omas of Bailly, a prominent actor on the Parisian stage, 81 and Hervaeus deals with some of his arguments in the fi rst part of the question.

A. de G uimarães ('Hervé Noël (m. 1323): Etude biographique,' in: Archivum Fratrum Praedicatorum , 8 (1938), 5-81, p. 48) proposes Lent 1309 in order to allow some more time for Hervaeus' reaction to Durand's teaching (more on this below). He is seconded by P .T.

For other reactions to Bailly's defense of the succession theory in his Quodlibet III , see D umont , 'Godfrey of Fontaines and the succession theory,' pp. 102-105.\n\ndence I present below, however, I submit that the succession theory had also found a defender in the person of Durand of Saint-Pourçain. I also submit that Durand, who was baccalareus sententiarus at the time, was involved in the debate when this quodlibetal question was disputed.\n\nTh e general outline of the question is somewhat peculiar. It comprises two main parts:\n\n- A) Discussion of the validity of the following inference: 'If an intensi fi ed form is numerically di ff erent from the remitted form, there is an in fi nity of successive forms in an intensi fi cation.' 82\n- B) Discussion of the premiss of the inference, i.e., whether an intensi fi ed form is numerically di ff erent from the remitted form. 83\n\nSo, before coming to the core of the issue, namely, whether the succession theory is true, the whole fi rst part is about the legitimacy of a deduction which, as we saw, amounts to an objection to the succession theory (see NO1 , above), since going through an in fi nity of forms was thought to be an impossibility. Th is shows that the question put to Hervaeus is highly contextualized, and that the reader, so to speak, jumps in the middle of an ongoing discussion about the fairness of that objection, which had been raised by Hervaeus in his commentary on the Sentences and addressed by Th omas of Bailly in his Quodlibet III in 1303. Hervaeus intends here to demonstrate that the succession theory proponents do have to concede that an intensi fi cation comprises an in fi nity of successive forms (which makes the theory untenable), and he refutes two responses given by Th omas of Bailly: (1) even though all the forms of di ff erent degrees are numerically di ff erent within a given change, these forms nevertheless are one by continuity;  (2) their in fi nity is only in fi nite in potentiality. 84 For the sake of brevity, I will leave aside this discussion.\n\nTh e second part of the question begins with (1) a refutation of the premise of the inference, that is, the very thesis of the succession theory, thanks to a number of objections and the refutation of counterobjections. Th en, (2) Hervaeus explains how it is possible that a form remains numerically the same throughout the process while acquiring what it did not fi rst possess. I will leave these points aside too. Finally,\n\n82. Ff. 58 vb - 59 va.\n\n84. See T homas de B ailly , Quodlibet III q. 15, ed. G lorieux , p. 214.\n\n83. Ff. 59 va - 61 rb.\n\n(3) the discussion fl ares up again with the presentation of twelve objections to Hervaeus' thesis (which are so many arguments in favor of the succession theory), followed by their systematic refutation. 85 Th e addition of these twelve objections at the end makes the structure of the second part peculiar too and gives the impression of a live debate, in which a participant launches a new attack on the respondens with a new set of objections.\n\nTh ere are reasons to think that this objector was Durand. Bernard Lombardi, a Dominican who wrote a Sentences commentary in the late 1320s, 86 reports  very  extensively  Durand's  discussion  of  the  intensifi cation of forms. Durand's solution on the 'how' of intensi fi cation/ remission, as Lombardi presents it, is a variant of the succession theory, and  the  arguments  in  favor  of  this  theory  attributed  to  Durand  by Lombardi correspond to eight of the twelve fi nal objections in Hervaeus' question. Th ere is no room for uncertainty about their ascription to Durand: instead of the usual 'quidam dicunt' with at best an abbreviated name in the margin, the main text in one of the manuscripts reads in full letters: 'Alia opinio est Durandi qui ponit quod forma non subscipit magis et minus sic quod gradus remissus remaneat   adueniente intenso, ymo corrumpitur.' 87 Moreover, after rebutting Durand, Lombardi  provides  a  solution  which  is  (without  him  saying  it)  mostly  a long summary, sometimes a paraphrase, sometimes even word for word excerpts, of q. 13 of Hervaeus' Quodlibet II 88 - not only of the core of his solution, but also of the objections and responses that his question\n\n85.

Distinction 17 of book I of his Sentences commentary is found in three manuscripts: Naples Naz. VII G 98 on the one hand, Leipzig Univ. 542 and Erfurt CA 2° 368 on the other hand. The differences between them point to two different lecturae , or perhaps at least one reportatio . See also C. S chabel - R.L. F riedman - I.

Contrary to the case of book I dist. 38 that they examine, Bernardi's report of Durand's opinion cannot have been derived from Peter of Palude, as the latter's q. 2 of dist. 17 is very different.\n\n88. Leipzig f. 37rb-38ra, Erfurt f. 91vb-92vb.\n\ncontains. Th is may indicate that Lombardi was well aware of the debate between Hervaeus and Durand, and probably presented their two positions as they were, historically, pitted against each other.\n\nIn itself, the ascription of the succession theory to Durand should not come as a surprise. It might only con fi rm the intellectual a ffi liation between James of Metz and Durand that has been highlighted by Koch. 89 Since James probably lectured on the Sentences in  Paris  in  1300-01, Durand, who started around that time the three-year   lectorate program (see below), may well have attended his lectures and paid heed to his criticism of the Th omist conception of intensi fi cation and his move in favor of Godfrey's solution. However, let us note that a long passage of Durand's early version of his commentary on the Sentences that was not included in the fi nal version shows that Durand knew fi rst hand Godfrey's Quaestio ordinaria 18, which he analyzes and criticizes at length as far as the indivisibility of forms is concerned (Durand,   instead, admits the existence of degrees in forms). 90 Besides, we saw there were at the time other supporters of the succession theory. Th us, even if James did not hand down to Durand this theory, the latter had other possible sources of information.\n\nWhat may seem to pose a problem, however, is that Durand's succession theory as presented by Bernard Lombardi is not straightforwardly identical  to  Durand's  solution  in  the  last  and  'o ffi cial'  redaction  of his Commentary on the Sentences . 91 Furthermore, no theory at all can be found in the extant manuscripts of the earlier version(s) of book I either, as they do not tackle at all the question of how intensi fi cation takes place ('quomodo augeatur'). Th ey contain a single question on intensi fi cation: 'Utrum caritas augeri,' which only discusses in which forms intensi fi cation can take place. So, isn't Lombardi mistaken when he presents Durand as a proponent of the succession theory?\n\nIn  fact,  this  discrepancy  can  be  explained.  But fi rst,  let  me  summarize  the status quaestionis concerning  the  stages  of  the  writing  of Durand's Sentences commentary.\n\n- 89. J. K och , 'Jakob von Metz, O.P ., der Lehrer des Durandus de S. Porciano, O.P .'\n- 91. See below p. 339.\n- 90. Book I, d. 17, q. 3, ed. M. P errone - F . R etucci , Scriptum super IV Libros Sententiarum. Distinctiones 4-17 primi libri , Leuven 2017, pp. 236-245. How this acknowledgement of degrees in the essence of qualities is compatible with some variant of the succession theory will become clearer below. On the other hand, the explanation of why only qualities can be intensified or remitted ( ibid . pp. 246-249) is borrowed from Godfrey. Additionally, this early version contains (pp. 227-236) a presentation and refutation of Giles of Rome's theory, which was also left out in the final version.\n\nAccording to the reconstruction of Durand's early career provided by William Courtenay, 92 Durand received at the Dominicam studium generale in Paris, probably from 1300 to 1303, the three years training required for being a conventual theology lector , and then returned to the vicariate he was coming from, that of Burgundy, probably in the convent of Lyon. He was sent back to Paris to follow the curriculum leading to the theology doctorate. He was there in 1307 for a preparatory year, 93 and lectured on the Sentences as baccalaureus sententiarum in the academic year 1308-1309. 94 Whether he had already commented on the Sentences in a provincial convent 95 (if so, probably in Lyon), or simply had prepared his lecture notes in 1307-1308, 96 there was a fi rst version of his commentary, named redaction A by Koch, when Durand began lecturing in Paris. However, Durand's teaching came immediately under attack by Hervaeus Natalis, who was since 1307 the Dominican regent master. As Koch has shown, Hervaeus, in several questions of his Quodlibet II, held during Advent 1308 or Lent 1309, criticizes ideas contained in Durand's book I. 97 Moreover, in 1309 (Sept. 17)\n\n92. W.J. C ourtenay , 'Durand in his educational and intellectual context,' in A. S peer -F. R etucci , T . J eschke - G. G uldentops (eds.), Durand of Saint-Pourçain and his Sentences commentary. Historical, Philosophical and Theological Issues, Leuven 2014, pp. 13-34.\n\n94. 1308-1309 only, if one accepts Duba's and Schabel's conclusion that the lectures on all the books of the Sentences spanned a single academic year (see above, fn. 23, and in particular W . D uba - C. S chabel , 'Remigio, Auriol, Scotus, and the myth of the two-year Sentences lecture at Paris,' p. 157; see also C. S chabel , 'James of Metz's Lectura on the Sentences ,' p. 355). Courtenay's chapter, which predates Duba's and Schabel's paper, proposes 1308-09 and 1309-10.\n\n93. His name appears in a document related to the Templars affair, dated October 26 of that year, but after the names of those presented as doctors and bachelors in theology, which means he was not yet baccalaureus .\n\n95. As it is believed by R.L. F riedman , 'The Sentences Commentary, 1250-1320,' in: G.R. E vans (ed.), Mediaeval Commentaries on the Sentences of Peter Lombard , Leiden 2002, p. 71.\n\n97. See J. K och , Durandus , pp. 60-72, 214-215 and B. D ecker , Die Gotteslehre des Jakob von Metz. Untersuchungen zur Dominikanertheologie zu Beginn des 14. Jahrhunderts , Münster in W. 1967, pp. 85-88, who showed that Hervaeus' qq. 3, 7 and 8 respectively attack d. 36 q.\n\n96. See C ourtenay , 'Durand in his educational and intellectual context,' pp. 28-30. The second hypothesis, Courtenay notes, fits better with Durand's famous remark, in the conclusion of his 'official' version, that his early version had been circulated prematurely and without his consent: 'Scripta super quatuor Sententiarum libros iuvenis inchoavi, sed senex complevi; siquidem quod in primis dictaveram et scripseram fuit a quibusdam curiosis mihi subreptum, antequam fuisset per me sufficienter correctum (…)' ( In Petri Lombardi Sententias Theologicas Commentarium libri IIII [= Sent . C], 2 vols., V enice 1579; repr. Ridgewood, NJ 1964, f. 423rb). It would be hard to make sense of this, Courtenay thinks, if Durand had already lectured in a provincial convent, that is, publicized his views. On the other hand, let us keep in mind that Durand left in the final redaction a hint about the fact he gave several lecturae , since he speaks of his ' first lecture': 'Unde quod dixi alias in fine secundi libri sententiarum primae lecturae…' ( II Sent . C, d. 44, q. 5, n. 10, f. 208 ra).\n\nHervaeus was elected provincial of France (he will become general master of the order in 1318), and the same year the General Chapter of the order at Saragossa required Dominicans not to hold positions opposed to what was generally taken to be Aquinas's doctrine. 98 Under this pressure, and probably in view of securing his chances to be promoted to the   doctorate, Durand soon started to modify his commentary. Th is revision process, carried out before 1312, resulted in redaction B, in which Durand mitigated his criticism of and departure from Th omas Aquinas. 99 Later, when he entered an episcopal career (from 1317 on), and was thereby free from the jurisdiction of the Dominican order, Durand wrote a third and fi nal version of his commentary (redaction C), in which he returned to many of his original views, modi fi ed at times on the basis of criticisms he had received. 100\n\nLet us now go back to Bernard Lombardi. As I said, the succession theory he ascribes to Durand is not that of redaction C and is nowhere to be found (as, for that matter, any theory whatsoever on the 'how' of the intensi fi cation/remission) in the manuscripts we have of Durand's early  versions  of  his  commentary.  However,  as  far  as  book  I  is  concerned, all those manuscripts transmit the same redaction. Th is means that one of the two pre-1317 versions, either redaction A or redaction B, has disappeared. It is quite possible, then, that Lombardi discloses an otherwise unknown stage of Durand's thought.\n\nIn  which  version  might  he  have  presented  this  theory?  Koch  believed that the extant non-C manuscripts of book I contain redaction\n\n3, d. 33 q. 1, and d. 27 q. 2 of Durand's book I. For q. 7 and his attack on Durand's conception of relation in divinis , see I. I ribarren , Durandus , pp. 149-155.\n\n99. As a result, he received the doctorate and was appointed magister actu regens in 1312, probably thanks to the intervention of pope Clement V. Nonetheless, Durand was subjected to an investigation of the Dominican order, entrusted to a commission presided by Hervaeus, in 1313-1314 (decision of the General Chapter of Metz in 1313), and again in 1316-1317 (decision of the General Chapter of Montpellier in 1316). See K och , Durandus , pp. 68-72, 200-207, 410-417, and id ., 'Philosophische und theologische Irrtumslisten von 1270-1329: Ein Beitrag zur Entwicklung der theologischen Zensuren', in Kleine Schriften , Rome 1973, t.

B.M. R eichert , Monumenta Ordinis Fratrum Praedicatorum Historica 3 and 4, Rome 1889-1899, t. II, p. 38). See I ribar -ren , Durandus , p. 182, fn. 3, for whom the Saragossa regulation specifically targets Durand.\n\n100. Probably between 1318 and 1328. Cf. K och , Durandus , p. 16 sqq.\n\nA. Moreover, he believed that Durand did not issue a second redaction of book I. However, in their recent edition of the early version of distinctions 4-17 of book I, Massimo Perrone and Fiorella Retucci have reached the opposite conclusion: all the extant non-C manuscripts of book I contain redaction B (in two di ff erent stages of revision), and even for book I redaction A was di ff erent from redaction B. 101 Redaction A of book I, therefore, is no longer accessible to us. Th ence, we can surmise that what Bernard Lombardi reports is the content of a question of the now lost redaction A of distinction 17 in which Durand was adopting the succession theory. 102\n\nAs a matter of fact, the reversal of Koch's conclusion gives grounds for a very plausible scenario. It would be only logical that the young Durand, while he was fi rst studying in Paris between 1300 and 1303, under the in fl uence of James of Metz, adopted the succession theory. When he came back to Paris to comment on the Sentences , at the beginning of the academic year 1308-09, he held the same position while lecturing on d. 17 of book I and immediately clashed with Hervaeus on the topic of intensi fi cation among others. As noted above, Hervaeus' Quodlibet II was probably disputed either during the Advent of 1308,\n\n101. Pp. 20*-75* (see summary in Andreas Speer's 'Vorwort,' pp. 10*-11*). See also F. R etucci , 'Selected Problems in Books I-II of Durand's Sentences Commentary,' in A. S peer - F . R etucci - T. J eschke - G. G uldentops (eds.), Durand of Saint-Pourçain and his Sentences commentary , pp. 71-96, and M. P errone , 'Alcune osservazioni sulle fasi redazionali del Commento al I libro delle Sentenze di Durando di San Porciano (1270/75-1334),' Studi Filosofici XXXIX (2016), pp. 49-68. On pp. 59-60 of this article, Perrone shows that, because of an implicit quote from the second redaction of Alexander of Alexandria's commentary on the Sentences , Durand must have revised book I after 1308.\n\n102. I should add that Lombardi does not always report the content of redaction A. Immediately after this passage, art. 2 of the same question ('Quae est causa precisa susceptionis magis et minus') is nothing but a transcription word for word of q. 6 of Durand's redaction C (probably because in this final version, Durand criticizes the explanation he had given earlier-i.e., redaction B, book I, d. 17, q. 3, ed. P errone - R etucci , pp. 246249-about the reasons why certain forms are intensifiable and remittable). I'll comment more on this fact in the conclusion. For now, let me just emphasize that Bernard had access to  different  redactions  of  Durand's  commentary (Durand's concern over leaving a definitive version that would be clearly recognizable probably shows that he feared that the earlier drafts were still in circulation-see above, fn. 96, the quote from the conclusion of Durand's Commentary ,  which is to be completed by these words: 'propter quod hoc opus solum, quod per omnes libros incipit 'Est Deus in caelo revelans etc.' tanquam per me editum et correctum approbo'). Incidentally, this means that, for the discussion of the 'how' of intensification/remission (art. 1), Lombardi chose Durand's solution in redaction A, while he knew redaction C (in which Durand has somehow modified his view; see below p. 339). Why? Probably because Bernard, who rallies to Hervaeus' solution in Quodlibet II which he copies extensively in art. 1, wanted to give the whole context of Hervaeus' question 13, in which Durand was involved.\n\nor Lent of 1309. Admittedly, Hervaeus, in the question on intensi fi cation  (q.  13), fi rst  addresses  a  more  important  adversary: Th omas of Bailly, as I noted above. But recall the peculiar structure of the question: towards the end of the second part, it appears that an opponent (or several opponents) raises a series of twelve new objections that favor the succession theory. Now, eight of these objections are arguments for the succession theory that Bernard Lombardi ascribes to Durand (from the corresponding question in redaction A, if my hypothesis is correct). So it is not too far-fetched to imagine that Durand himself, or perhaps a student of his who had taken notes on his recent lecture on the intensi fi cation and remission of qualities, might have intervened in the discussion of Hervaeus' quodlibetal question and put forward these objections. It wouldn't be the only time that Durand would have debated with Hervaeus: together with an important question on cognition from Durand's early version of the Commentary on the Sentences , Koch has edited a disputed question presided over by Hervaeus in which, Koch says, Durand, defending the same theses as in his Commentary , played the role of the opponent. 103 And as we know, a number of other questions of Hervaeus' Quodlibet II  were speci fi cally targeting Durand. 104 To these questions that reveal the increasing tension between Hervaeus and Durand, it seems permissible, therefore, to add the end of q. 13.\n\nFurthermore, as said above, Durand had to modify his commentary on the Sentences to  align it more with Dominican orthodoxy, that is to say, with Th omas Aquinas's teachings. During this process, which resulted  in  redaction  B,  Durand  omitted  whole  questions  that  were too controversial, with the consequence that redaction B is generally a shortened text compared to the initial version. 105 Th at is exactly what happened with the question on the 'how' of the intensi fi cation, where Durand had to criticize Aquinas in order to promote the succession theory: he purely and simply eliminated it from redaction B, with the result that, as noted above, redaction B does not o ff er any explanation about the manner in which an intensi fi cation or remission takes place.\n\n103.

See above, fn. 97.\n\nOne manuscript of redaction B mentions this disappearance. BnF lat. 14454, f. 62 vb, at the end of d. 17 (after the question 'Utrum caritas possit minui'), has in the lower margin, apparently from the same hand as the main text, the following note: 'due questiones de fi ciunt hic, scilicet  utrum caritas augeatur per additionem aut alio modo et utrum possit augeri in in fi nitum.' Th is  note  does  not  result  from  a comparison made by the scribe with the text of redaction C, for the latter includes not just two more questions on the increase of charity than the non-C (i.e. redaction B) manuscripts have, but four more-and indeed many more as far as the whole distinction 17 is concerned. 106 Th e annotator of BnF lat. 14454, therefore, had a source of information other than a redaction C manuscript. Like Bernard Lombardi, he probably had access to redaction A and reported that these two questions were missing in Durand's revised version. It seems that all the elements fi t nicely in the scenario I have proposed.\n\nLet us now turn to the arguments ascribed to Durand by Bernard Lombardi.\n\nTh e fi rst argument is the 8 th fi nal objection in Hervaeus' Quodlibet II q. 13. It is formally identical to Godfrey's third argument ( G3 above), and James's third argument too ( J3 above):\n\nDBL1 : In all processes, the terminus a quo disappears when the terminus ad quem is reached. 107\n\nTh is argument is the cornerstone of Godfrey's position, and it is used by all of his followers, who also believe that intensi fi cation and remission are processes like any other process. Th ese limited alterations obey the laws that apply to all natural changes, therefore they must be seen\n\n106. See the chart in P errone ' s and R etucci ' s introduction, pp. 71*-73*. One should note, however, that the content of what is q. 6 in redaction C is part of q. 3 in redaction B. The count of the number of questions, by the way, may provide another confirmation that the extant non-C manuscripts of book I carry its redaction B version, not the redaction A version: see the Appendix, below.\n\n107. L ombardi , I Sent. ,  d. 17 q. 1, a. 1, mss. Leipzig Univ. 542 f. 37 ra, Erfurt CA 2° 368, f. 91 va-vb: 'Primo sic: secundum Aristotelem 5° Physicorum, habito termino ad quem terminus a quo abiicitur in omni motu . T unc sic: motus alterationis est unus motus, sed in isto motu forma remissa habet rationem termini a quo , forma intensa rationem termini ad quem; ergo adueniente gradu intenso remissus abiicitur .' H ervaeus N atalis , Quodl. II q. 13, f. 60 va, 8°: ' in omni motu abiicitur terminus a quo ; sed in motu intensionis terminus a quo est forma remissa ; igitur in tali motu forma remissa abiicitur , et per consequens non manet eadem cum intensa.'\n\nas a succession of transitory states between the initial and fi nal states of rest, which are contrary to each other and mutually exclusive. However, the conclusion of DBL1 talks of degrees , rather than forms, replacing each other. Recall that Durand, contrary to Godfrey, a ffi rmed that essences are divisible in degrees. Th is is why his theory is that of a succession of degrees, strictly speaking, instead of forms. Th e nuance is not always perceptible in Lombardi's account, but it will become much clearer in redaction C, as we'll see below.\n\nNext, Lombardi ascribes to Durand a con fi rmation of the previous argument,  which  is  identical  to  the  4 th fi nal  objection  in  Hervaeus' Quodlibet :\n\nDBL1' : Either a new degree succeeds to the previous one (instead of being an addition), which was to be demonstrated; or the previous one stays, and thus the form remains unchanged, which is false. 108\n\nTh e next argument of Durand reported by Lombardi, related to Godfrey's second argument ( G2 above), is identical to the 1 st fi nal objection in Hervaeus' Quodlibet :\n\nDBL2 : An agent that intensi fi es heat in a patient either acts and actualizes ('imprints') something in the patient, or not. Th e second alternative is impossible, because this would mean that nothing happens in reality. However, if the agent does act, it imprints something that was not there already, otherwise there would be no change either. But if what is imprinted is a new degree or form, the degree or form that was previously in the patient cannot subsist. 109\n\n108. L ombardi ,  Leipzig f. 37 ra, Erfurt f. 91 vb: 'Et confirmatur: si  intensum habet plus quam remissum, aut hoc est succedente gradu gradui, aut manente forma . Si primo modo habetur propositum quod sunt diuerse . Si secundo modo nulla erit uariatio , quod est falsum.' H ervaeus N atalis , Quodl. II q. 13, f. 60 va, 4°: 's i intensum habet plus quam remissum, aut est hoc succedente forma forme, aut manente eadem forma. Si primo modo, habetur propositum, scilicet quod intensum et remissum sunt diverse forme. Si secundo modo, tunc nulla est ibi variatio. '\n\n109. L ombardi , Leipzig f. 37 ra, Erfurt f. 91 vb: 'Secundo sic: intendens calorem aut aliquid imprimit aut nihil . Non potest dici quod nihil, quia per nihil calor non dicitur augmentari; ergo aliquid imprimit. Sed non illud quod iam erat. Ergo aliud.' H ervaeus N atalis , Quodl . II q. 13, f. 60 rb, 1°: 'agens intendens aut imprimit aliquid diuersum a precedente, aut non . Si non , igitur nulla variatio est in intensione, quod est contra sensum. Si sic , igitur forma intensa quam imprimit est diversa a precedente , et ex hoc ulterius sequitur quod ista remissa corrumpitur , quia due forme eiusdem speciei non simul sunt in eodem subiecto.'\n\nTh is argument is followed by a variant, which should be compared to James of Metz's 4th argument (J4 above), and is identical to the 7 th fi nal objection in Hervaeus' Quodlibet :\n\nDBL2' : Suppose that something cold diminishes heat in something else. Either the fi rst thing imprints something, or not. Th e second is impossible, because the agent does act. But what it imprints can only be a diminished heat, which cannot coexist with the initial heat. 110\n\nHowever, as we saw above, James eventually found that this argument entailed an unsolvable problem: it is impossible for the property actualized in the patient to be the opposite of that possessed by the agent, and both the Correctorium fratris Jacobi and Hervaeus in his Sentences commentary exploit the concession made by James ( NO2 and CR4 / NR4 above). Th e same objection to the succession theory fi gures also at  the  beginning of the second part of Hervaeus' Quodlibet II q.  13 (before the twelve fi nal objection), 111 with the discussion of counterarguments. One of these counter-arguments is that there is an order in which forms have to appear, with the consequence that a subject cannot change immediately from one extreme to the other but has to go through intermediaries. Th us, in the example above, cold cannot be introduced immediately in the patient; a less intense heat must be fi rst imprinted by the agent. Th is counter-argument seems to echo the econd solution envisioned by James, as we saw above, to solve the 'ras tio di ffi cilior' (the example given was that of the semen). 112 Hervaeus gives immediately three replies to this counter-argument:\n\n110. L ombardi , Leipzig f. 37 ra, Erfurt f. 91 vb: 'Vel potest sic formari ratio: frigidum remittens calidum aut aliquid imprimit aut nihil. Si imprimit aliquid, hoc non potest esse nisi calor remissus, quia si imprimeret intensum, tunc non remitteret primum sed intenderet, vel duo calores simul essent intensi , quod est falsum, sic autem non maneret calor intensus. Si autem nihil imprimeret, ergo nihil ageret quod est falsum.' H ervaeus N atalis , Quodl . II q. 13, f. 60 va, 7°: ' frigidum remittens calidum aut aliquid imprimit aut nihil. Si aliquid, hoc non potest esse nisi calor remissus, nec potest de nouo imprimere calorem remissum &lt; corr. ex intensum&gt; nisi remouendo calorem intensum &lt; corr. ex remissum&gt;, quia aliter duo calores simul essent . Si dicatur quod nihil imprimit, contra : quia si nihil imprimit, nihil agit , et sic agens remittens nihil agit.'\n\n111. Ff. 59vb - 60ra.\n\n- A univocal agent must be proportioned to its e ff ect; but cold is not suited to actualize heat, albeit a diminished heat at the fi rst stage of its action. - Is the more intense heat expelled in an instant or progressively? If the second, then some of the intense heat remains together with the less intense heat that is being introduced; but these forms belong to the same species and therefore cannot be numerically di ff erent and be in the same subject at the same time; therefore, they are in reality one and the same form. If, on the contrary, the more intense heat is expelled in an instant, then the diminished heat is introduced in an instant too, and this alteration is not continuous.\n\n- Likewise, is the very introduction of the lesser degree of heat successive or not? If not, this is contrary to empirical evidence. But if it is successive, does this lesser degree of heat, while it is being introduced, remain equal ( eque remissa ) or not? If yes, this again is contrary to empirical evidence. If not, then this means that the intensity of one and the same form can diminish. Th erefore, why couldn't this be extended to the whole process of remission (or intensi fi cation), from lesser heat to lesser heat?\n\nNow, the same discussion re-occurs at the end of Hervaeus' question, since, as we just saw, the 7 th objection to Hervaeus' position (identical to DBL2' in favor of the succession theory) reactivates James's argument ( J4 ). Th is reappearance of the problem con fi rms, I believe, that the series of the twelve fi nal objections is superadded and that a new opponent has entered the lists. 113\n\nTh e next argument attributed to Durand by Bernard is, like the 5 th and 6 th fi nal objections in Hervaeus' Quodlibet ,  a  direct attack on his own theory. Since Hervaeus thinks that degrees do not succeed each other, and do not add up cumulatively either (as in the addition theory), he has no other avenue left but saying that, in an intensi fi cation process, the degrees acquired do not complement the previous degrees like parts added to parts in order to constitute a new whole, but, rather, include them 'virtually' (this is also true of remission: the initial, higher degree being virtually contained in the lower degree too). As we saw, this notion of 'virtual inclusion' was already the linchpin of Hervaeus' solution in his Sentences commentary. All his  responses  to  arguments  supporting\n\nthe succession theory hinge on it too. 114 As already explained, the model Hervaeus o ff ered is that of nutrition: the nutrients are assimilated, but they remain distinct virtually or by habitus from the body, in the sense that they still could exist apart. 115 In his Quodlibet III q. 15, Th omas of Bailly challenged the appropriateness of this model, probably in reaction to Hervaeus' lecture on the Sentences . Nevertheless, in his Quodlibet II (before the fi nal twelve objections), Hervaeus retains the same solution. Th e intensi fi ed di ff ers from the remitted, he says, as being the same entity plus something else, not as if these were two actually distinguishable parts, but as a more perfect whole comprises a plurality. 116\n\nFrom DBL3 and the 5 th -6 th fi nal objections in Hervaeus' Quodlibet II ,  we  learn  that  Durand questioned the very principle of Hervaeus' solution, namely, that because their relation is a virtual inclusion, the initial degree and the fi nal degree of a quality do not di ff er really as two distinct entities do:\n\n114. See above, pp. 310, 317, at fn. 49 and 68. The same notion is also part of Hervaeus' defense against arguments in favor of the addition theory. For instance, the first objection in I Sent. , d. 17 q. 5, p. 96b, contends that if A is 'more' than B, A can be divided into two parts, the part that is equal to B and the part by which A exceeds B; but what can be divided into two parts must be constituted by the addition of these two parts. The conclusion, Hervaeus responds ( ad 1 m , p. 98a), is true only when the two parts can be distinguished in actuality, either by their subject or by their situs ; not so in the case of qualities, where the parts differ only virtualiter .\n\n116. F . 60 rb: 'Qualiter autem precedens et sequens sint unum vel etiam differant, dico sicut alius dixi, quod ipsum intensum differt a remisso precedente sicut ipsum habens et plus, non secundum partes singulares ita quod una possit signanter distingui ab alia, sed sicut totum perfectionale comprehendens aliqua, non sicut partes signabiles distinctas. Et de hoc posui duo exempla alibi. Primum est de conversione materiae alimenti in nutritum, ubi materia adveniens non potest signanter distingui a precedente. Et similiter quando pellis efficitur maior per extensionem, maioritas adveniens non potest distingui a precedente, et idem est si hoc fiat per rarefactionem, quia corpus rarefactum fit maius, et maioritas adveniens non potest distingui secundum quantitatem.' Note that Hervaeus says that he has already offered two examples elsewhere. The first one, nutrition, is in his Sentences commentary, as I just said. I don't know where else he offered the example of the stretching of a skin. However, this model is akin to that of rarefaction he used in his Sentences commentary (see above, fn. 49), because in both cases what is added cannot be distinguished in actuality from what it is added to.\n\n115. See above CR1 and CR1' , in the discussion of James of Metz by the Correctorium . H ervaeus , Sent. , p. 98a: '(…) si non fuisset praecedens habitus gradus, agens fecisset qualitatem aliam: sicut quando alimentum est conversum in illum qui nutritur, materia alimenti facta conversione, non est aliquid distinctum actu ab ista materia, sed habitu potest alia dici, quia si per se fuisset, habuisset per se distinctum.' See also H ervaeus , Quodl.

But  intensi fi cation  and  remission  are  completely  incompatible changes. Th erefore, the remitted form and the intensi fi ed form must be ncompatible too. As a consequence, they cannot be the same form. i 118\n\nTh e next argument too appeals to the principle of non-contradiction:\n\nDBL5 : In an intensi fi cation, one goes from the 'non esse intensum' to the 'esse intensum,' which are the two extremes of the change.

Th is would violate the principle of non-contradiction. 119\n\nA variant of this argument is identical to the 9 th fi nal objection in Hervaeus' Quodlibet II :\n\nDBL5' : A remission unfolds in the direction of the non-being of the form that is diminished. Correspondingly, an intensi fi cation moves away from this non-being. But this non-being precisely is the remitted form. Th e latter, therefore, cannot be the same form as the one that is acquired by the intensi fi cation. 120\n\nTh e  correspondence  between  these  eight  arguments  in  the  total  ascribed to Durand by Bernard Lombardi, and eight of the objections met by Hervaeus Natalis in his quodlibetal question shows su ffi ciently,\n\n119.

L ombardi , Erfurt f. 91vb: 'Vel formatur sic: sicut in remissione tenditur ad priuationem et ad non esse forme que remittitur, ita in intensione receditur a priuatione et a non esse forme que intenditur.

Sed in remissione tenditur ad non esse forme que acquiritur, et per consequens illa forma que acquiritur per intensionem non preexistebat, nec est eadem cum preexistente, nec per consequens cum forma remissa.' This argument may help illuminating the strange opening of John (Quidort) of Paris' Quodlibet I q. 8 (ed. A. H eiman , 'The First Quodlibet of Jean Quidort,' in: J.R. O'D onnell (ed.), Nine Mediaeval Thinkers. A Collection of Hitherto Unedited Texts, Toronto 1955, pp. 284-286). The question asked is: 'Utrum aliquid positivum possit produci a non ente.' John begins his reply with the explanation that the real question that was hiding behind the formulated question is whether a quality intensified is numerically the same as the remitted quality ('Ex verbis argumentis non apparebat ejus intentio; sed, ut dictum fuit mihi, intendit quaerere utrum qualitas intensa et remissa sit eadem numero vel diversa.') At first sight, the connection is not obvious (all the more that John does not directly respond to the question as formulated, but only to the background question and the classical arguments for the succession theory), but in the light of Durand's argument against Hervaeus, it makes sense that someone who roots for the succession theory would launch an attack on John by asking him whether the being of an intensified form can come from the non-being of that same form, assuming that numerically the same form remains along the process of intensification. Given that John's Quodlibet was held in 1304 or 1305, and clearly replies to Thomas of Bailly's Quodl. III q. 15 and his response to the infinity objection, this shows that the argument was in circulation before Durand's Parisian lectures on the Sentences .\n\nI  think,  that  Durand  was  involved  in  the  debate,  and  that  his  take on the intensi fi cation/remission problem before and around 1308 was close to the succession theory, even though Durand gave it a twist of his own. Lombardi's report points to Durand as the source of opposition at the end of Hervaeus' dispute; conversely, the historical plausibility of Durand disputing with Hervaeus validates Lombardi's report of Durand standing for the succession theory. Th e two presumptions reinforce each other, so to speak. Th is stage of Durand's thought can be known only indirectly (so far), and must have been contained in a question of the lost redaction A, that was left out of redaction B.\n\n## 6 . D urands ' R edaction C\n\nNow, Hervaeus Natalis did perhaps not argue totally in vain. Th e fi nal version of Durand's Sentences commentary seems to indicate that he somewhat changed his mind on the topic. Following Koch's conclusions, it  is  generally  held  that  in  redaction  C,  bishop  Durand, freed from the Dominican order's control, went back to the boldness of redaction A and reasserted his controversial theses. Th is may be mostly true, but it is not always the case. One example is Durand's position on the generation of the Son in the T rinity (book I, dist. 5). 121 Th e way in which intensi fi cation or remission occur is another case in point. Q. 7 of dist. 17, in redaction C, 'Utrum eadem forma possit esse intensa et  remissa,'  begins  with fi ve quod non arguments  for  the  succession theory, which are exactly those ascribed to Durand by Lombardi; but Durand is going to respond in the a ffi rmative and maintain that the same form remains along the process. Moreover, the sed contra repeats nearly  word  for  word  some  of  Hervaeus'  arguments  in  his Sentences commentary and his Quodlibet II! 122 Th is is why Bernard Lombardi's report on Durand's position cannot have been derived from redaction C: in the fi nal version, the arguments have been reshu ffl ed.\n\nNonetheless, in the end Durand still defends a form of the succession theory. But he has made a major adjustment-or clari fi cation. Let us see how.\n\n- 121. See F . R etucci , 'Selected problems…,' p. 95, fn. 51.\n\n122. The second argument of the sed contra comes from Quodl . II , f. 59 vb, the first one is the infinity problem (see NO1 above), the third one is the cooling down problem (see NO2 above).\n\nDurand breaks down the discussion into three questions: 1. Does an intensi fi ed form remain numerically one (nn. 10-12)? 2. If it remains numerically one, is it one because of a unity of indivisibility, or because of a unity of continuity (nn. 13-15)? 3. If it is because of a unity of continuity, are its parts distinguishable ( signabiles ) or not (nn. 16-39)?\n\n- 1. Durand immediately concedes that if the alteration by which a form is intensi fi ed is a real, i.e. continuous change, necessarily this form is numerically one. As a matter of fact, within one and the same process of change, four parameters, namely, the mobile, the duration, the form in fl ux ( forma fl uens ), and the end point of the change, must each be numerically the same. Otherwise, the alleged change would actually be a series of mutations. Th us, Durand clearly distances himself from Godfrey's or James's thesis of numerically distinct forms replacing each other. Th is is the essential modi fi cation introduced in redaction C, unless it is only a clari fi cation, since, as we saw above, there was in redaction A some ambiguity (at least according to Lombardi's report) on whether the degrees that succeed each other are taken to be distinct forms. Nonetheless, even if it is a mere clari fi cation, it amounts, from Godfrey's perspective, to a major concession to the opponents of his theory: one and the same form remains through the whole change.\n- 2. Next, however, Durand speci fi es that indivisibility is not the reason why the intensi fi ed form is one. Rather, the form is one by continuity. He argues that the intensi fi ed form cannot be indivisible because an indivisible cannot be acquired successively, but only at once ('tota simul'), whereas it is clear that an intensi fi cation or remission is progressive. Th erefore, an intensi fi able form must allow for parts or degrees  that  are  actualized  progressively.  Nonetheless,  the  numerical unity of this form is guaranteed by the continuity of the progress. Th e unity of the forma fl uens is the same as that of the change itself ( fl uxus formae ); but change is one by the continuity of its parts; therefore, the same must apply to the form that is acquired.\n\n3. So far, Durand has manifested not so much his disagreement with Hervaeus as with the older Th omist view (i.e., that of Giles of Rome and Godfrey), on which all forms are simple and indivisible entities. But how are these forms divisible? Here the di ff erence with Hervaeus becomes visible. For the latter, these forms are divisible into degrees that contain each other virtually, as we know. For Durand, they are divisible into degrees that succeed each other.\n\nDurand fi rst summarizes Hervaeus' answer: the intensi fi ed form differs from what it was previously by being what it was plus something more that it has acquired; however, these parts are not determinable ( signabiles ) parts, such that one can be distinguished from the other. 123 Durand harshly criticizes this idea. First, it contradicts Aquinas's doctrine, which it is supposed to defend, as Durand is happy to emphasize (and he certainly has a point, here). 124 It comes down to admitting that the intensi fi cation of the form happens by addition of something new, which is precisely what Aquinas disagreed with. Second, this idea is erroneous. An addition, or even more simply a composition, can happen only between things that are distinct by a distinction stronger that a distinction of reason. 125 But two accidents of the same kind cannot be in the same subject at the same time. Th ey cannot merge, because all forms are actuality, and actuality separates and distinguishes. Th ere would be a multiplication of qualities, instead of the augmentation of a  quality. 126 Ironically,  Durand  uses  fundamental  tenets  of  Aquinas's ontology against Hervaeus, self-proclaimed defender of the Th omistic orthodoxy. It is worth noting that Th omas of Bailly employs the same argument, and this might have been directed against Hervaeus, or at least against a theory that tries to explain how new degrees could coexist with previous degrees and somehow merge with them. 127\n\nAdmittedly, all this does not apply to nutrition, but this is precisely why nutrition cannot be a paradigm for the intensi fi cation/remission process, contrary to what Hervaeus claims. As opposed to forms, a part of matter doesn't distinguish itself from another part of matter (both being per se mere potentiality). Th is is why the matter of a nutrient can unite to the matter of the body. 128\n\n123. See above p. 310, and DBL3 , p. 332.\n\n125. Ibid ., n. 19, f. 59 va: 'realis additio est realiter diversorum.

Ibid .,  n.  20,  f.  59  va:  'Cum ergo omnis forma sit aliqua actualitas, impossibile est quod transeat in quodcumque nisi per sui corruptionem (…) Et causa est, quia actus distinguit et separat. Et ideo impossibile est quod actus adveniat actui si maneat quin sit res distincta et signabilis aliquo modo.' See A ristoteles , Metaphysics , book VII, chapter 13 (= recensio Guillelmi, 1039a7, AL 25.3.2, p. 159, l. 755): 'Actus enim separat'; cf. Auctoritates Aristotelis (ed. J. H amesse ), p. 130, n. 187 ('Actus separat et distinguit').\n\n128. I Sent. C, d. 17, q. 7, n. 20, f. 59 va.\n\n127. T homas de B ailly , Quodl. III q. 15, p. 211: 'ex pluribus in actu secundum quod huiusmodi, non fit unum.' I d ., Quodl. IV q. 11, p. 285: 'actus enim est per se distinguere et separare.'\n\nTh e other example given by Hervaeus, the stretching of skin, is inadequate as well. A greater extension results from the stretching, but not because a new quantity is added to the previous quantity. As in melting wax, the parts that beforehand were superposed now touch each other by their sides (this is why the skin or the wax become less dense and thinner). 129\n\nIn sum, Durand objects that if the fi rst  degrees  of  the  intensi fi ed form remain when new degrees are acquired, they will not be able to unite with each other, and the numerical unity of the form will not be preserved (an argument that could be directed against the addition theory as well). On this count too, Durand is on the same line as Th omas of Bailly, against Hervaeus. 130 Th e only solution, therefore, is that these parts replace each other in a succession. Paradoxically, the succession theory comes to the help of the numerical unity of the whole form.\n\nHow distinct are these degrees of a form? If by signabiles one means continuous parts that can co-exist together, then the degrees of a form are not signabiles , because it is impossible for the same form to be at the same time less intense and more intense, that is to say, to have simultaneously two degrees. In a broader sense, though, signabiles parts are parts that have real di ff erences: one is not the other, even though they are parts of a same whole numerically one-without, naturally, existing simultaneously. In that sense, the successive degrees in an intensi fi cation are the signabiles parts of one and the same form, which, with respect to the totality of the change process, is one by continuity of these parts. 131 (I am not sure, however, that this notion of parts or degrees of a form is any better de fi ned than in the addition theory.)\n\nTh us,  Durand keeps the idea of succession, even though for him there is corruption and replacement not of individual forms, but only of successive degrees within the same, numerically one form. Th is  is why, perhaps surprisingly at this point, he eventually o ff ers three arguments in favor of the succession thesis-two of which are traceable to redaction A, James of Metz, and Godfrey-followed by the answers that Hervaeus had given to each and by a rebuttal of these answers. 132\n\n129.

See ibid ., n. 39, f. 60 rb: 'T enendum est ergo quod forma&lt;e&gt; intensa&lt;e&gt; et remissa&lt;e&gt; acquisitae per motum possunt esse partes unius formae numero, et quae non est una indivisibilitate, sed continuitate suarum partium quae non sunt simul, sed successive et una superveniente alia desinit esse et hoc modo signari possunt.'\n\n130. See T homas de B ailly Quodl. III q. 15, p. 216.\n\n132.\n\nIbid\n\n., nn. 26-38, f. 60 ra-rb.\n\nTh e fi rst argument is identical to G3 J3 DBL1 / / : 'In omni motu terminus a quo abiicitur et terminus ad quem acquiritur.' Hervaeus had answered that in an intensi fi cation the terminus a quo is not the form itself, but the privation of the perfection that constitutes the terminus ad quem ; obviously, this privation is eliminated, but this does not mean that the form is eliminated too and has to be replaced by another. 133 Th is reply, Durand objects, is worthless. His fi rst two objections emphasize the fact that the intensi fi cation process acts on the preexisting form, not on the privation. 134 His third reason is that the terminus a quo of an intensi fi cation is the terminus ad quem of a remission, and this terminus ad quem cannot be a privation, but has to be an existing form.\n\nTh e  second  argument  is  identical  to G2 J2 DBL2 / / :  the  agent  must imprint  something  other  than  what  existed  beforehand.  Hervaeus  had answered that the agent makes the form that existed beforehand more perfect; the result is only a di ff erence between the less perfect and the more perfect, not of a di ff erence between two forms. 135 As we saw with DBL2 , Durand objects that this argument is inconsistent with Hervaeus' own affi rmations. Hervaeus argued that in nutrition, the matter of the nutrient does not just perfect the matter of the body, but is added to it. According to the parallel drawn by Hervaeus himself, the intensi fi ed form should likewise not just perfect the previous form, but be added to it (or a new degree be added to the same form in a lesser degree). Moreover, if the agent does not actualize anything new, it makes the patient more perfect while doing nothing, which is absurd. 136 Th e perfection is nothing but the form; if some perfection is added, this means that the essence is modi fi ed. 137\n\nTh e third argument reiterates the fundamental principle that a variation in perfection is a variation of the essence, which entails that an intensi fi ed or remitted form is not the same form that existed before. 138 Hervaeus replied that the form remains what it is, even though the form as more intense contains more perfection than the same form\n\n133. See CR3 NR3 / above, p. 316, and H ervaeus , Quodl. II q. 13, ad 8 m , f. 61 ra.\n\n135. See CR2 NR2 / above, p. 318, and H ervaeus , Quodl. II q. 13, ad 5 m and ad 6 m , ff. 60 vb - 61 ra.\n\n134.

Ibid ., n. 36, f. 60rb: '(…) essentia essentialiter variata non est eadem essentia (…) ergo forma intensa et remissa non sunt eadem essentia.'\n\nas less intense. Durand becomes caustic here. Th is response is evasive, frivolous,  and  purely  verbal,  he  says. 139 Again,  the  perfection  of  the form is equivalent to the very essence of the form; modifying one is modifying the other. Here too, Durand may have taken note of Bailly's earlier rebuttal of Hervaeus. 140\n\nHowever, after this development that might pass for an unconditional defense of Godfrey's theory, Durand takes care to give his considered position on the succession thesis, in response to the opening arguments of the whole question (the fi ve arguments that were reported by Lombardi as being Durand's own and are now in the quod non ):\n\n' Th e main arguments submitted to establish that a remitted form and an intensi fi ed form are not numerically the same, must be accepted insofar as they prove that the intensi fi ed form and the remitted form exclude each other, like the parts of a successive continuity (…) but they do not prove that the total form of which they are parts is not numerically one by continuity.' 141\n\nIn other words, Durand continues to endorse the argumentative core of the succession theory, but makes clear that he places the succession within the same form, as a succession of degrees of intensity of that form (a succession, not an accumulation or addition of degrees), rather than between fullyfl edged individual forms. Again, this may be a mere clari fi cation of what he was already writing in redaction A or objecting to Hervaeus at the time of the latter's Quodlibet II , although nothing in the extant texts or testimonies clearly con fi rms this possibility. Alternatively, it may be an important modi fi cation, due to Hervaeus' or others' criticisms.\n\nNonetheless,  because  he  endorses  a  form  of  succession,  Durand has to respond to the objections raised against the tenets of Godfrey's theory,  even  though  these  responses  must  be  understood  within  the framework of Durand's own solution.\n\n139.

To the in fi nity objection: 142 Just as in any motion and any continuum there is an in fi nity of parts in potentiality, likewise, in a form that is intensi fi ed there is an in fi nity of partial forms which, by their continuity, compose the total form that is acquired by the totality of the motion.\n- 2. To the discontinuity objection: 143 Th e remitted form that was in the subject before the beginning of change is expelled in an instant, but the next form is introduced not in an instant, but progressively.\n- 3. To  the  active  agent  objection: 144 Th e  cold  that  diminishes  heat does imprint something; it does not do so just by itself, however, but with the heat which co-acts and preserves the diminished degree of heat.\n\n## C onclusion\n\nTh e previous pages have depicted the liveliness of some of the debates about the intensi fi cation/remission of forms at the very beginning of the 14 th century. Even though the topic seems today obscure and idle, it was obviously of great interest to the medievals, since they did not hesitate to return to it tirelessly and were keen on criticizing each other's errors on the matter. Th e in fl uence of Godfrey of Fontaines has been highlighted. Hervaeus did all he could to push back against it, but James of Metz and Th omas of Bailly, among others, spread his thesis. Durand too defended it against Hervaeus, and I have shown that he probably did so directly as an interlocutor in Nédellec's second Quodlibet , in concordance with a question of the fi rst redaction of his Sentences commentary, which has now disappeared but is echoed by Bernard Lombardi. Durand's considered position in the third redaction of his Sentences commentary, however, is unique. Even though some of his views seem close to Bailly's, in the end his theory is quite di ff erent. For Bailly, as for Godfrey, there is no doubt that the intensi fi ed form does not remain numerically the same, and that each degree corresponds to a distinct form which is actualized and then eliminated as long as the process goes on. 145 By contrast,\n\n142. See NO1 above, p. 314.\n\n144. See NO2 above, p. 315.\n\n143. See CO1 above, p. 314.\n\n145. See T homas de B ailly , Quodl. III q. 15, 4 th argument, p. 210: 'Ergo patet quod illa  forma  secundum  quam  est  motus  est  alia  et  alia  realiter  secundum  diuersas  partes motus, que tamen non possunt esse simul; adueniente secunda corrumpitur prima (…).'\n\nDurand o ff ers a sort of compromise, in which he abandons Godfrey's most controversial claim, namely, that the same form does not remain throughout its intensi fi cation or remission. He seems to have accepted some of the criticisms that had been addressed to Godfrey's theory. Nevertheless, Durand uses Godfrey's, James's, and Bailly's arguments to support his own view of a succession of degrees in the same form.\n\nIn closing, it is worth mentioning a fact that highlights Durand's infl uence within the Dominican order despite the troubles he ran into. At the end of his account of Durand's position, Bernard Lombardi confesses that the succession theory once strongly appealed to him and that he eventually rejected it only for a theological reason that involves the transubstantiation  dogma. 146 Furthermore,  the  next  article  of  Lombardi's question (art. 2: 'Que est causa precisa susceptionis magis et minus'), is, as I noted above, 147 nothing but the transcription, word for word, of Durand's q. 6 in redaction C. 148 As in the case of James of Lausanne, 149 one of the Dominicans who was supposed to be Durand's nemesis does not hesitate to copy him from start to fi nish, just short of presenting him as an authority on the question. Th is fact may encourage us to look more carefully at Durand's very special place in the Dominican order. 150\n\n146.

Bernard refers to an earlier passage of the question (Leipzig f. 37rb): 'Istam opinionem [i.e. Durandi] non teneo propter unam rationem que sit de speciebus in sacramento altaris que talis est: variatis speciebus in acramento altaris secundum numerum desinit ibi esse corpus Christi.

Rather, as the explicit of the Additiones themselves states, they are additions to the 'lecture' that Durand 'copied and composed in Paris.'\n\n151. J. K och , Durandus ,  pp.  44-49. Cf. N icolaus M edensis (D urandellus ), Evidentiae contra Durandum , ed. P .T . S tella , Tübingen 2003, vol. 1, p. 56 (NB: W. D uba , 'Aristotle in Hell and Aquinas in Heaven: Hugo de Novocastro, OFM and Durandus de Aureliaco OP ,' in: Bulletin de Philosophie Médiévale 56 [2014], pp. 183-194, has recently proposed to re-identify re-identify Durandellus with Durand of Aurillac).\n\n153.

See p. 47 the criterion used by Koch: redaction C contains questions taken from the Quodlibet held by Durand in Avignon in 1314: I Sent. C, d. 17 q. 1 = Quodl. Aven . I q. 6; d. 33 q. 1 = in part Quodl. Aven. I q. 1. These two questions are present in the first part or main text of BnF Lat. 15364. Therefore, this text offers right away redaction C, and the Additiones are not additions to an earlier version. Moreover, the preface of the main text mentions Durand's presence in Avignon as a past fact.\n\n## Here is the full passage:\n\n/91ra/ Expliciunt tituli 61 correctorii qui sunt additiones et declarationes Magistri Durandi ordinis predicatorum doctoris venerabilis, quos super lecturam suam Sententiarum addidit quam Parisius copiavit et compilavit. Unde 100 et 9 et 61 faciunt 170, et tot sunt questiones summatim primi Durandi. Unde primus Durandi habet centum et septuaginta questiones.\n\nNonetheless, it is correct that the main text, to which the Additiones are appended, o ff ers the text of redaction C, minus the said additions. All in all, the total content of the manuscript looks to be that of redaction C, once the additions are inserted in their de fi nitive place. Why, then, are we told that the Additiones are additions to an earlier version? It is as if the content of redaction C of book I had been broken down: fi rst the questions that have a match in the questions that Durand had discussed  in  Paris,  then  the  questions  that  have  on  the  contrary  no match, and therefore are additional questions compared to the Parisian lectures. In other words, the layout dismembers redaction C and distinguishes what corresponds, at least formally, to the Paris lectures, and what is only in redaction C. When one of the questions has its equivalent in the Paris lectures, the main text gives the redaction C version of that question; when one of them has not been discussed in Paris, the main text refers to the Additiones , saying that one will fi nd below the text of that question (in its C version too). 154\n\nLet us see what this system reveals about distinction 17. At the end of the main text of book I (f. 65va-66va), one fi nds the complete list of the questions contained in redaction C, which is repeated at the beginning of the Additiones (f. 67ra-vb). I transcribe in italics the titles of the questions of dist. 17 that are present in the fi rst part or main text of the manuscript (f. 28vb to 31ra), that is to say, the topics that had been discussed in the Parisian lectures. I transcribe in normal font the ques-\n\n154. It is worth noting that the manuscript is rather carefully written and amended, once belonged to the College of Sorbonne, and has traces of the pecia system. Its peculiar composition must have served a purpose. Perhaps the Additiones were first a self-standing compendium of the questions that were in redaction C but not in the Paris lectures, and were available in other manuscripts; then, someone who wanted to have the full text of redaction C had the other questions of redaction C copied and placed first, with references to the already existing Additiones as a complement .\n\ntions contained in the Additiones , that is to say, the questions that are additional in the third version by comparison with the Paris lectures.\n\n## &lt;1&gt; Utrum necessarium sit caritatem esse habitum creatum in homine ad hoc quod homo sit Deo carus\n\n- &lt;2&gt; Utrum necessarium sit ponere caritatem habitualem ad hoc ut possumus aliquid mereri apud Deum &lt;cf. f. 29ra: Quere infra istam questionem  = Add. f. 80ra-80va&gt;\n- &lt;3&gt; Utrum caritas detur secundum proportionem naturalium\n- &lt;4&gt; Utrum ille qui est in caritate possit cognoscere certitudinaliter se habere caritatem &lt;= Add. f. 80va-vb&gt;. 155\n- &lt;5&gt; Utrum caritas possit augeri 156\n- &lt;6&gt; Que sit causa suscipiendi magis et minus &lt;cf. f. 30rb: Ista questio patet infra = Add. f. 80vb-81rb&gt;\n- &lt;7&gt; Utrum eadem forma numero possit esse intensa et remissa sive suscipere magis et minus &lt; cf. f.30rb: Ista questio aliter patet infra = Add. f. 81rb-82rb&gt;\n- &lt;8&gt; Utrum caritas augeatur per quemlibet actum &lt;cf. f.30rb: Ista etiam invenies infra = Add. f. 82rb-82va&gt;\n- &lt;9&gt; Utrum possit augeri in in fi nitum &lt;cf. f.30rb: Istam cum aliis tribus invenies infra secundum ordinem scriptas = Add. 82va-82vb&gt; &lt;10&gt; Utrum caritas possit diminui .\n\nTh ese ten questions are indeed present in redaction C as we know it from other manuscripts and the printed editions. Let us subtract the questions in normal font. Th is leaves four questions (in italics), which are therefore, according to the explicit of the Additiones , the only ones that  Durand discussed in Paris. Th ese  are  exactly  the  four  questions that are found in all the non-C manuscripts of book I. Th erefore, the non-C manuscripts give us a text that is at least structurally identical to the version that Durand had reworked in Paris, i.e. redaction B. Might\n\n155. The reference to the Additiones is missing in the main text.\n\n156. This question is in fact absent in the main text (and is not in the Additiones either). Its omission is easily explainable. This question is supposed to be the first of the second part of the distinction ('de caritatis augmento,' qq. 5-10). When finishing the first part of the distinction ('de necessitate caritatis,' qq. 1-4), the scribe jumped by homoeoteleuton to the 'Ad secundum' that introduces the second question of the second part, i.e. q. 6, f. 30rb.\n\nthey nevertheless transmit redaction A, in case Durand had not issued a  redaction  B  of  book  I,  as  Koch  believed?  No,  because  one  of  the non-C manuscripts indicates that two questions are missing in dist. 17, and this cannot be by comparison with redaction C, since there are six additional questions in redaction C, not two (see above, p. 327). Th erefore, it has to be by comparison with redaction A. Th us, redaction A was di ff erent from redaction B, since in redaction B dist. 17 has four questions, whereas in redaction A it comprised six questions (the four of redaction B plus the two reported as missing). Conclusion: the non-C manuscripts of book I contain redaction B. As a consequence, we do not have direct access to redaction A of book I.",

Despite the doubt cast by Anneliese Maier, it has been recently demonstrated that Godfrey of Fontaines did set forth this theory in the 1290s.  Still more 1 recently, Brian Conolly has shown that Dietrich of Freiberg too had defended a similar solution.  With the present contribution, I would 2 like to add James of Metz and Durand of Saint-Pourçain to the list of those who upheld, albeit with some perplexity, the succession theory before Burley.  I also document that James and Durand bear witness to 3 Godfrey's in fl uence on some Dominicans at the beginning of the 14 th century, as they receive the principles and arguments that support the theory directly from him. On the other hand, Hervaeus Natalis and some other Dominicans tried to counter this in fl uence and the criti-\n\n- 1. See J. C éleyrette - J.-L.

A number of texts echo the lively debates  that  ensued. Th us,  the  question  of  intensi fi cation/remission opens a window on the complex intellectual situation of the Dominican order in Paris in the fi rst decade of the 14 th century.\n\n## 1 . T he C ompeting T heories\n\nBefore proceeding, it will be useful to review the main positions, each of which is best understood with reference to the others.\n\nTh ree theories in the Middle Ages were competing to explain processes such as a thing becoming warmer, or whiter, or a soul becoming more virtuous-in brief, what is known as the augmentation and diminution of qualities, and, because the magnitudes in question are intensive magnitudes, is more aptly called intensi fi cation or remission of qualities. 4\n\nA. Th e addition theory, popular among the Franciscans, rests on the principle that intensi fi cation and remission are like augmentation or diminution inasmuch as they can happen only in wholes where parts can be distinguished and added to or subtracted from each other. Bonaventure, Richard of Menneville (Mediavilla), Olivi, and Duns Scotus all say that forms that intensify acquire something really new which is added to what they already had, that is to say, a new degree is added to the degrees previously contained in the essence of those forms, and constitutes with them a new whole.\n\nTh e  problem  with  this  theory  may  be  that  these  degrees  or  parts of  essence  that  can  be  dissociated  or  welded  together  do  not  have  a clearly de fi ned ontological status. What does it mean for an essence to be divisible into parts that, obviously, are not its 'subjective' or logical parts such as genus or speci fi c di ff erence? Greater whiteness or greater\n\n4. See A. M aier , 'Das Problem der intensiven Grösse,' in: ead ., Zwei Grundprobleme der Scholastischen NaturPhilosophie , 3 rd ed., Rome 1968, pp. 3-43; J.-L. S olère , 'Plus ou moins: le vocabulaire de la latitude des formes,' in: J. H amesse - C.

What are, on the other hand, these parts of an essence which can be acquired or lost, and which are therefore not essential?\n\nB.  On  the  opposite  side, Th omas  Aquinas  upholds  the  principle that forms are indivisible (other than logically), and therefore cannot undergo any change. 5 Th is principle has a Neoplatonic ring to it and was indeed transmitted by Boethius in his commentary on Aristotle's Categories . Accordingly, Boethius' response to the question of intensifi cation is that, since essences in themselves cannot change, only the qualia , that is, participations in a quality Q , can be more or less q , while Q in itself is not modi fi ed. 6 Th omas follows suit and argues along the same lines: di ff erences in intensity cannot a ff ect the nature of the form that goes through this kind of change. Th erefore, a qualitative variation has to come from an extrinsic factor, which can only be the way in which this form is received in a subject. William of Peyre of Godin, an in fl uential Dominican towards the end of the 13 th century (he   probably lectured on the Sentences in Paris in 1299-1300), faithfully summarizes Aquinas's theory in his Lectura Th omasina :\n\n- […] &lt;caritas&gt;  augetur  per  intensionem  vel  secundum  accessum  ad  terminum sicut qualitates prime. Circa quod notandum quod est augmentum primarum qualitatum ex causis suis, scilicet agente et recipiente. Ex agente autem in quantum ipsum agens per formam suam intendit reducere   ipsum patiens de potentia in actum sue forme quantum possibile est sibi. Sicut autem non-calidum est in potentia calidum, ita minus calidum est in potentia respectu magis calidi; unde sicut per actionem calefaciendi e ffi citur aliquid de non-calido calidum, non quia ponatur ibi alius [ms. aliquis]    calor,  sed  quia  calor  qui  est  in  potentia  reducitur  in  actum,  ita etiam de minus calido e ffi citur magis calidum inquantum educitur calor qui erat in minus calido ut actus imperfectus in maiorem perfectionem et\n- 5.

'Sed hoc solum dicere possumus magis habere sanitatem aliquem, id est esse saniorem, et magis sanum, et minus sanum. Dicimus ergo quod ipsae quidem qualitates non suscipiunt magis et minus' ( In Categorias Aristotelis, III, PL 64, 257 C). Aristotle himself left unanswered this question that he raised in the Categories , namely, whether the qualities or the qualia are susceptible of being more or being less what they are ( Cat . 8, 10b 30 - 11a 2).\n\nassimilationem agentis. Et hoc contingit etiam in minus calido ex parte subiecti secundum quod subiectum quod est in potentia et indeterminatum ad multa magis ac magis unitur et determinatur sub actu illo quod actingit&lt;ur&gt; in subiecto illo, secundum quod disponitur dispositione magis convenienti illi actui, secundum quam dispositionem sit susceptibilis illius actus et magis subicitur, sicut cum dyafanitas sit congrua dispositio ad  luminis  receptionem,  quanto  ergo  aer  plus  attenuatur  tanto  plus  sit dispositus et susceptior luminis […] Aduertendum ulterius quod quedam sunt forme que in natura sua habent partes, sicut quantitas et sciencia que habent partes  penes  aliam;  quedam  autem  non  habent  partes,  ut  calor, caritas et omnes qualitates que sunt in tertia specie qualitatis, et tales augentur per maiorem dispositionem subiecti […]. 7\n\nTh is  theory  sees  intensi fi cation  and  remission  as  a  particular  case  of alteration: a limited alteration that stays within the limits of a given species of quality instead of totally removing that quality and bringing about its contrary.  As a consequence, it must be understood in the same 8 terms as a wholesale alteration, that is, as the progressive   actualization of the form of the agent in the patient. Th e process is the same whether it is from one contrary to another (for instance, from black to white), or from a lesser actuality of this form to a greater actuality (for instance, from a less intense white to a more intense white). Th is  process can also be described as an ' accessus ad terminum ,'  in which the form gets 9 closer and closer to a maximum of actualization (or the opposite of it). Th e  actualization  of  the  form  in  the  patient  can  vary  either  because of the action of the agent becoming stronger or weaker (as when one moves away from, or closer to, a source of heat), or, supposing that the action of the cause is uniform, because of a di ff erence in the disposition of the receiving subject (at the same distance from the source of heat, a wet item will be heated less easily than a dry one; or, as Godin submits, air becomes more luminous when it gets thinner, while the illumination by the sun remains the same).\n\n- 7.

See the analysis of alteration in A ristoteles , Physica , V.2, 226b 1-2.\n\nHowever, Aquinas's response is not entirely satisfying. He contends that to be more 'established' or 'rooted' in a subject means, for an accidental form, to augment 'in essence' ( essentialiter ). But this does not account su ffi ciently for canonical expressions such as 'charity deserves to be augmented' ( caritas  meretur augeri ),  which seems to imply that charity itself can be intensi fi ed, and not just that an immutable form of charity can become more established in a soul, or is more participated in that soul. 10 Th e inherence of an accidental form in a subject certainly can increase or decrease, but inherence is a property that is common to all accidents and is di ff erent from their quidditative content or speci fi c nature. What we want to be able to say is that the quidditative content itself aries, not just the 'being in' of the form; and what we want to know is v why certain accidental forms only (those of the third kind of qualities) 11 can be intensi fi ed and diminished, and not the others, whereas all are 'in' a subject. Must not this be related to their intrinsic nature?\n\nWe shall see that,  as  a  result  of  this  problem  with  Aquinas's  solution, some self-styled followers of Aquinas such as Hervaeus Natalis are inclined to admit a 'latitude' within intensi fi able forms. 12 Th ese forms must have a certain margin of indetermination to make possible their being participated in more or less by the subjects in which they are received. Th e novel point is that the variation in reception is conditioned not only by the receptivity of the subject, but also by this relative indetermination of the form, instead of the form being absolutely rigid and not modi fi able. Th is represents a departure from Aquinas's original position, even though Aquinas himself seems to say as much in a few texts. 13\n\nC. On the other hand, other followers of Aquinas on this count strictly maintain the absolute determination and immutability of the forms. Th is  is  the  case  with  both  Giles  of  Rome  and  Godfrey  of  Fontaines. For Giles, the esse of  the  form  can  vary  (in  accordance  with  the  way it is received in a subject), while its essence remains what it is without\n\n10. The expression comes from Augustine and Alypius, Epist. 186 ( ad Paulinum ), 3.10 (CSEL t. 57, p. 53). It is most often adduced in discussions about charity in commentaries on d. 17 of book I of Peter Lombard's Sententiae , which is the locus classicus for theologians to discuss the intensification/remission of qualities.\n\n- 12.

Naturally, they are tokens of the same species or nature; but each is a di ff erent 'individual contraction' of that nature, as Godfrey puts it. Each form is in itself non-intensi fi able and represents a fi xed degree of a quality. When they succeed each other, a variation in degree occurs, each being more intense (or less) than the previous one. 15 However, the introduction of a new form or degree presupposes that the previous one is destroyed, since two forms of a same species cannot be actualized at the same time in the same subject; nor can the new one merge with the previous one or combine with it. Consequently, the apparent   continuous increase or decrease of one and the same quality is in fact, for Godfrey, a series of instantaneous replacement of one form by another of the same species but of a di ff erent intensity, that is to say, a series of corruptions and generations of di ff erent accidents. T ransitory forms unceasingly succeed each other in the same subject until the end of the process.\n\nAs  I  will  show  in  the  following  pages,  Godfrey's  solution  was favorably  received  by  James  of  Metz  and  Durand  of  Saint-Pourçain as an alternative to both Giles' theory and Godin's mere repetition of Aquinas. Th is led them to steer away from the o ffi cial Th omistic orthodoxy sought by the Dominican order, and triggered the intervention of Hervaeus Natalis (even though he himself was not completely faithful to Aquinas, as noted above and as we will see again below).\n\n## 2 .

T wo di ff erent actions must have two di ff erent end points. 16 For instance, as Aristotle remarks, the health (which is an accidental form) restored after a disease is not the same health that was had before the disease, because each of them results from a di ff erent action. 17 Now, if we warm up something to a certain degree of heat, stop for a moment, then warm it up again to a higher degree, two actions have been successively carried out. Th erefore, two di ff erent end points have been successively reached; two forms have been successively actualized.\n\nTh is is to say that the second degree is not the fi rst degree intensi fi ed, but another form, distinct from the fi rst one.

S chabel , 'James of Metz's Lectura on the Sentences ,' p. 355).\n\nother manuscripts of James's work re fl ect   another version of this secunda lectura . I will rely mostly on the T royes   manuscript, which, with its Additiones , o ff ers a fuller picture of James's thinking about the intensi fi cation and remission of qualities.\n\nOn that topic, James's main target in book I, d. 17, p. 2, q. 1, is Giles of Rome. However, he signi fi cantly departs from Aquinas's position too, insofar as Giles and Th omas, while they think that in general essences cannot vary in any way, both make an exception for those that derive their species from something to which they are related. Th e argument brought up by Giles to make room for this sole exception is directly borrowed from Aquinas. So when James criticizes this argument, it is in e ff ect a passage of the Summa Th eologiae (I II a ae , q. 52, art.1) that he is taking to task. No type of accidental form has a special status, he objects, and what is said of one must be said of the others. If some accidental forms cannot vary in essence by intensi fi cation, none can. But this is belied by obvious examples, including motion. Conversely, if some accidental forms can have a variation in essence, then all can, contrary to Th omas's and Giles's claim.\n\nIn the next question (q. 2), James turns to the way in which intensi fi cation or remission are carried out. After fi rst gainsaying the addition theory with the standard argument that no addable or subtractable distinct parts can be isolated in an essence, and then presenting a theory of Th omistic inspiration which might be Th omas of Sutton's, James introduces Godfrey's theory of succession and supports it with four arguments.\n\nTh e fi rst one is directly borrowed from Godfrey's own fi rst argument. It rests on the relation between an action and the terminus of the action:\n\n- J1 : Any new action, and therefore any augmentation or remission, has a new end point, that is to say, results in the actualization of a new form, which presupposes the corruption of the previous form; hence, the process is a succession of di ff erent forms. 24\n\nHowever, James develops this argument in an interesting way. Th e end point of an intensi fi cation or remission is either an essence, or some esse , or a mode of being (this tripartite division is supposed to exhaust all the possibilities). 25\n\n- 24. Ms. Troyes Bibl. Munic. 992 (hereafter T) f. 45ra l. 42 - f. 45 rb l. 19.\n- 25. In this question James again principally targets Giles of Rome.\n\n- a) If the end point of the action is a new essence, either the previous essence has been corrupted, which is what had to be proven, or it has not been corrupted. If the second, then the previous essence remains while the new end point is acquired. Th is new end point must be aggregated to the essence previously held, because two essences of the same kind cannot coexist in the same subject. Th erefore, the augmented nature has parts and is not simple-which cannot be admitted.\n- b) If the end point of the action is a new esse (which is speci fi cally Giles's view),  the  same  demonstration  ensues:  either  this esse subsists  together with the new esse of the acquired form, but this is impossible because the esse of a form must be as simple as its essence is; or the esse of the initial form is destroyed, and so its essence is destroyed too, QED.\n- c)  If  the  end  point  is  a  mode  of  being  ( modus essendi )  of  the  form,  two alternatives branch out. First, this mode might be something absolute, that is, a form. But then, by the same reasoning as before, the previous mode must be corrupted, and so why not admit that the previous form itself (not just its mode) is corrupted? Or, second, one might claim that this mode is something   relative. But this is impossible because the intensi fi cation or remission, which is a real action, cannot have for its end point something which is not absolute.\n\n## James's second argument rephrases Godfrey's second argument:\n\n- J2 : In any change whatsoever, and at every instant, that according to which there is change is always di ff erent. For instance, in a local motion the place ( ubi ) of the body in motion is constantly di ff erent. But that according to which there is change is always a form; such is the case for the ubi , or for a quality of the third kind in an intensi fi cation/remission. In fact, any change whatsoever always involves a modi fi cation of one of the forms that the subject of the change has. Whereas the subject itself remains the same through an accidental change, one of its accidental forms varies, and this is why the subject can be said to be now otherwise than it was. But if the accidental form is modi fi ed, it has to become radically other, because this form is the instantiation  of  a  certain  essence,  and  as  such  is  simple. Th is  particular form is the quality obtaining in a certain degree, and another degree has to\n\nbe another form, another instantiation of the same quality. Th erefore, the previous form must be corrupted and a new one introduced. 26\n\nJames's third argument rests on the nature of change itself, in accordance with Godfrey's third argument:\n\n- J3 : In any change whatsoever, the initial condition ( terminus a quo ) and the end point ( terminus ad quem ) must be di ff erent and cannot occur simultaneously: the very nature of change is the passing from one to the other, the subject leaving the initial condition to acquire a new state. Th erefore, the same form cannot obtain at the start and at the end of the change. 27\n\nTh e Additions of the Troyes manuscript o ff er a fourth argument, described  as  'trickier'  ( di ffi cilior ).  Let  us  note fi rst  that  this  argument seems to be James's creation, and second that it is found only in the version of the secunda lectura given by the T royes Additions, and not in the other manuscripts of the secunda lectura .\n\n- J4 : Suppose that a fi re just starts warming up water. Th is is the very beginning of an alteration, but no form of heat is actualized yet, for if one immediately stops the process, the water is still cold, and the form coldness cannot coexist with the form of heat (we'll get back to this point momentarily). However, the fi re did act, and therefore did cause something in the water. Th e only possibility left is that it caused a lesser coldness, rather than some heat. But this lesser coldness cannot be the initial form of coldness that would have been simply diminished, because such weakening would only  be  a  privation,  whereas  the  action  of  the fi re,  which  is  a  real  and positive action, must have a positive result. Th ence, one must conclude that the fi re actualized a new form, which is a token of coldness at a lesser degree. Th is,  in  turn,  implies  that  the  initial  form  of  coldness  has  been destroyed, for the reasons we saw above. 28\n\nHowever, one might ask, why would cold and heat not be able to coexist in the same subject? James notes that some people maintain that this is\n\n26. T f. 45 rb l. 19-29. Cf. C. S chabel , 'Place, space, and the physics of grace,' pp.\n\n28. T f. 16 rb l. 13-37.\n\n127-130. 27. T f. 45 rb l. 29-35.\n\nnot impossible if cold and heat are not in their maximum degrees, but are each in an intermediary degree. 29 But he rejects this idea. Even if cold and heat are attenuated qualities and are not maximally contrary to each other, they have respectively the status of terminus a quo and ad quem and are therefore incompatible in the same instant. Th is again is  the  thrust  of  Godfrey's  second  argument:  the  two    limits  ( termini ) of change, the starting point and the end point, cannot   coexist. Th e fi rst state of a ff airs must have ceased to exist before the second can be reached. In other words, the fi rst form must be destroyed for another one to be actualized.\n\nIn a somehow endearing manner, James does not rest his case but raises four doubts about the theory he has just defended, and in the end candidly admits he has no response for one of them, namely the di ffi culty that arises from the fourth argument I have just presented. Th e problem with the idea that, by a brief application of heat to cold water, a diminished cold succeeds to a more intense cold, is that it looks absurd that something hot should cause coldness, albeit a diminished one. Something hot can only actualize heat, because every agent produces something similar to itself. James envisions two ways of solving this di ffi culty. 30\n\nTh e fi rst way distinguishes between production of the last e ff ect of a process and production of an intermediary e ff ect, that is a step towards the last e ff ect. An example of this is the production of sperm, which precedes  the  production  of  the  end  e ff ect,  a  new  living  being. Th is example is supposed to show that it is possible for an agent (a living being) to produce fi rst, as an intermediary e ff ect, an e ff ect that does not resemble it (the sperm, which is not a living being), before producing the end e ff ect, which does resemble it (another living being). Likewise, heat may begin its action by producing something opposite to its nature (remitted coldness), provided that this is only a step towards the end of the action, which is to cause heat in the water. James, however is reluctant to accept this solution. It de fi es our imagination, he says, to admit that heat could cause coldness in any way whatsoever.\n\n- 29. This is what D uns S cotus , for instance, objects against Godfrey in Ordinatio , l. I, d. 17 pars 2, q. 2, in: Opera Omnia , t. V , Vatican 1959, § 242, p. 255.\n\n30. T f. 16 rb l.60 - 16 va l.44. Cf. I ohannes D uns S cotus , Ordinatio , l. I, d. 17 pars 2, q. 1, in: Opera Omnia , t. V , Vatican 1959, § 212, p. 243. We will review below another difficulty raised by James, together with the objection made by the Correctorium fratris Iacobi Metensis (see, below, CO1 , p. 314).\n\nTh e second way relies on the idea that two agents, one hot and the other cold, for instance fi re and air, can act on the same patient and produce one shared e ff ect. Th us, the fi re heats the water while the surrounding air cools it down, and their common e ff ect that is fi rst produced is a diminished coldness, because at that moment the action of the air is still more powerful than the action of the fi re. In this process, the fi re produces nothing but heat; but the action of the air explains that the result is for now only a diminished coldness. However, James rejects this solution too. Suppose that the water is heated up in an oven. Th ere, the air is hot too. Take the water container out of the oven just after having put it in: the water is still cold, even if it is cold in a lesser degree. Nonetheless, both the fi re and the hot air must have had an action, however brief, and this action cannot be but the actualization of some heat. What happened to this heat? 'I do not see any solution to this,' James confesses. What perplexes him is that instead of simply admitting that the action of heat is to destroy some degrees of the form of coldness (as the addition theory wants it), he is committed to show that it causes a whole new form of coldness, and he cannot explain how this is possible. Th is is a serious blow to the succession theory, which James leaves unanswered. In his wake, opponents and supporters of the theory will fi ercely discuss the case at hand. 31\n\n## 4 . H ervaeus N atalis and the CORRECTORIUM FRATRIS IACOBI METENSIS\n\nJames quickly was the target of reprehensions emanating from his own order. On the one hand, in his commentary on the Sentences Hervaeus Natalis criticizes James. On the other hand, a text known as the Correctorium fratris Iacobi Metensis , today preserved in a single manuscript, Le Mans Bibliothèque Municipale 231, discusses forty-three contentious theses of James. In both works, the succession theory is part of what James is blamed for.\n\nHervaeus likely commented on the Sentences in 1302-1303, 32 that\n\n- 31. Peter Auriol still uses the same example around 1317. See the passage of the Reportatio quoted by C. S chabel , 'Place, Space, and the Physics of Grace in Auriol's Sentences Commentary,' in: Vivarium 38/1 (2000), 117-161, pp. 119-120.\n- 32. According to W. D uba -  C.  S chabel ,  'Remigio,  Auriol,  Scotus,  and  the  myth of the two-year Sentences lecture at Paris,' p. 157 (see also C. S chabel , 'James of Metz's Lectura on the Sentences ,' p. 355). Earlier, it was generally believed that Hervaeus lectured in Paris from 1302 to 1304.\n\nis, shortly after James. In a recent book, Mikolaj Olszewski has identi fi ed  the  manuscripts  Bordeaux  Bibliothèque  Municipale  147  and Troyes  Bibliothèque  Municipale  ('Médiathèque  du  Grand  Troyes') 262 as witnesses of a fi rst version (a reportatio ? an ordinatio ?) of Hervaeus'  commentary, whereas the second version, a later redaction, is more common and well-known. 33 However, as far as the question on how intensi fi cation and remission occur is concerned (l. I, dist.17, &lt;q. 5&gt; 'Utrum caritas augeatur per additionem'), the fi rst version 34 does not di ff er much from the second version, 35 which I have consulted in the 1647 edition checked with the manuscripts Basel Universitätsbibliothek B IV 13 and Firenze Bibl. Naz., conv. sopp. B I 569. As I will show, in both versions Hervaeus discusses James's secunda lectura . 36\n\nAs  for  the Correctorium ,  it  was  probably  written  about  the  same period.  James  likely  disappeared  from  the  stage  shortly  after  having commented on the Sentences for the second time (in any case, we have no other trace of him whatsoever.) But Josef Koch has noted that the following passage of the Correctorium talks about James as if he were still  alive:  'Sed  iste  [James]  dicit  quod  non  videt  hanc  solutionem. Roget ergo Deum ut aperiat sibi oculos, ut possit videre; non video aliud  remedium.' 37 If  that  is  correct,  the Correctorium ,  which  refers also to James's secunda lectura (as  I'll  show  momentarily), must have been compiled not too long after 1301, that is to say, around the time Hervaeus was commenting on the Sentences in his turn.\n\nIn fact, Koch attributed the Correctorium to Hervaeus himself, on the grounds that there are numerous parallel passages in Hervaeus' Commentary . 38 Th is ascription has recently been challenged by Olszewski because the conception of theology as a discipline that the Correctorium attacks\n\n- 33. O lszewski , Dominican Theology at the Crossroads, p. 11.\n- 35. Except that in the Bordeaux manuscript, the question suddenly ends after the presentation of the third opinion, with the result that it includes neither Hervaeus' answer nor the replies to others' arguments.\n- 34. Troyes BM 262, f. 46vb - 48ra; Bordeaux BM 147, f. 47r-48r.\n- 36. This counterbalances O lszewski ' s remark ( Dominican Theology , p. 3) that Hervaeus used James's prima lectura to write the prologue to his Commentary . To be clear: I do not deny that Hervaeus knew the prima lectura ; I will just point out that he discusses an argument that is probably James's and is found only in the latter's secunda lectura .\n\n38.

T eil : Literargeschichtliche Grundlegung , Münster in W. 1927,  p. 271.\n\nis not only James's but also Hervaeus' 39 - unsurprisingly so, because, as Oslzewski has shown too, 40 Hervaeus extensively reproduced passages of the prologue of James's Commentary on the Sentences in his own Commentary . As for the latter point, however, I'll note that, as strange as it may be, it would not be the only time that a censor plagiarized (to use an anachronistic concept) the very victim of his censorship. Even though James of Lausanne was, as a baccalaureus sententiarius , a member of the Dominican  commission  presided  over  by  Hervaeus  that  investigated Durand of Saint-Pourçain's alleged errors in 1314, he felt free to copy extensively from Durand's Commentary when, in the same year or the following one, he wrote his own Commentary (hopefully on topics that were not among the articles censored; at least, that is the case for the issue of intension/remission.) 41 So the fact that Hervaeus took advantage of  James's  prologue  may  be  not  conclusive  regarding  Hervaeus'  noninvolvement in the Correctorium . Perhaps Olszewski's other argument, based on the conception of theology attacked by the Correctorium and shared by James and Hervaeus, is more decisive. However, as far as the two questions on the intensi fi cation/remission of forms are concerned, not only is the Correctorium perfectly in phase with Hervaeus' position, but q. 6 contains two passages that are word for word identical with Hervaeus' Commentary on the Sentences , book I, d. 17, q. 4, a.1. Th ese passages constitute the core of the responsio in the Correctorium , and they are respectively 38 and 47 lines long, out of the 137 lines of the whole question. Furthermore, q. 7 contains four shorter passages that are nearly identical with passages of q. 5 of Hervaeus' Commentary . Th is raises the  question  of  whether  the  author  of  the Correctorium copied  from Hervaeus, or Hervaeus from the author of the Correctorium , in case they are not one and the same person. 42 I shall leave at that the question of the authorship of the Correctorium , which still requires much research. Whatever the case may be, it is certain that the author, as Hervaeus in\n\n- 39. Dominican Theology at the Crossroads , p. 315.\n- 41. See J. C éleyrette -  J.-L. S olère ,  'Jacques de Lausanne, censeur et plagiaire de Durand de Saint-Pourçain: édition de la q. 2, d. 17 du l. I, de son Commentaire des Sentences ,' in: K. E mery - R.L. F riedman - A.

Another possible explanation would be that the Correctorium has  in  fact  several authors. Hervaeus would have taken care of the part on intensification/remission (among other topics), while the nature of theology would have been dealt with by someone else, who happened to be in disagreement with Hervaeus too.\n\nhis Commentary , was using James's secunda lectura , 43 at least for book I, since he mentions some dubia about James's d. 17, p. 2, q. 1 that are only in the T royes Additiones , and discusses the meaning of the passage of Aquinas's Summa Th eologiae quoted by James solely in the T royes Additiones .  V ery  likely,  the  author  of  the Correctorium worked on a text close to the one we know through the T royes manuscript under the form prima lectura plus Additiones .\n\n## 4 1 . . T he L atitude of F orms according to H ervaeus and the CORRECTORIUM\n\nEven though they criticize James, let us note that, in the matter of why certain qualitative forms can vary in intensity and whether this variation a ff ects their essence, both the Correctorium (f. 151 vb - 152 rb, &lt;q. 6&gt;) and Hervaeus' Commentary ( Sent . I, d. 17, q. 4) substantially modify Aquinas's position, inasmuch as they abandon the fi xity of the forms that are intensi fi able. 44 Th ese  forms  are  not  exactly  like  numbers, contrary to Aristotle's dictum ; they comprise a certain margin of indetermination, a range of possible degrees. 45 Aristotle only wanted\n\n- 43. As J. K och had noticed ('Jakob von Metz,' pp. 202-207).\n\n45. See A ristoteles , Metaphysica , VIII.3, 1043b33- 1044a9; cf. J ames of metz , Secunda lectura , T f. 15 vb l. 29-35, and H ervaeus N atalis , In quatuor libros Sententiarum commentaria, l. I d. 17 q. 4 a. 2, ad 3 m , Paris 1647, p. 95a C-D. Ibid ., pp. 93b D - 94a A: '(…) videtur mihi quod ratio quare aliqua forma suscipit magis et minus, est indeterminatio formae specificae, secundum quam est indeterminata ad hoc quod in sua essentia, vel saltem in suo esse ut alii dicunt, sit magis perfecta vel minus perfecta: quam indeterminationem alii latitudinem vel in essentia vel in esse nominant.' Cf. Subtilissima Heruei Natalis Britonis (…) quolibeta undecim (…) , Venise 1513, reprint Ridgewood (N.J.) 1966, Quodl. VI q. 11, f. 135 vb: 'in formis suscipientibus magis et minus, est quedam latitudo graduum, ita quod albedo intensa est quantum ad essentiam suam perfectior quam albedo remissa, non ita quod ista differentia graduum sit secundum absolutam rationem forme, quia differre secundum absolutam rationem forme est differre specie. Sed quia in natura forme est habilitas ad istam latitudinem graduum habendam in sua essentia, ex hoc quod non determinat sibi  gradum indivisibilem et precisum quo participetur a suo   subiecto, siue sit accidens separabile siue non, siue habeat esse in pluribus speciebus siue non.' I take this occasion to say that, although the authenticity of this 6 th Quodlibet (one of the Quodlibeta minora ) ascribed to Nédellec has been doubted, its q. 11 presents no doctrinal difference with Nédellec's other texts and is extremely close in the language, as can be seen in the previous passage and other quotes below. See also Amerini's article in this volume p. 173 fn. 19.\n\n- 44. Cf. T homas de A quino , Sum. Theol .  I II a ae ,  q.52 a.1 c.: '(…) species rerum sunt sicut numeri, in quibus additio vel diminutio variat speciem. Si igitur aliqua forma, vel quaecumque res, secundum seipsam vel secundum aliquid sui, sortiatur rationem speciei, necesse est quod, secundum se considerata, habeat determinatam rationem, quae neque in plus excedere, neque in minus deficere possit. Et huiusmodi sunt calor et albedo (…).'\n\nto say that their indetermination has limits, which cannot be exceeded without the intensi fi cation becoming a true alteration, that is, a change of species. In this, the Correctorium and Hervaeus' Commentary are in agreement with James. Th e doctrine that all forms are totally rigid (i.e., that there is no latitude in intensi fi able qualities) proved to be untenable for these Dominicans of the beginning of the 14 th century. 46\n\nNevertheless,  the Correctorium and  Hervaeus' Commentary try  to interpret Aquinas in a way that aligns him with this view. Th omas's thought is misinterpreted, they claim, if one makes him say (as Giles of Rome does) that absolute accidental forms such as qualities do not have in themselves a latitude of degrees. 47 A more intense whiteness is not just the same form received more perfectly. It is in itself (as opposed to: qua received) a more perfect whiteness than a less intense whiteness. Admittedly, the participation of the form by the subject can be greater or lesser, but the condition for this is that there must be a greater or lesser perfection in the essence of the accidental quality itself ('maioritas  vel  minoritas  quantum  ad  perfectionem  forme'). 48 Th us,  a  more intense whiteness has a greater perfection in essence than a less intense one. Both the Correctorium and Hervaeus' Commentary invoke the ad tertium of Aquinas's Summa theologiae II II a ae , q. 24, a. 4, where Th omas writes that for an accidental form, to be more rooted in its subject is to  be  augmented in essence. Th is  expression  must  be  taken  literally, which implies that something has changed in the essence itself. And when Aquinas writes (I II a ae , q. 52 a. 1) that that from which things have their species must be indivisible, one must understand that he is not speaking of some indivisibility in degrees within a form, but only of the formal di ff erences that divide a genus. Th is is why Th omas does not say that that from which things have their species is strictly indivisible, but that it is ' quasi indivisible,' the Correctorium and Hervaeus' Commentary contend.\n\nHowever, our authors do not lapse into the Franciscan conception of the composition of forms. Th e linchpin of their thesis consists in admitting,  not  distinct  degrees  in  this  latitude,  as  in  the  Franciscan\n\n46. Cf. already I ohannes P arisiensis (Q uidort ), Commentaire sur les Sentences ,  ed. J.-P . M üller , Rome 1961, vol. 1, p. 207 l. 136-137: 'Dicendum ergo quod forma accidentalis habet latitudinem infra quam sunt diversi gradus secundum quos potest augeri et minui' (see also p. 201 l. 61, p. 202 l. 82).\n\n- 48.

Th eol . II II a ae , q. 24, a. 5), his thinking may have been poorly explained by some (probably Giles again), the Correctorium and Hervaeus' Commentary claim. 50 James is right, they both concede, when he points out that the terminus ad quem of a process, which is the form acquired by that change, is not di ff erent from the change itself. Change, in fact, is the very same form on the way towards actualization; complete actualization is the end of the process. James is also right to say that it is impossible that something obtains its intrinsic essence by reference to something extrinsic, especially in the case of forms that belong to an absolute category of being (in contrast to the category of relation), such as qualities are. However, a speci fi c nature may include something extrinsic in obliquo , for instance a fi nal cause (at least the proximate fi nal cause) or an e ffi cient cause. Th is is how, for instance, a habit is speci fi ed by that towards which it is directed. Although they have by themselves their own nature, this nature includes a reference to their object. It is in  that  sense,  the Correctorium and  Hervaeus' Commentary contend,\n\n49. Correctorium q. 7, ms. Le Mans 231, f. 152 va: 'Modo dico quod forma intensa non est diversa a remissa sicut totum a toto, sicut albedo a nigredine, sed magis sicut totum a parte, ita quod forma remissa se habet sicut pars et sicut id quod exceditur, sed intensa se habet sicut totum, non quidem secundum partes signabiles sed secundum partes virtuales.' Nédellec, I Sent. d. 17 q. 5, p. 98a, A-C: 'Quarta opinio quae videtur mihi ad praesens magis probabilis, est quod illud augmentum non fiat per additionem gradus ad gradum, ita quod sint ibi duo gradus distincti, quorum unus addatur alteri, et unus possit distincte signari ab altero: sed fit tale augmentum per hoc quod forma eadem quae prius erat imperfecta fit perfectior, ita quod ipsa facta intensa, habet plus quam prius, non secundum diversas partes signabiles, sed virtuales: ita quod primus gradus continetur in secunda virtute: sicut si aliqua aqua bicubita rarefiat et fiat tricubita, quantitas aquae rarefactae continet plus quam prius (...) non quidem secundum partem signabilem quae posset divisim signari ab aliis duobus cubitis praecedentibus, sed secundum partes virtuales.' Nédellec perhaps shows here some hesitation, as he submits, he says, 'the opinion which presently seems to me more probable.' However, as we will see in his Quodlibet II , this solution will become definitive. For the sake of room, I cannot explore more this notion of virtual parts here, but I intend to show elsewhere that Nédellec probably took this idea from I ohannes P ari -siensis (Q uidort ), I Sent. (ed. M üller , vol. 1, q.71 [= d.17 q.3], pp. 208-209) or Peter of Auvergne's Quodlibet III . On the example of rarefactions, cf. Peter Auriol as explained by C. S chabel , 'Place, space, and the physics of grace,' p. 123.\n\n50. Correctorium , q. 6, f. 151 vb - 152 ra; H ervaeus N atalis , I Sent . d. 17 q. 4, p. 93ab. The two passages are nearly identical.\n\nthat the whole of Aquinas's remark must be understood. Let us note, however, that the point is moot: Th omas introduced this remark to accommodate the exceptional case of motion and like realities that do intensify  or  increase  in  essence,  but  the Correctorium and  Hervaeus' Commentary admit as much for all intensi fi able natures.\n\n## 4 2 . . R efutation of J ames of M etz\n\nOn the other hand, the question of how intensi fi cation occurs is the real bone of contention between James and his fellow Dominicans. Both the Correctorium (f. 152 rb - 152 vb &lt;q. 7&gt;) and Hervaeus' Commentary (I, d. 17, q. 5) strenuously oppose the succession theory. However, the Correctorium focuses on James, as one would expect, whereas Hervaeus' Commentary takes  a  wider  view:  'Ista  positio,  licet  sit  magnorum  et subtilis …,' 51 Hervaeus writes, by which he surely alludes not to James, but more likely to the venerable Godfrey, and to Th omas of Bailly, who resolutely defended Godfrey's thesis. 52 Nevertheless, after presenting in support of the succession theory two arguments that can be traced back\n\n## 51. P . 97a, D.\n\n52. See the note in the margin: 'Contra opinionem Thomae' (p. 97a C), which refers, not to Thomas Aquinas, who does not hold this position, as we saw, but to Thomas of Bailly, who does sustain it in q. 15 of his Quodlibet III (see below p. 315). See also Bailly's Quodl. III q. 16 and Quodl. IV q. 11. Licensed in theology around 1300, Bailly disputed as master actu regens six quodlibetal questions between 1301 and 1307. He became chancellor of the University in 1316. Dumont suggests that he jumped into the defense of Godfrey's theory after Scotus's extensive attack against the latter ('Godfrey of Fontaines and the succession theory,' p. 102). Additionally, let us note that Godfrey was back to teaching in Paris around 1303-1304. R. L ambertini , 'Political Quodlibeta ,' in: C. S chabel (ed.), Theological Quodlibeta , t. I, p.459, has shown that the date of his Quodlibet III must be moved earlier than the year 1305 suggested by Glorieux (P . G lorieux , Répertoire des Maîtres en Théologie , Paris 1933, notice 214; La Littérature quodlibétique II , Paris 1935, pp. 273-277). Given that it is certain that Bailly's Quodlibet IV was held at Lent 1304 (since Bailly mentions the bull Inter cunctas , dated Feb. 17, 1304, and speaks of Benedict XI as being alive, whereas the latter died on July 7, 1304), his Quodlibet III must have been disputed in 1303 (Lent or Advent), which makes quite likely a dialogue with Nédellec, who was commenting or had just commented the Sentences at that time. This is confirmed, I think, by the fact that Bailly discusses and rejects at length the case of nutrition as a suitable comparison for intensification processes ( Quodl. III, q. 15, ed. P . G lorieux , Quodlibets, texte critique avec introduction, notes et tables , Paris 1960, pp. 211 and 216-217), which precisely is used by Nédellec and the Correctorium (see  below pp. 317-318). The fourth opinion that Bailly attacks in q. 11 of his Quodl. IV (ed. G lorieux , pp. 284-285) is also probably Nédellec's (cf. CR2 NR2 / and CR3 NR3 / below, p. 318).\n\nto Godfrey (see arguments G3 and G2 , above), 53 Hervaeus adds a third one, which I have found only in James: J4 (see NO2 hereafter). Unless this argument has in fact another origin, this seems to imply that James was important enough for Hervaeus to take him into account in his Sentences commentary. Moreover, discussions about this argument recur in the debate between Hervaeus and Durand of Saint-Pourçain that we will review next. As for the Correctorium , it reports, naturally enough, only the arguments found in James, namely, the three arguments that were already in the prima lectura ( J1 , J2 , J3 ), plus the additional argument introduced by the secunda lectura ( J4 ). Interestingly, the Correctorium presents them in the following order: J1 , J4 , J2 , J3 . Th is is perhaps the sign that the author had a version of James's secunda lectura in  which J4 ,  known  to  us  from  the Additiones in  the T royes manuscript, was included in the main text as the second argument (as it should if one follows the instructions given by the Additiones , T f. 16 rb l. 10-13). If so, this version of the secunda lectura was di ff erent from what we have, since J4 is found in no other manuscript than T royes, as I said earlier. Further, perhaps as another indication of a di ff erent version of James's secunda lectura , it is noteworthy that in J4 as reported by both the Correctorium and Hervaeus' Commentary the example offered is the opposite of the example proposed in the T royes Additiones : instead of an intensi fi cation of heat, the talk is of a diminution of heat. Let us fi rst  examine the objections presented by the Correctorium and Hervaeus' Commentary against the succession theory.\n\nTh e Correctorium notes with irony that James himself raised enough objections against his own position. 54 Hence, the author decides that he does not have to add more objections (contrary to what Hervaeus does in his Commentary ), but only to refute James's arguments in favor of the succession theory. However, after rejecting these arguments (as we'll see momentarily), the Correctorium lingers on the third doubt that James formulated against his own solution. 55 If in each instant of an intensi fi cation the previous form is destroyed and a new form generated, this change is in reality a discontinuous series of mutations, or, rather,\n\n- 53. Also argument 2 in Bailly's Quodlibet III q. 15, p. 209.\n- 55. Correctorium f. 152 vb.\n- 54. Ms. Le Mans 231, q. 7, f. 152 va. See above p. 310.\n\nof mutata esse , or again, if you will, a series of leaps from degree to degree, whereas an essential characteristic of change, in the framework of Aristotelian natural philosophy, is its continuity. 56\n\nA fi rst answer to this di ffi culty, which James reports, was given by Godfrey himself. 57 During  a  local  motion,  the  mobile  is  at  no  time totally in actuality in a place (this would be rest); it is only in a place in  actuality  mixed  with  potentiality,  passing  through  this  place  and tending to another one. Th is, according to Godfrey, makes its motion continuous. Likewise, in an intensi fi cation/remission the mobile never is in complete actuality under any of the intermediary forms. As each of these forms only has an imperfect being ( esse imperfectum ), their distinction and succession does not prevent the change from being continuous. However, James is not convinced by this response. At every moment of the process, he thinks, the subject of change must be under a form in full actuality: it has a certain degree of heat or a degree of whiteness, for instance.\n\nInstead, James proposes giving up on the requirement of continuity for changes in the category of quality, as opposed to other changes. 58 Local motion is continuous because of the continuous quantity ( magnitudo ) in which it takes place. In a qualitative change, there may be continuity too with respect to the subject, due to its extension, that is to say, in case its parts are a ff ected one after the other, without interruption. But as far as intensi fi cation as such is concerned (i.e. the intensi fi cation  of  a  quality  in  one  and  the  same  part),  continuity  is not necessary. Th e  model  to  follow  is  not  that  of  local  motion,  but that of illumination. Th e whole volume of air is instantaneously illuminated (or so the Aristotelians believed) as soon as the source of light is actualized, at least if all the parts of air are equally disposed to receive this illumination. Likewise, in an alteration, when a subject is in the ultimate state of preparation, it receives a quality instantaneously. But,\n\n56.  T f. 45 rb l. 48 - 45 va l. 2: 'Aliud dubium est quod mutatio ad formam accidentalem que est alteratio non erit continua set componeretur ex tot mutatis esse quot sunt gradus in essencia forme, puta albedinis uel caritatis.' T f. 16 va l. 45-49 (Addition, secunda lectura ): 'Tertium dubium est quod secundum hanc positionem alteracio non esset motus continuus sed agregatio mutatorum esse, quoniam videmus &lt;quod&gt; mutatio est corruptio unius et generatio alterius. Set per te in alteratione non est nisi corruptio gradus imperfecti forme et generatio gradus perfecti. Ergo non sunt ibi nisi mutata esse, quod est contra philosophum 6° physicorum.'\n\n57. T f. 45 va l. 2-12. Cf. G odefridus de F ontibus , Quodl. IX q. 11, p. 249. 58. T f. 45 va l. 12-23.\n\nin an intensi fi cation/remission, each degree is the ultimate preparation for the next degree. Th erefore, passing from one to the other is instantaneous, that is, is a mutation rather than a continuous change.\n\nTh e Correctorium staunchly rejects this idea:\n\nCO1 : Continuity is essential to any kind of change ('est passio motus in communi'). When Aristotle says that something can be instantaneously altered (like the air illuminated), he is not speaking of an alteration as a process, but of the result of this process, the resulting state ( alteratum esse ), which obtains immediately. When there really is a process, this change cannot be but continuous, and if there is an interruption at some point, what happens next is another process, not the continuation of the same process. It is therefore impossible that an intensi fi cation or a remission be a series of leaps or instantaneous changes. 59\n\nOn  the  other  hand,  Hervaeus' Commentary , probably  due  to  the eference  to r the 'magni,'  discusses  the  succession  theory  rather reverenter . Hervaeus does not declare it absurd, or even false, but only warns that it is open to serious objections. He presents three of them.\n\nNO1 :  A  change made of successive, numerically di ff erent forms, would require an in fi nite number of such forms. Th e reason behind this is that in the span of time in which this change takes place, there is an in fi nity of instants. Accordingly, there must be an in fi nity of degrees of the quality, because if the change is not interrupted, there are no two instants in which the quality has the same degree, the intensity of that quality changing constantly. Moreover, given that changes are distinguished by the forms that are acquired, one would in reality have an in fi nite number of changes ( mutationes ) in what is apparently one change, and there would accordingly be an in fi nity of states ( mutata esse ) of the subject of change. 60\n\n## 59. Correctorium q. 7, f. 152 vb.\n\n60. I Sent .  d. 17 q. 4, pp. 97a D - 97b A: '(...) quot sunt quae differunt secundum intensum et remissum, tot sunt formae differentes numero ab inuicem. Sed in qualibet alteratione successiua sunt infinita talia. Ergo in qualibet alteratione sunt infinitae formae differentes numero. (...) Minor probatur, quia quot sunt nunc in toto tempore alterationis, tot sunt differentes gradus secundum intensum et remissum, quia in toto tempore alterationis non est dare duo nunc in quibus forma secundum quam alteratio sit, sit in eodem gradu. Sed in quolibet tempore sunt infinita nunc. (…) Hoc autem est inconueniens, quia motus et mutationes plurificantur secundum formas quae acquiruntur per motum; et sic in qualibet alteratione essent infinitae mutationes in actu et infinita mutata esse.'\n\nAlthough this objection may be related to CO1 and James's third doubt because of the expression 'mutata esse,' Hervaeus does not place the emphasis on the discontinuity that would ensue, but on the in fi nity of steps that an intensi fi cation would have to go through-which, implicitly, makes it impossible, since going through an in fi nity is not a task that can be ever completed. Th e thrust of the objection is made explicit by Th omas of Bailly, who addresses it in his Quodlibet III, q. 15. 61 Hervaeus does report that the defenders of the succession theory answer that this in fi nity is in fi eri and in potentiality. 62 But their response is not tenable, he claims. If the forms are numerically distinct, they cannot be in continuity with each other; therefore, there is an actual in fi nity of such forms, and consequently an actual in fi nity of mutata esse .\n\nInterestingly, Hervaeus' second objection turns James's fourth argument ( J4 ) on its head:\n\nNO2 : When something cold diminishes heat, it does not actualize coldness  in  the  patient,  because  coldness  cannot  coexist  with  heat.  It  does not actualize a lesser heat either, because coldness cannot produce heat. 63 Th erefore, the agent does nothing. However, this cannot be taken in an absolute sense, because its action is real. Rather, it must be understood literally, so to speak, in the sense that the cold does not produce anything but simply takes away some of the heat (which is the 'privative' action that James does not admit.) Now, this entails that the same form of heat is diminished, rather than another form of a lesser degree produced. 64\n\n61. 'First difficulty,' ed. G lorieux , p. 212. Pace D umont ('Godfrey of Fontaines and the succession theory,' pp. 101-102), I do not think that the two objections, on discontinuity and infinity, raised by Scotus in his Parisian lecture are exactly the same as the one at hand. Moreover, the Oxford Lectura does raise the discontinuity objection, in terms that, in the end, are closer: 'si per recessum a quocumque gradu generetur aliud suppositum, igitur supposita sibi invicem continue succedunt secundum successionem motus. Quaero igitur an quodlibet illorum suppositorum persistit in indivisibili, aut divisibiliter et in divisibili temporis. Si in indivisibili, tantum manens per instans, igitur motus componeretur ex mutatis esse (...)' ( Lectura , l. I d. 17 p. 2, q.1, Opera Omnia t. XVII, Vatican 1966, n° 143, p. 226).\n\n- 63. On these two counts, then, Hervaeus thinks that James is right.\n\n62. I Sent. , d. 17, q. 4, 97b A. The potential infinite reply is in T homas de B ailly ( Quodl. III q. 15, pp. 213-214), but for the in fieri reply one probably has to go back to Godfrey himself ( Quodl. IX, q. 11, p. 249).\n\n- 64. I Sent . d. 17 q. 4, p. 97b B.\n\n## Finally, Hervaeus lodges a third objection:\n\nNO3 :  When a greater  quantity succeeds a  smaller  quantity  because  one subject succeeds another, one does not say that this is an augmentation of the smaller quantity. For instance, when fi re, which expands more, is engendered from air or water, which take less room, this is not a process of augmentation. It is a process of generation, and correlatively a new, greater form of quantity has replaced the lesser form of quantity. On the contrary, in a process of augmentation of the same thing, numerically the same accidental form of quantity is augmented. Likewise, if an intensi fi cation is really an increase, then it must be the same form that, initially imperfect, becomes perfect. If, on the contrary, a more perfect form replaced a less perfect form (as the succession theory wants it), one could not say that there is an increase. 65\n\nAfter this array of objections to the succession theory, we still have to survey the rebuttal of the arguments that support the theory.\n\nAs expected, the Correctorium refutes each of James's four arguments. Th ese refutations all have parallel passages in Hervaeus' Commentary . Although the latter does not report, and therefore does not discuss, G1 J1 / ,  the Correctorium gainsays J1 in  the  same  way  as  one  of  the Commentary ' s  rebuttals of the addition theory. Th e ad tertium of  the Commentary ' s q. 5 66 is supposed to respond to the third argument quod sic at the very beginning of the question, and this argument supports the addition theory (the incipit of the question being: 'Utrum caritas augeatur per additionem.') However, there is in fact a common point between the addition theory and the succession theory: both argue that if a change is real, it must bring something new, which was not already present (a 'part' or degree of the form according to the addition theory; a new form of a di ff erent degree for the succession theory). 67 Th is is why the Correctorium can use against J1 the same response as the one given by the Commentary ' s ad tertium :\n\n65. Ibid ., p. 97b B-D.\n\n67. Cf. G2 above and the third argument quod sic in Hervaeus' question: 'Praeterea aut aliquid acquiritur de novo in eo quod movetur motu intensionis, aut nihil; si nihil, ergo motus realis est ad nihil; si aliquid, ergo illud est additum de novo ei quod praeexistebat' (p. 96b B).\n\n66. Ibid, pp. 98a D - 98b A.\n\nCR1 : Th e fact that every action brings about something that is new and di ff erent from the starting point can be understood in two ways. Either the terminus ad quem di ff ers entirely from the terminus a quo ; or it di ff ers from it in part only. But a more intense quality di ff ers from a less intense that preceded it not in totality (like white di ff ers from black, for instance), but in such a way that the less intense becomes included in something greater, like a part in a whole. Th e new quality is not something altogether di ff erent; it is the same as the less intense one, but completed, more perfect. 68\n\nOf course, the talk is here about 'virtual parts,' as we saw earlier, and not distinguishable ( signabiles ) parts within the intensi fi ed form as if one could really di ff erentiate  ( signari  actu  distincter )  what  the  initial degree was and what has been brought about by the intensi fi cation.\n\nAnother response in q. 5 of Hervaeus' Commentary ,  the ad quintum , 69 which directly answers G2 (and therefore J2 ,  as  we'll  see momentarily), can also indirectly rebut J1 . Th e Correctorium does use it to provide an alternative refutation of J1 ('Vel potest dici…'):\n\nCR1' : True, something must be acquired during an intensi fi cation, but this something can be aggregated to what was before, not as a part actually distinct, but as a part distinct by disposition ( habitu ). 70\n\nAs  an  illustration  of  this  kind  of  distinction,  the Correctorium ,  like Hervaeus' Sentences commentary, 71 points  to  the  paradigm  of  nutrition. Food is aggregated to the matter of the body; however, the food remains somehow distinct, not in actuality, but by disposition, because it  could  exist  just  by  itself  if  it  were  taken  away. 72 Likewise,  what is brought about by the intensi fi cation becomes one with the quality that preexisted, and nevertheless is di ff erent from it.

Th e initial degree is contained virtually in the higher degree. If the initial degree did not somehow subsist, the agent would not be intensifying a given quality properly speaking, but producing instead a quality that is altogether di ff erent.\n\nTo James's second argument ( J2 ), Hervaeus' Commentary ( ad quintum ,  more  likely  against G2 ,  but  applicable  to J2 ),  and,  in  a  much shorter way, the Correctorium ( ad tertiam rationem ), 73 respond that:\n\nCR2 NR2 / : Th e accidental form which is that according to which change occurs only has to be, in the terminus ad quem , di ff erent from what it was in the terminus a quo in the same manner as a completed form di ff ers from an incomplete form, as we saw above in the responses to J1 . It need not be a di ff erent form. 74\n\nTo James's third argument (J3), the Correctorium ( ad quartam rationem ) 75 and  Hervaeus' Commentary ( ad  quartum ,  more  likely  against G3 , but applicable to J3) answer that:\n\nCR3 NR3 / : Th e terminus a  quo and  the terminus  ad  quem are  not incompatible with each other in regard to the positive essence of the quality, which they share. Th ey are opposed to each other only with regard to the privation of perfection (in the case of an intensi fi cation), which is present at the beginning and then eliminated by the change (and conversely for a remission). 76\n\nFinally, to James's fourth argument ( J4 ), both the Correctorium ( ad secundam rationem ) and Hervaeus' Commentary ( ad sextum ) answer the following:\n\nCR4 NR4 / : An agent that cools down a hot thing acts inasmuch as it obstructs the power that conserves heat, preventing this power from maintaining  the  heat  in  the  same  state. Th e  same  goes  for  local  motion:  an\n\n73. Recall that the Correctorium inserts J4 between J1 and J2 (see above, p. 310), which means that the latter becomes third.\n\n75.

Th e fi ght was not over though, as another supporter of the succession theory, or at least a variant of it, was looming within the Dominican order: Durand of Saint-Pourçain.\n\n## 5 .

As Walter Burley will later point out, 'many' endorse this solution. 80 Among those was, as we saw earlier, Th omas of Bailly, a prominent actor on the Parisian stage, 81 and Hervaeus deals with some of his arguments in the fi rst part of the question.

He is seconded by P .T.

For other reactions to Bailly's defense of the succession theory in his Quodlibet III , see D umont , 'Godfrey of Fontaines and the succession theory,' pp. 102-105.\n\ndence I present below, however, I submit that the succession theory had also found a defender in the person of Durand of Saint-Pourçain. I also submit that Durand, who was baccalareus sententiarus at the time, was involved in the debate when this quodlibetal question was disputed.\n\nTh e general outline of the question is somewhat peculiar. It comprises two main parts:\n\n- A) Discussion of the validity of the following inference: 'If an intensi fi ed form is numerically di ff erent from the remitted form, there is an in fi nity of successive forms in an intensi fi cation.' 82\n- B) Discussion of the premiss of the inference, i.e., whether an intensi fi ed form is numerically di ff erent from the remitted form. 83\n\nSo, before coming to the core of the issue, namely, whether the succession theory is true, the whole fi rst part is about the legitimacy of a deduction which, as we saw, amounts to an objection to the succession theory (see NO1 , above), since going through an in fi nity of forms was thought to be an impossibility. Th is shows that the question put to Hervaeus is highly contextualized, and that the reader, so to speak, jumps in the middle of an ongoing discussion about the fairness of that objection, which had been raised by Hervaeus in his commentary on the Sentences and addressed by Th omas of Bailly in his Quodlibet III in 1303. Hervaeus intends here to demonstrate that the succession theory proponents do have to concede that an intensi fi cation comprises an in fi nity of successive forms (which makes the theory untenable), and he refutes two responses given by Th omas of Bailly: (1) even though all the forms of di ff erent degrees are numerically di ff erent within a given change, these forms nevertheless are one by continuity;  (2) their in fi nity is only in fi nite in potentiality. 84 For the sake of brevity, I will leave aside this discussion.\n\nTh e second part of the question begins with (1) a refutation of the premise of the inference, that is, the very thesis of the succession theory, thanks to a number of objections and the refutation of counterobjections. Th en, (2) Hervaeus explains how it is possible that a form remains numerically the same throughout the process while acquiring what it did not fi rst possess. I will leave these points aside too. Finally,\n\n82. Ff. 58 vb - 59 va.\n\n84. See T homas de B ailly , Quodlibet III q. 15, ed. G lorieux , p. 214.\n\n83. Ff. 59 va - 61 rb.\n\n(3) the discussion fl ares up again with the presentation of twelve objections to Hervaeus' thesis (which are so many arguments in favor of the succession theory), followed by their systematic refutation. 85 Th e addition of these twelve objections at the end makes the structure of the second part peculiar too and gives the impression of a live debate, in which a participant launches a new attack on the respondens with a new set of objections.\n\nTh ere are reasons to think that this objector was Durand. Bernard Lombardi, a Dominican who wrote a Sentences commentary in the late 1320s, 86 reports  very  extensively  Durand's  discussion  of  the  intensifi cation of forms. Durand's solution on the 'how' of intensi fi cation/ remission, as Lombardi presents it, is a variant of the succession theory, and  the  arguments  in  favor  of  this  theory  attributed  to  Durand  by Lombardi correspond to eight of the twelve fi nal objections in Hervaeus' question. Th ere is no room for uncertainty about their ascription to Durand: instead of the usual 'quidam dicunt' with at best an abbreviated name in the margin, the main text in one of the manuscripts reads in full letters: 'Alia opinio est Durandi qui ponit quod forma non subscipit magis et minus sic quod gradus remissus remaneat   adueniente intenso, ymo corrumpitur.' 87 Moreover, after rebutting Durand, Lombardi  provides  a  solution  which  is  (without  him  saying  it)  mostly  a long summary, sometimes a paraphrase, sometimes even word for word excerpts, of q. 13 of Hervaeus' Quodlibet II 88 - not only of the core of his solution, but also of the objections and responses that his question\n\n85.

Distinction 17 of book I of his Sentences commentary is found in three manuscripts: Naples Naz. VII G 98 on the one hand, Leipzig Univ. 542 and Erfurt CA 2° 368 on the other hand. The differences between them point to two different lecturae , or perhaps at least one reportatio . See also C. S chabel - R.L. F riedman - I. B alcoyiannopoulou , 'Peter of Palude and the Parisian Reaction to Durand of St Pourçain on Future Contingents,' in: Archivum Fratrum Praedicatorum 71 (2001), 182-300, pp. 218 and 247-248. Contrary to the case of book I dist. 38 that they examine, Bernardi's report of Durand's opinion cannot have been derived from Peter of Palude, as the latter's q. 2 of dist. 17 is very different.\n\n88. Leipzig f. 37rb-38ra, Erfurt f. 91vb-92vb.\n\ncontains. Th is may indicate that Lombardi was well aware of the debate between Hervaeus and Durand, and probably presented their two positions as they were, historically, pitted against each other.\n\nIn itself, the ascription of the succession theory to Durand should not come as a surprise. It might only con fi rm the intellectual a ffi liation between James of Metz and Durand that has been highlighted by Koch. 89 Since James probably lectured on the Sentences in  Paris  in  1300-01, Durand, who started around that time the three-year   lectorate program (see below), may well have attended his lectures and paid heed to his criticism of the Th omist conception of intensi fi cation and his move in favor of Godfrey's solution. However, let us note that a long passage of Durand's early version of his commentary on the Sentences that was not included in the fi nal version shows that Durand knew fi rst hand Godfrey's Quaestio ordinaria 18, which he analyzes and criticizes at length as far as the indivisibility of forms is concerned (Durand,   instead, admits the existence of degrees in forms). 90 Besides, we saw there were at the time other supporters of the succession theory. Th us, even if James did not hand down to Durand this theory, the latter had other possible sources of information.\n\nWhat may seem to pose a problem, however, is that Durand's succession theory as presented by Bernard Lombardi is not straightforwardly identical  to  Durand's  solution  in  the  last  and  'o ffi cial'  redaction  of his Commentary on the Sentences . 91 Furthermore, no theory at all can be found in the extant manuscripts of the earlier version(s) of book I either, as they do not tackle at all the question of how intensi fi cation takes place ('quomodo augeatur'). Th ey contain a single question on intensi fi cation: 'Utrum caritas augeri,' which only discusses in which forms intensi fi cation can take place. So, isn't Lombardi mistaken when he presents Durand as a proponent of the succession theory?\n\nIn  fact,  this  discrepancy  can  be  explained.  But fi rst,  let  me  summarize  the status quaestionis concerning  the  stages  of  the  writing  of Durand's Sentences commentary.\n\n- 89. J.

R etucci , Scriptum super IV Libros Sententiarum. Distinctiones 4-17 primi libri , Leuven 2017, pp. 236-245. How this acknowledgement of degrees in the essence of qualities is compatible with some variant of the succession theory will become clearer below. On the other hand, the explanation of why only qualities can be intensified or remitted ( ibid . pp. 246-249) is borrowed from Godfrey. Additionally, this early version contains (pp. 227-236) a presentation and refutation of Giles of Rome's theory, which was also left out in the final version.\n\nAccording to the reconstruction of Durand's early career provided by William Courtenay, 92 Durand received at the Dominicam studium generale in Paris, probably from 1300 to 1303, the three years training required for being a conventual theology lector , and then returned to the vicariate he was coming from, that of Burgundy, probably in the convent of Lyon. He was sent back to Paris to follow the curriculum leading to the theology doctorate. He was there in 1307 for a preparatory year, 93 and lectured on the Sentences as baccalaureus sententiarum in the academic year 1308-1309. 94 Whether he had already commented on the Sentences in a provincial convent 95 (if so, probably in Lyon), or simply had prepared his lecture notes in 1307-1308, 96 there was a fi rst version of his commentary, named redaction A by Koch, when Durand began lecturing in Paris. However, Durand's teaching came immediately under attack by Hervaeus Natalis, who was since 1307 the Dominican regent master. As Koch has shown, Hervaeus, in several questions of his Quodlibet II, held during Advent 1308 or Lent 1309, criticizes ideas contained in Durand's book I. 97 Moreover, in 1309 (Sept. 17)\n\n92. W.J. C ourtenay , 'Durand in his educational and intellectual context,' in A. S peer -F. R etucci , T . J eschke - G. G uldentops (eds.), Durand of Saint-Pourçain and his Sentences commentary. Historical, Philosophical and Theological Issues, Leuven 2014, pp. 13-34.\n\n94. 1308-1309 only, if one accepts Duba's and Schabel's conclusion that the lectures on all the books of the Sentences spanned a single academic year (see above, fn. 23, and in particular W . D uba - C. S chabel , 'Remigio, Auriol, Scotus, and the myth of the two-year Sentences lecture at Paris,' p. 157; see also C. S chabel , 'James of Metz's Lectura on the Sentences ,' p. 355). Courtenay's chapter, which predates Duba's and Schabel's paper, proposes 1308-09 and 1309-10.\n\n93. His name appears in a document related to the Templars affair, dated October 26 of that year, but after the names of those presented as doctors and bachelors in theology, which means he was not yet baccalaureus .\n\n95. As it is believed by R.L. F riedman , 'The Sentences Commentary, 1250-1320,' in: G.R. E vans (ed.), Mediaeval Commentaries on the Sentences of Peter Lombard , Leiden 2002, p. 71.\n\n97. See J. K och , Durandus , pp. 60-72, 214-215 and B. D ecker , Die Gotteslehre des Jakob von Metz. Untersuchungen zur Dominikanertheologie zu Beginn des 14. Jahrhunderts , Münster in W. 1967, pp. 85-88, who showed that Hervaeus' qq. 3, 7 and 8 respectively attack d. 36 q.\n\n96. See C ourtenay , 'Durand in his educational and intellectual context,' pp. 28-30. The second hypothesis, Courtenay notes, fits better with Durand's famous remark, in the conclusion of his 'official' version, that his early version had been circulated prematurely and without his consent: 'Scripta super quatuor Sententiarum libros iuvenis inchoavi, sed senex complevi; siquidem quod in primis dictaveram et scripseram fuit a quibusdam curiosis mihi subreptum, antequam fuisset per me sufficienter correctum (…)' ( In Petri Lombardi Sententias Theologicas Commentarium libri IIII [= Sent . C], 2 vols., V enice 1579; repr. Ridgewood, NJ 1964, f. 423rb). It would be hard to make sense of this, Courtenay thinks, if Durand had already lectured in a provincial convent, that is, publicized his views. On the other hand, let us keep in mind that Durand left in the final redaction a hint about the fact he gave several lecturae , since he speaks of his ' first lecture': 'Unde quod dixi alias in fine secundi libri sententiarum primae lecturae…' ( II Sent . C, d. 44, q. 5, n. 10, f. 208 ra).\n\nHervaeus was elected provincial of France (he will become general master of the order in 1318), and the same year the General Chapter of the order at Saragossa required Dominicans not to hold positions opposed to what was generally taken to be Aquinas's doctrine. 98 Under this pressure, and probably in view of securing his chances to be promoted to the   doctorate, Durand soon started to modify his commentary. Th is revision process, carried out before 1312, resulted in redaction B, in which Durand mitigated his criticism of and departure from Th omas Aquinas. 99 Later, when he entered an episcopal career (from 1317 on), and was thereby free from the jurisdiction of the Dominican order, Durand wrote a third and fi nal version of his commentary (redaction C), in which he returned to many of his original views, modi fi ed at times on the basis of criticisms he had received. 100\n\nLet us now go back to Bernard Lombardi. As I said, the succession theory he ascribes to Durand is not that of redaction C and is nowhere to be found (as, for that matter, any theory whatsoever on the 'how' of the intensi fi cation/remission) in the manuscripts we have of Durand's early  versions  of  his  commentary.  However,  as  far  as  book  I  is  concerned, all those manuscripts transmit the same redaction. Th is means that one of the two pre-1317 versions, either redaction A or redaction B, has disappeared. It is quite possible, then, that Lombardi discloses an otherwise unknown stage of Durand's thought.\n\nIn  which  version  might  he  have  presented  this  theory?  Koch  believed that the extant non-C manuscripts of book I contain redaction\n\n3, d. 33 q. 1, and d. 27 q. 2 of Durand's book I. For q. 7 and his attack on Durand's conception of relation in divinis , see I. I ribarren , Durandus , pp. 149-155.\n\n99. As a result, he received the doctorate and was appointed magister actu regens in 1312, probably thanks to the intervention of pope Clement V. Nonetheless, Durand was subjected to an investigation of the Dominican order, entrusted to a commission presided by Hervaeus, in 1313-1314 (decision of the General Chapter of Metz in 1313), and again in 1316-1317 (decision of the General Chapter of Montpellier in 1316). See K och , Durandus , pp. 68-72, 200-207, 410-417, and id ., 'Philosophische und theologische Irrtumslisten von 1270-1329: Ein Beitrag zur Entwicklung der theologischen Zensuren', in Kleine Schriften , Rome 1973, t.

B.M. R eichert , Monumenta Ordinis Fratrum Praedicatorum Historica 3 and 4, Rome 1889-1899, t. II, p. 38). See I ribar -ren , Durandus , p. 182, fn. 3, for whom the Saragossa regulation specifically targets Durand.\n\n100. Probably between 1318 and 1328. Cf. K och , Durandus , p. 16 sqq.\n\nA. Moreover, he believed that Durand did not issue a second redaction of book I. However, in their recent edition of the early version of distinctions 4-17 of book I, Massimo Perrone and Fiorella Retucci have reached the opposite conclusion: all the extant non-C manuscripts of book I contain redaction B (in two di ff erent stages of revision), and even for book I redaction A was di ff erent from redaction B. 101 Redaction A of book I, therefore, is no longer accessible to us. Th ence, we can surmise that what Bernard Lombardi reports is the content of a question of the now lost redaction A of distinction 17 in which Durand was adopting the succession theory. 102\n\nAs a matter of fact, the reversal of Koch's conclusion gives grounds for a very plausible scenario. It would be only logical that the young Durand, while he was fi rst studying in Paris between 1300 and 1303, under the in fl uence of James of Metz, adopted the succession theory. When he came back to Paris to comment on the Sentences , at the beginning of the academic year 1308-09, he held the same position while lecturing on d. 17 of book I and immediately clashed with Hervaeus on the topic of intensi fi cation among others. As noted above, Hervaeus' Quodlibet II was probably disputed either during the Advent of 1308,\n\n101. Pp. 20*-75* (see summary in Andreas Speer's 'Vorwort,' pp. 10*-11*). See also F. R etucci , 'Selected Problems in Books I-II of Durand's Sentences Commentary,' in A. S peer - F . R etucci - T. J eschke - G. G uldentops (eds.), Durand of Saint-Pourçain and his Sentences commentary , pp. 71-96, and M. P errone , 'Alcune osservazioni sulle fasi redazionali del Commento al I libro delle Sentenze di Durando di San Porciano (1270/75-1334),' Studi Filosofici XXXIX (2016), pp. 49-68. On pp. 59-60 of this article, Perrone shows that, because of an implicit quote from the second redaction of Alexander of Alexandria's commentary on the Sentences , Durand must have revised book I after 1308.\n\n102. I should add that Lombardi does not always report the content of redaction A. Immediately after this passage, art. 2 of the same question ('Quae est causa precisa susceptionis magis et minus') is nothing but a transcription word for word of q. 6 of Durand's redaction C (probably because in this final version, Durand criticizes the explanation he had given earlier-i.e., redaction B, book I, d. 17, q. 3, ed. P errone - R etucci , pp. 246249-about the reasons why certain forms are intensifiable and remittable). I'll comment more on this fact in the conclusion. For now, let me just emphasize that Bernard had access to  different  redactions  of  Durand's  commentary (Durand's concern over leaving a definitive version that would be clearly recognizable probably shows that he feared that the earlier drafts were still in circulation-see above, fn. 96, the quote from the conclusion of Durand's Commentary ,  which is to be completed by these words: 'propter quod hoc opus solum, quod per omnes libros incipit 'Est Deus in caelo revelans etc.' tanquam per me editum et correctum approbo'). Incidentally, this means that, for the discussion of the 'how' of intensification/remission (art. 1), Lombardi chose Durand's solution in redaction A, while he knew redaction C (in which Durand has somehow modified his view; see below p. 339). Why? Probably because Bernard, who rallies to Hervaeus' solution in Quodlibet II which he copies extensively in art. 1, wanted to give the whole context of Hervaeus' question 13, in which Durand was involved.\n\nor Lent of 1309. Admittedly, Hervaeus, in the question on intensi fi cation  (q.  13), fi rst  addresses  a  more  important  adversary: Th omas of Bailly, as I noted above. But recall the peculiar structure of the question: towards the end of the second part, it appears that an opponent (or several opponents) raises a series of twelve new objections that favor the succession theory. Now, eight of these objections are arguments for the succession theory that Bernard Lombardi ascribes to Durand (from the corresponding question in redaction A, if my hypothesis is correct). So it is not too far-fetched to imagine that Durand himself, or perhaps a student of his who had taken notes on his recent lecture on the intensi fi cation and remission of qualities, might have intervened in the discussion of Hervaeus' quodlibetal question and put forward these objections. It wouldn't be the only time that Durand would have debated with Hervaeus: together with an important question on cognition from Durand's early version of the Commentary on the Sentences , Koch has edited a disputed question presided over by Hervaeus in which, Koch says, Durand, defending the same theses as in his Commentary , played the role of the opponent. 103 And as we know, a number of other questions of Hervaeus' Quodlibet II  were speci fi cally targeting Durand. 104 To these questions that reveal the increasing tension between Hervaeus and Durand, it seems permissible, therefore, to add the end of q. 13.\n\nFurthermore, as said above, Durand had to modify his commentary on the Sentences to  align it more with Dominican orthodoxy, that is to say, with Th omas Aquinas's teachings. During this process, which resulted  in  redaction  B,  Durand  omitted  whole  questions  that  were too controversial, with the consequence that redaction B is generally a shortened text compared to the initial version. 105 Th at is exactly what happened with the question on the 'how' of the intensi fi cation, where Durand had to criticize Aquinas in order to promote the succession theory: he purely and simply eliminated it from redaction B, with the result that, as noted above, redaction B does not o ff er any explanation about the manner in which an intensi fi cation or remission takes place.\n\n103.

See above, fn. 97.\n\nOne manuscript of redaction B mentions this disappearance. BnF lat. 14454, f. 62 vb, at the end of d. 17 (after the question 'Utrum caritas possit minui'), has in the lower margin, apparently from the same hand as the main text, the following note: 'due questiones de fi ciunt hic, scilicet  utrum caritas augeatur per additionem aut alio modo et utrum possit augeri in in fi nitum.' Th is  note  does  not  result  from  a comparison made by the scribe with the text of redaction C, for the latter includes not just two more questions on the increase of charity than the non-C (i.e. redaction B) manuscripts have, but four more-and indeed many more as far as the whole distinction 17 is concerned. 106 Th e annotator of BnF lat. 14454, therefore, had a source of information other than a redaction C manuscript. Like Bernard Lombardi, he probably had access to redaction A and reported that these two questions were missing in Durand's revised version. It seems that all the elements fi t nicely in the scenario I have proposed.\n\nLet us now turn to the arguments ascribed to Durand by Bernard Lombardi.\n\nTh e fi rst argument is the 8 th fi nal objection in Hervaeus' Quodlibet II q. 13. It is formally identical to Godfrey's third argument ( G3 above), and James's third argument too ( J3 above):\n\nDBL1 : In all processes, the terminus a quo disappears when the terminus ad quem is reached. 107\n\nTh is argument is the cornerstone of Godfrey's position, and it is used by all of his followers, who also believe that intensi fi cation and remission are processes like any other process. Th ese limited alterations obey the laws that apply to all natural changes, therefore they must be seen\n\n106. See the chart in P errone ' s and R etucci ' s introduction, pp. 71*-73*. One should note, however, that the content of what is q. 6 in redaction C is part of q. 3 in redaction B. The count of the number of questions, by the way, may provide another confirmation that the extant non-C manuscripts of book I carry its redaction B version, not the redaction A version: see the Appendix, below.\n\n107. L ombardi , I Sent. ,  d. 17 q. 1, a. 1, mss.

II q. 13, f. 60 va, 8°: ' in omni motu abiicitur terminus a quo ; sed in motu intensionis terminus a quo est forma remissa ; igitur in tali motu forma remissa abiicitur , et per consequens non manet eadem cum intensa.'\n\nas a succession of transitory states between the initial and fi nal states of rest, which are contrary to each other and mutually exclusive. However, the conclusion of DBL1 talks of degrees , rather than forms, replacing each other. Recall that Durand, contrary to Godfrey, a ffi rmed that essences are divisible in degrees. Th is is why his theory is that of a succession of degrees, strictly speaking, instead of forms. Th e nuance is not always perceptible in Lombardi's account, but it will become much clearer in redaction C, as we'll see below.\n\nNext, Lombardi ascribes to Durand a con fi rmation of the previous argument,  which  is  identical  to  the  4 th fi nal  objection  in  Hervaeus' Quodlibet :\n\nDBL1' : Either a new degree succeeds to the previous one (instead of being an addition), which was to be demonstrated; or the previous one stays, and thus the form remains unchanged, which is false. 108\n\nTh e next argument of Durand reported by Lombardi, related to Godfrey's second argument ( G2 above), is identical to the 1 st fi nal objection in Hervaeus' Quodlibet :\n\nDBL2 : An agent that intensi fi es heat in a patient either acts and actualizes ('imprints') something in the patient, or not. Th e second alternative is impossible, because this would mean that nothing happens in reality. However, if the agent does act, it imprints something that was not there already, otherwise there would be no change either. But if what is imprinted is a new degree or form, the degree or form that was previously in the patient cannot subsist. 109\n\n108. L ombardi ,  Leipzig f. 37 ra, Erfurt f. 91 vb: 'Et confirmatur: si  intensum habet plus quam remissum, aut hoc est succedente gradu gradui, aut manente forma .

II q. 13, f. 60 va, 4°: 's i intensum habet plus quam remissum, aut est hoc succedente forma forme, aut manente eadem forma. Si primo modo, habetur propositum, scilicet quod intensum et remissum sunt diverse forme. Si secundo modo, tunc nulla est ibi variatio. '\n\n109. L ombardi , Leipzig f. 37 ra, Erfurt f. 91 vb: 'Secundo sic: intendens calorem aut aliquid imprimit aut nihil . Non potest dici quod nihil, quia per nihil calor non dicitur augmentari; ergo aliquid imprimit. Sed non illud quod iam erat. Ergo aliud.' H ervaeus N atalis , Quodl . II q. 13, f. 60 rb, 1°: 'agens intendens aut imprimit aliquid diuersum a precedente, aut non . Si non , igitur nulla variatio est in intensione, quod est contra sensum. Si sic , igitur forma intensa quam imprimit est diversa a precedente , et ex hoc ulterius sequitur quod ista remissa corrumpitur , quia due forme eiusdem speciei non simul sunt in eodem subiecto.'\n\nTh is argument is followed by a variant, which should be compared to James of Metz's 4th argument (J4 above), and is identical to the 7 th fi nal objection in Hervaeus' Quodlibet :\n\nDBL2' : Suppose that something cold diminishes heat in something else. Either the fi rst thing imprints something, or not. Th e second is impossible, because the agent does act. But what it imprints can only be a diminished heat, which cannot coexist with the initial heat. 110\n\nHowever, as we saw above, James eventually found that this argument entailed an unsolvable problem: it is impossible for the property actualized in the patient to be the opposite of that possessed by the agent, and both the Correctorium fratris Jacobi and Hervaeus in his Sentences commentary exploit the concession made by James ( NO2 and CR4 / NR4 above). Th e same objection to the succession theory fi gures also at  the  beginning of the second part of Hervaeus' Quodlibet II q.  13 (before the twelve fi nal objection), 111 with the discussion of counterarguments. One of these counter-arguments is that there is an order in which forms have to appear, with the consequence that a subject cannot change immediately from one extreme to the other but has to go through intermediaries. Th us, in the example above, cold cannot be introduced immediately in the patient; a less intense heat must be fi rst imprinted by the agent. Th is counter-argument seems to echo the econd solution envisioned by James, as we saw above, to solve the 'ras tio di ffi cilior' (the example given was that of the semen). 112 Hervaeus gives immediately three replies to this counter-argument:\n\n110. L ombardi , Leipzig f. 37 ra, Erfurt f. 91 vb: 'Vel potest sic formari ratio: frigidum remittens calidum aut aliquid imprimit aut nihil. Si imprimit aliquid, hoc non potest esse nisi calor remissus, quia si imprimeret intensum, tunc non remitteret primum sed intenderet, vel duo calores simul essent intensi , quod est falsum, sic autem non maneret calor intensus. Si autem nihil imprimeret, ergo nihil ageret quod est falsum.' H ervaeus N atalis , Quodl . II q. 13, f. 60 va, 7°: ' frigidum remittens calidum aut aliquid imprimit aut nihil. Si aliquid, hoc non potest esse nisi calor remissus, nec potest de nouo imprimere calorem remissum &lt; corr. ex intensum&gt; nisi remouendo calorem intensum &lt; corr. ex remissum&gt;, quia aliter duo calores simul essent . Si dicatur quod nihil imprimit, contra : quia si nihil imprimit, nihil agit , et sic agens remittens nihil agit.'\n\n111. Ff. 59vb - 60ra.\n\n- A univocal agent must be proportioned to its e ff ect; but cold is not suited to actualize heat, albeit a diminished heat at the fi rst stage of its action. - Is the more intense heat expelled in an instant or progressively? If the second, then some of the intense heat remains together with the less intense heat that is being introduced; but these forms belong to the same species and therefore cannot be numerically di ff erent and be in the same subject at the same time; therefore, they are in reality one and the same form. If, on the contrary, the more intense heat is expelled in an instant, then the diminished heat is introduced in an instant too, and this alteration is not continuous.\n\n- Likewise, is the very introduction of the lesser degree of heat successive or not? If not, this is contrary to empirical evidence. But if it is successive, does this lesser degree of heat, while it is being introduced, remain equal ( eque remissa ) or not? If yes, this again is contrary to empirical evidence. If not, then this means that the intensity of one and the same form can diminish. Th erefore, why couldn't this be extended to the whole process of remission (or intensi fi cation), from lesser heat to lesser heat?\n\nNow, the same discussion re-occurs at the end of Hervaeus' question, since, as we just saw, the 7 th objection to Hervaeus' position (identical to DBL2' in favor of the succession theory) reactivates James's argument ( J4 ). Th is reappearance of the problem con fi rms, I believe, that the series of the twelve fi nal objections is superadded and that a new opponent has entered the lists. 113\n\nTh e next argument attributed to Durand by Bernard is, like the 5 th and 6 th fi nal objections in Hervaeus' Quodlibet ,  a  direct attack on his own theory. Since Hervaeus thinks that degrees do not succeed each other, and do not add up cumulatively either (as in the addition theory), he has no other avenue left but saying that, in an intensi fi cation process, the degrees acquired do not complement the previous degrees like parts added to parts in order to constitute a new whole, but, rather, include them 'virtually' (this is also true of remission: the initial, higher degree being virtually contained in the lower degree too). As we saw, this notion of 'virtual inclusion' was already the linchpin of Hervaeus' solution in his Sentences commentary. All his  responses  to  arguments  supporting\n\nthe succession theory hinge on it too. 114 As already explained, the model Hervaeus o ff ered is that of nutrition: the nutrients are assimilated, but they remain distinct virtually or by habitus from the body, in the sense that they still could exist apart. 115 In his Quodlibet III q. 15, Th omas of Bailly challenged the appropriateness of this model, probably in reaction to Hervaeus' lecture on the Sentences . Nevertheless, in his Quodlibet II (before the fi nal twelve objections), Hervaeus retains the same solution. Th e intensi fi ed di ff ers from the remitted, he says, as being the same entity plus something else, not as if these were two actually distinguishable parts, but as a more perfect whole comprises a plurality. 116\n\nFrom DBL3 and the 5 th -6 th fi nal objections in Hervaeus' Quodlibet II ,  we  learn  that  Durand questioned the very principle of Hervaeus' solution, namely, that because their relation is a virtual inclusion, the initial degree and the fi nal degree of a quality do not di ff er really as two distinct entities do:\n\n114. See above, pp. 310, 317, at fn. 49 and 68. The same notion is also part of Hervaeus' defense against arguments in favor of the addition theory. For instance, the first objection in I Sent. , d. 17 q. 5, p. 96b, contends that if A is 'more' than B, A can be divided into two parts, the part that is equal to B and the part by which A exceeds B; but what can be divided into two parts must be constituted by the addition of these two parts. The conclusion, Hervaeus responds ( ad 1 m , p. 98a), is true only when the two parts can be distinguished in actuality, either by their subject or by their situs ; not so in the case of qualities, where the parts differ only virtualiter .\n\n116. F . 60 rb: 'Qualiter autem precedens et sequens sint unum vel etiam differant, dico sicut alius dixi, quod ipsum intensum differt a remisso precedente sicut ipsum habens et plus, non secundum partes singulares ita quod una possit signanter distingui ab alia, sed sicut totum perfectionale comprehendens aliqua, non sicut partes signabiles distinctas. Et de hoc posui duo exempla alibi. Primum est de conversione materiae alimenti in nutritum, ubi materia adveniens non potest signanter distingui a precedente. Et similiter quando pellis efficitur maior per extensionem, maioritas adveniens non potest distingui a precedente, et idem est si hoc fiat per rarefactionem, quia corpus rarefactum fit maius, et maioritas adveniens non potest distingui secundum quantitatem.' Note that Hervaeus says that he has already offered two examples elsewhere. The first one, nutrition, is in his Sentences commentary, as I just said. I don't know where else he offered the example of the stretching of a skin. However, this model is akin to that of rarefaction he used in his Sentences commentary (see above, fn. 49), because in both cases what is added cannot be distinguished in actuality from what it is added to.\n\n115. See above CR1 and CR1' , in the discussion of James of Metz by the Correctorium . H ervaeus , Sent. , p. 98a: '(…) si non fuisset praecedens habitus gradus, agens fecisset qualitatem aliam: sicut quando alimentum est conversum in illum qui nutritur, materia alimenti facta conversione, non est aliquid distinctum actu ab ista materia, sed habitu potest alia dici, quia si per se fuisset, habuisset per se distinctum.' See also H ervaeus , Quodl. VI q.11, f. 135 vb: 'materia alimenti, facta conuersione eius in nutritum, non distinguitur a reliqua materia nutriti et essentialiter, sed habitu potest dici distincta pro tanto quia fuit uel potuit esse alia. Ita dico de illo gradu acquisito in forma intensa quod est quidem distinctus habitu a forma preexistente, in quantum si agens inuenisset subiectum carens illa forma, causasset ibi gradum quemdam qui non fuisset illa forma sed alia, sed presupposita ibi consimili forma actu non potuit distingui ab ea.'\n\nDBL3 : What is virtually included in a thing is really distinct from that thing. For instance, an e ff ect, which is virtually contained in its cause, is really distinct from the latter; such is obviously the case for creatures with respect to God. 117\n\nTh en, Bernard Lombardi ascribes to Durand an argument that is related to the 10 th fi nal objection in Hervaeus' Quodlibet based on the notion of 'incompatible changes.' Whereas the phrasing of DBL4 is obscure, though, the thrust of the 10 th objection is clear:\n\nDBL4 :  Incompatible  changes  are  linked  to  incompatible  forms,  given that a change is de fi ned by the form that is acquired at the end of the process.  But  intensi fi cation  and  remission  are  completely  incompatible changes. Th erefore, the remitted form and the intensi fi ed form must be ncompatible too. As a consequence, they cannot be the same form. i 118\n\nTh e next argument too appeals to the principle of non-contradiction:\n\nDBL5 : In an intensi fi cation, one goes from the 'non esse intensum' to the 'esse intensum,' which are the two extremes of the change. If the lower and the higher degree were the same form, the 'non esse intensum' and\n\n117. L ombardi , Leipzig f. 37ra, f. Erfurt f. 91vb: 'Tertio sic: si forma remissa et intensa sunt eadem, aut intensa remanet virtualiter in remissa aut formaliter. Non formaliter quia falsum est quod intensum sit remissum formaliter; nec virtualiter quia illa que continentur in aliquo virtualiter differunt realiter ab illo , sicut patet de effectu qui realiter differt a causa in qua continetur .  Et  sic  habetur propositum, scilicet quod remissum differt ab intenso.' H ervaeus N atalis , Quodl .

L ombardi , Leipzig 37ra, Erfurt 91vb: 'Quarto sic: si intensum et remissum essent idem, tunc sequeretur quod motus incompossibiles essent simul, scilicet intensionis et remissionis. Sed per nullam potentiam motus incompossibiles possunt esse simul; ergo. Maior patet quia tunc motus intensionis et remissionis essent simul.' H ervaeus N atalis , Quodl . II q. 13, f. 60va, 10°: ' motus incompossibiles debent esse secundum formas incompossibiles; sed motus intensionis et remissionis sunt incompossibiles secundum se totos; ergo et forma intensa et remissa sunt incompossibiles, et per consequens non potest esse eadem forma.'\n\nthe 'esse intensum,' which are opposites, would be the same thing. Th is would violate the principle of non-contradiction. 119\n\nA variant of this argument is identical to the 9 th fi nal objection in Hervaeus' Quodlibet II :\n\nDBL5' : A remission unfolds in the direction of the non-being of the form that is diminished. Correspondingly, an intensi fi cation moves away from this non-being. But this non-being precisely is the remitted form. Th e latter, therefore, cannot be the same form as the one that is acquired by the intensi fi cation. 120\n\nTh e  correspondence  between  these  eight  arguments  in  the  total  ascribed to Durand by Bernard Lombardi, and eight of the objections met by Hervaeus Natalis in his quodlibetal question shows su ffi ciently,\n\n119. L ombardi , Leipzig 37ra-rb, Erfurt 91vb: 'Quinto sic: quando in motu intensionis receditur a non esse intenso, fit accessus ad esse intensum. Si ergo idem essent intensum et remissum, idem essent non esse intensum et esse intensum, quod implicat contradictionem.' 120. L ombardi , Erfurt f. 91vb: 'Vel formatur sic: sicut in remissione tenditur ad priuationem et ad non esse forme que remittitur, ita in intensione receditur a priuatione et a non esse forme que intenditur. Sed in remissione tenditur ad non esse forme que remittitur , ergo in intensione forme tenditur ad esse forme que acquiritur; et per consequens illa que acquiritur per intensionem non preexistebat . Sed huius&lt;modi&gt; non esse est forma remissa, ergo ipsa per intensionem non est que acquiritur.' H ervaeus N atalis , Quodl . II q. 13, f. 60va, 9°: ' sicut in remissione tenditur ad privationem et non esse, ita in intensione receditur a privatione et non esse. Sed in remissione tenditur ad non esse forme que acquiritur, et per consequens illa forma que acquiritur per intensionem non preexistebat, nec est eadem cum preexistente, nec per consequens cum forma remissa.' This argument may help illuminating the strange opening of John (Quidort) of Paris' Quodlibet I q. 8 (ed. A. H eiman , 'The First Quodlibet of Jean Quidort,' in: J.R. O'D onnell (ed.), Nine Mediaeval Thinkers. A Collection of Hitherto Unedited Texts, Toronto 1955, pp. 284-286). The question asked is: 'Utrum aliquid positivum possit produci a non ente.' John begins his reply with the explanation that the real question that was hiding behind the formulated question is whether a quality intensified is numerically the same as the remitted quality ('Ex verbis argumentis non apparebat ejus intentio; sed, ut dictum fuit mihi, intendit quaerere utrum qualitas intensa et remissa sit eadem numero vel diversa.') At first sight, the connection is not obvious (all the more that John does not directly respond to the question as formulated, but only to the background question and the classical arguments for the succession theory), but in the light of Durand's argument against Hervaeus, it makes sense that someone who roots for the succession theory would launch an attack on John by asking him whether the being of an intensified form can come from the non-being of that same form, assuming that numerically the same form remains along the process of intensification. Given that John's Quodlibet was held in 1304 or 1305, and clearly replies to Thomas of Bailly's Quodl. III q. 15 and his response to the infinity objection, this shows that the argument was in circulation before Durand's Parisian lectures on the Sentences .\n\nI  think,  that  Durand  was  involved  in  the  debate,  and  that  his  take on the intensi fi cation/remission problem before and around 1308 was close to the succession theory, even though Durand gave it a twist of his own. Lombardi's report points to Durand as the source of opposition at the end of Hervaeus' dispute; conversely, the historical plausibility of Durand disputing with Hervaeus validates Lombardi's report of Durand standing for the succession theory. Th e two presumptions reinforce each other, so to speak. Th is stage of Durand's thought can be known only indirectly (so far), and must have been contained in a question of the lost redaction A, that was left out of redaction B.\n\n## 6 . D urands ' R edaction C\n\nNow, Hervaeus Natalis did perhaps not argue totally in vain. Th e fi nal version of Durand's Sentences commentary seems to indicate that he somewhat changed his mind on the topic. Following Koch's conclusions, it  is  generally  held  that  in  redaction  C,  bishop  Durand, freed from the Dominican order's control, went back to the boldness of redaction A and reasserted his controversial theses. Th is may be mostly true, but it is not always the case. One example is Durand's position on the generation of the Son in the T rinity (book I, dist. 5). 121 Th e way in which intensi fi cation or remission occur is another case in point. Q. 7 of dist. 17, in redaction C, 'Utrum eadem forma possit esse intensa et  remissa,'  begins  with fi ve quod non arguments  for  the  succession theory, which are exactly those ascribed to Durand by Lombardi; but Durand is going to respond in the a ffi rmative and maintain that the same form remains along the process. Moreover, the sed contra repeats nearly  word  for  word  some  of  Hervaeus'  arguments  in  his Sentences commentary and his Quodlibet II! 122 Th is is why Bernard Lombardi's report on Durand's position cannot have been derived from redaction C: in the fi nal version, the arguments have been reshu ffl ed.\n\nNonetheless, in the end Durand still defends a form of the succession theory. But he has made a major adjustment-or clari fi cation. Let us see how.\n\n- 121. See F . R etucci , 'Selected problems…,' p. 95, fn. 51.\n\n122. The second argument of the sed contra comes from Quodl . II , f. 59 vb, the first one is the infinity problem (see NO1 above), the third one is the cooling down problem (see NO2 above).\n\nDurand breaks down the discussion into three questions: 1. Does an intensi fi ed form remain numerically one (nn. 10-12)? 2. If it remains numerically one, is it one because of a unity of indivisibility, or because of a unity of continuity (nn. 13-15)? 3. If it is because of a unity of continuity, are its parts distinguishable ( signabiles ) or not (nn. 16-39)?\n\n- 1. Durand immediately concedes that if the alteration by which a form is intensi fi ed is a real, i.e. continuous change, necessarily this form is numerically one. As a matter of fact, within one and the same process of change, four parameters, namely, the mobile, the duration, the form in fl ux ( forma fl uens ), and the end point of the change, must each be numerically the same. Otherwise, the alleged change would actually be a series of mutations. Th us, Durand clearly distances himself from Godfrey's or James's thesis of numerically distinct forms replacing each other. Th is is the essential modi fi cation introduced in redaction C, unless it is only a clari fi cation, since, as we saw above, there was in redaction A some ambiguity (at least according to Lombardi's report) on whether the degrees that succeed each other are taken to be distinct forms. Nonetheless, even if it is a mere clari fi cation, it amounts, from Godfrey's perspective, to a major concession to the opponents of his theory: one and the same form remains through the whole change.\n- 2. Next, however, Durand speci fi es that indivisibility is not the reason why the intensi fi ed form is one. Rather, the form is one by continuity. He argues that the intensi fi ed form cannot be indivisible because an indivisible cannot be acquired successively, but only at once ('tota simul'), whereas it is clear that an intensi fi cation or remission is progressive. Th erefore, an intensi fi able form must allow for parts or degrees  that  are  actualized  progressively.  Nonetheless,  the  numerical unity of this form is guaranteed by the continuity of the progress. Th e unity of the forma fl uens is the same as that of the change itself ( fl uxus formae ); but change is one by the continuity of its parts; therefore, the same must apply to the form that is acquired.\n\n3. So far, Durand has manifested not so much his disagreement with Hervaeus as with the older Th omist view (i.e., that of Giles of Rome and Godfrey), on which all forms are simple and indivisible entities. But how are these forms divisible? Here the di ff erence with Hervaeus becomes visible. For the latter, these forms are divisible into degrees that contain each other virtually, as we know. For Durand, they are divisible into degrees that succeed each other.\n\nDurand fi rst summarizes Hervaeus' answer: the intensi fi ed form differs from what it was previously by being what it was plus something more that it has acquired; however, these parts are not determinable ( signabiles ) parts, such that one can be distinguished from the other. 123 Durand harshly criticizes this idea. First, it contradicts Aquinas's doctrine, which it is supposed to defend, as Durand is happy to emphasize (and he certainly has a point, here). 124 It comes down to admitting that the intensi fi cation of the form happens by addition of something new, which is precisely what Aquinas disagreed with. Second, this idea is erroneous. An addition, or even more simply a composition, can happen only between things that are distinct by a distinction stronger that a distinction of reason. 125 But two accidents of the same kind cannot be in the same subject at the same time. Th ey cannot merge, because all forms are actuality, and actuality separates and distinguishes. Th ere would be a multiplication of qualities, instead of the augmentation of a  quality. 126 Ironically,  Durand  uses  fundamental  tenets  of  Aquinas's ontology against Hervaeus, self-proclaimed defender of the Th omistic orthodoxy. It is worth noting that Th omas of Bailly employs the same argument, and this might have been directed against Hervaeus, or at least against a theory that tries to explain how new degrees could coexist with previous degrees and somehow merge with them. 127\n\nAdmittedly, all this does not apply to nutrition, but this is precisely why nutrition cannot be a paradigm for the intensi fi cation/remission process, contrary to what Hervaeus claims. As opposed to forms, a part of matter doesn't distinguish itself from another part of matter (both being per se mere potentiality). Th is is why the matter of a nutrient can unite to the matter of the body. 128\n\n123. See above p. 310, and DBL3 , p. 332.\n\n125. Ibid ., n. 19, f. 59 va: 'realis additio est realiter diversorum.

A greater extension results from the stretching, but not because a new quantity is added to the previous quantity. As in melting wax, the parts that beforehand were superposed now touch each other by their sides (this is why the skin or the wax become less dense and thinner). 129\n\nIn sum, Durand objects that if the fi rst  degrees  of  the  intensi fi ed form remain when new degrees are acquired, they will not be able to unite with each other, and the numerical unity of the form will not be preserved (an argument that could be directed against the addition theory as well). On this count too, Durand is on the same line as Th omas of Bailly, against Hervaeus. 130 Th e only solution, therefore, is that these parts replace each other in a succession. Paradoxically, the succession theory comes to the help of the numerical unity of the whole form.\n\nHow distinct are these degrees of a form? If by signabiles one means continuous parts that can co-exist together, then the degrees of a form are not signabiles , because it is impossible for the same form to be at the same time less intense and more intense, that is to say, to have simultaneously two degrees. In a broader sense, though, signabiles parts are parts that have real di ff erences: one is not the other, even though they are parts of a same whole numerically one-without, naturally, existing simultaneously. In that sense, the successive degrees in an intensi fi cation are the signabiles parts of one and the same form, which, with respect to the totality of the change process, is one by continuity of these parts. 131 (I am not sure, however, that this notion of parts or degrees of a form is any better de fi ned than in the addition theory.)\n\nTh us,  Durand keeps the idea of succession, even though for him there is corruption and replacement not of individual forms, but only of successive degrees within the same, numerically one form. Th is  is why, perhaps surprisingly at this point, he eventually o ff ers three arguments in favor of the succession thesis-two of which are traceable to redaction A, James of Metz, and Godfrey-followed by the answers that Hervaeus had given to each and by a rebuttal of these answers. 132\n\n129.

See ibid ., n. 39, f. 60 rb: 'T enendum est ergo quod forma&lt;e&gt; intensa&lt;e&gt; et remissa&lt;e&gt; acquisitae per motum possunt esse partes unius formae numero, et quae non est una indivisibilitate, sed continuitate suarum partium quae non sunt simul, sed successive et una superveniente alia desinit esse et hoc modo signari possunt.'\n\n130. See T homas de B ailly Quodl. III q. 15, p. 216.\n\n132.\n\nIbid\n\n., nn. 26-38, f. 60 ra-rb.\n\nTh e fi rst argument is identical to G3 J3 DBL1 / / : 'In omni motu terminus a quo abiicitur et terminus ad quem acquiritur.' Hervaeus had answered that in an intensi fi cation the terminus a quo is not the form itself, but the privation of the perfection that constitutes the terminus ad quem ; obviously, this privation is eliminated, but this does not mean that the form is eliminated too and has to be replaced by another. 133 Th is reply, Durand objects, is worthless. His fi rst two objections emphasize the fact that the intensi fi cation process acts on the preexisting form, not on the privation. 134 His third reason is that the terminus a quo of an intensi fi cation is the terminus ad quem of a remission, and this terminus ad quem cannot be a privation, but has to be an existing form.\n\nTh e  second  argument  is  identical  to G2 J2 DBL2 / / :  the  agent  must imprint  something  other  than  what  existed  beforehand.  Hervaeus  had answered that the agent makes the form that existed beforehand more perfect; the result is only a di ff erence between the less perfect and the more perfect, not of a di ff erence between two forms. 135 As we saw with DBL2 , Durand objects that this argument is inconsistent with Hervaeus' own affi rmations. Hervaeus argued that in nutrition, the matter of the nutrient does not just perfect the matter of the body, but is added to it. According to the parallel drawn by Hervaeus himself, the intensi fi ed form should likewise not just perfect the previous form, but be added to it (or a new degree be added to the same form in a lesser degree). Moreover, if the agent does not actualize anything new, it makes the patient more perfect while doing nothing, which is absurd. 136 Th e perfection is nothing but the form; if some perfection is added, this means that the essence is modi fi ed. 137\n\nTh e third argument reiterates the fundamental principle that a variation in perfection is a variation of the essence, which entails that an intensi fi ed or remitted form is not the same form that existed before. 138 Hervaeus replied that the form remains what it is, even though the form as more intense contains more perfection than the same form\n\n133.

Ibid ., n. 36, f. 60rb: '(…) essentia essentialiter variata non est eadem essentia (…) ergo forma intensa et remissa non sunt eadem essentia.'\n\nas less intense. Durand becomes caustic here. Th is response is evasive, frivolous,  and  purely  verbal,  he  says. 139 Again,  the  perfection  of  the form is equivalent to the very essence of the form; modifying one is modifying the other. Here too, Durand may have taken note of Bailly's earlier rebuttal of Hervaeus. 140\n\nHowever, after this development that might pass for an unconditional defense of Godfrey's theory, Durand takes care to give his considered position on the succession thesis, in response to the opening arguments of the whole question (the fi ve arguments that were reported by Lombardi as being Durand's own and are now in the quod non ):\n\n' Th e main arguments submitted to establish that a remitted form and an intensi fi ed form are not numerically the same, must be accepted insofar as they prove that the intensi fi ed form and the remitted form exclude each other, like the parts of a successive continuity (…) but they do not prove that the total form of which they are parts is not numerically one by continuity.' 141\n\nIn other words, Durand continues to endorse the argumentative core of the succession theory, but makes clear that he places the succession within the same form, as a succession of degrees of intensity of that form (a succession, not an accumulation or addition of degrees), rather than between fullyfl edged individual forms. Again, this may be a mere clari fi cation of what he was already writing in redaction A or objecting to Hervaeus at the time of the latter's Quodlibet II , although nothing in the extant texts or testimonies clearly con fi rms this possibility. Alternatively, it may be an important modi fi cation, due to Hervaeus' or others' criticisms.\n\nNonetheless,  because  he  endorses  a  form  of  succession,  Durand has to respond to the objections raised against the tenets of Godfrey's theory,  even  though  these  responses  must  be  understood  within  the framework of Durand's own solution.\n\n139.

To the in fi nity objection: 142 Just as in any motion and any continuum there is an in fi nity of parts in potentiality, likewise, in a form that is intensi fi ed there is an in fi nity of partial forms which, by their continuity, compose the total form that is acquired by the totality of the motion.\n- 2. To the discontinuity objection: 143 Th e remitted form that was in the subject before the beginning of change is expelled in an instant, but the next form is introduced not in an instant, but progressively.\n- 3. To  the  active  agent  objection: 144 Th e  cold  that  diminishes  heat does imprint something; it does not do so just by itself, however, but with the heat which co-acts and preserves the diminished degree of heat.\n\n## C onclusion\n\nTh e previous pages have depicted the liveliness of some of the debates about the intensi fi cation/remission of forms at the very beginning of the 14 th century. Even though the topic seems today obscure and idle, it was obviously of great interest to the medievals, since they did not hesitate to return to it tirelessly and were keen on criticizing each other's errors on the matter. Th e in fl uence of Godfrey of Fontaines has been highlighted. Hervaeus did all he could to push back against it, but James of Metz and Th omas of Bailly, among others, spread his thesis. Durand too defended it against Hervaeus, and I have shown that he probably did so directly as an interlocutor in Nédellec's second Quodlibet , in concordance with a question of the fi rst redaction of his Sentences commentary, which has now disappeared but is echoed by Bernard Lombardi. Durand's considered position in the third redaction of his Sentences commentary, however, is unique. Even though some of his views seem close to Bailly's, in the end his theory is quite di ff erent. For Bailly, as for Godfrey, there is no doubt that the intensi fi ed form does not remain numerically the same, and that each degree corresponds to a distinct form which is actualized and then eliminated as long as the process goes on. 145 By contrast,\n\n142. See NO1 above, p. 314.\n\n144. See NO2 above, p. 315.\n\n143. See CO1 above, p. 314.\n\n145. See T homas de B ailly , Quodl. III q. 15, 4 th argument, p. 210: 'Ergo patet quod illa  forma  secundum  quam  est  motus  est  alia  et  alia  realiter  secundum  diuersas  partes motus, que tamen non possunt esse simul; adueniente secunda corrumpitur prima (…).'\n\nDurand o ff ers a sort of compromise, in which he abandons Godfrey's most controversial claim, namely, that the same form does not remain throughout its intensi fi cation or remission. He seems to have accepted some of the criticisms that had been addressed to Godfrey's theory. Nevertheless, Durand uses Godfrey's, James's, and Bailly's arguments to support his own view of a succession of degrees in the same form.\n\nIn closing, it is worth mentioning a fact that highlights Durand's infl uence within the Dominican order despite the troubles he ran into. At the end of his account of Durand's position, Bernard Lombardi confesses that the succession theory once strongly appealed to him and that he eventually rejected it only for a theological reason that involves the transubstantiation  dogma. 146 Furthermore,  the  next  article  of  Lombardi's question (art. 2: 'Que est causa precisa susceptionis magis et minus'), is, as I noted above, 147 nothing but the transcription, word for word, of Durand's q. 6 in redaction C. 148 As in the case of James of Lausanne, 149 one of the Dominicans who was supposed to be Durand's nemesis does not hesitate to copy him from start to fi nish, just short of presenting him as an authority on the question. Th is fact may encourage us to look more carefully at Durand's very special place in the Dominican order. 150\n\n146. Dist. 17, q. 1, Leipzig f. 38 ra: 'Ista opinio que est ultimo posita [i.e. Hervaei Natalis] tenetur propter illam rationem fidei supra predictam de speciebus sacramentalibus adductam alias [contra Durandum add . Naples). Tamen fuit visum mihi oppositum, scilicet quod forma intensa et remissa distinguantur realiter (…).' Bernard refers to an earlier passage of the question (Leipzig f. 37rb): 'Istam opinionem [i.e. Durandi] non teneo propter unam rationem que sit de speciebus in sacramento altaris que talis est: variatis speciebus in acramento altaris secundum numerum desinit ibi esse corpus Christi. Hoc patet per fidem. s Sed stante corpore Christi vero in speciebus potest fieri in speciebus raritas et densitas, vel densatio et rarefactio que sunt passiones quantitatis. Ergo rarum et densum non differunt secundum numerum et per consequens nec intensum nec remissum.'\n\n148. At least in the Erfurt and Leipzig manuscripts.

B s n F L at . 15364 and the Q uestion of the T hree R edactions of D urands ' C ommentary on the SENTENCES .\n\nJosef  Koch has shown that the manuscript kept in the Bibliothèque Nationale de France under the shelf mark Lat. 15364 does not contain the Additiones to the fi rst redaction of Durand's commentary on book I of the Sentences mentioned by Durandellus 151 but that both the main text of book I (f. 2va-66va) and the Additiones (f. 67ra-91ra) are part of redaction C. 152 Th erefore, for Koch, this manuscript was at most a witness  of  Durand's  composition  method: while preparing the third redaction, Durand added a series of additional questions to a fi rst draft of the fi rst book.\n\nHowever, P .T. Stella has shown that Koch was mistaken when affi rming that these Additiones were additions to the 'new scriptum on the fi rst book of the Sentences ,' as the explicit of the main text (end of book I) calls it 153 -which is to say, additions to the third redaction. Rather, as the explicit of the Additiones themselves states, they are additions to the 'lecture' that Durand 'copied and composed in Paris.'\n\n151. J. K och , Durandus ,  pp.  44-49. Cf. N icolaus M edensis (D urandellus ), Evidentiae contra Durandum , ed. P .T . S tella , Tübingen 2003, vol. 1, p. 56 (NB: W. D uba , 'Aristotle in Hell and Aquinas in Heaven: Hugo de Novocastro, OFM and Durandus de Aureliaco OP ,' in: Bulletin de Philosophie Médiévale 56 [2014], pp. 183-194, has recently proposed to re-identify re-identify Durandellus with Durand of Aurillac).\n\n153.

See p. 47 the criterion used by Koch: redaction C contains questions taken from the Quodlibet held by Durand in Avignon in 1314: I Sent. C, d. 17 q. 1 = Quodl. Aven . I q. 6; d. 33 q. 1 = in part Quodl. Aven. I q. 1. These two questions are present in the first part or main text of BnF Lat. 15364. Therefore, this text offers right away redaction C, and the Additiones are not additions to an earlier version. Moreover, the preface of the main text mentions Durand's presence in Avignon as a past fact.\n\n## Here is the full passage:\n\n/91ra/ Expliciunt tituli 61 correctorii qui sunt additiones et declarationes Magistri Durandi ordinis predicatorum doctoris venerabilis, quos super lecturam suam Sententiarum addidit quam Parisius copiavit et compilavit. Unde 100 et 9 et 61 faciunt 170, et tot sunt questiones summatim primi Durandi. Unde primus Durandi habet centum et septuaginta questiones.\n\nNonetheless, it is correct that the main text, to which the Additiones are appended, o ff ers the text of redaction C, minus the said additions. All in all, the total content of the manuscript looks to be that of redaction C, once the additions are inserted in their de fi nitive place. Why, then, are we told that the Additiones are additions to an earlier version? It is as if the content of redaction C of book I had been broken down: fi rst the questions that have a match in the questions that Durand had discussed  in  Paris,  then  the  questions  that  have  on  the  contrary  no match, and therefore are additional questions compared to the Parisian lectures. In other words, the layout dismembers redaction C and distinguishes what corresponds, at least formally, to the Paris lectures, and what is only in redaction C. When one of the questions has its equivalent in the Paris lectures, the main text gives the redaction C version of that question; when one of them has not been discussed in Paris, the main text refers to the Additiones , saying that one will fi nd below the text of that question (in its C version too). 154\n\nLet us see what this system reveals about distinction 17. At the end of the main text of book I (f. 65va-66va), one fi nds the complete list of the questions contained in redaction C, which is repeated at the beginning of the Additiones (f. 67ra-vb). I transcribe in italics the titles of the questions of dist. 17 that are present in the fi rst part or main text of the manuscript (f. 28vb to 31ra), that is to say, the topics that had been discussed in the Parisian lectures. I transcribe in normal font the ques-\n\n154. It is worth noting that the manuscript is rather carefully written and amended, once belonged to the College of Sorbonne, and has traces of the pecia system. Its peculiar composition must have served a purpose. Perhaps the Additiones were first a self-standing compendium of the questions that were in redaction C but not in the Paris lectures, and were available in other manuscripts; then, someone who wanted to have the full text of redaction C had the other questions of redaction C copied and placed first, with references to the already existing Additiones as a complement .\n\ntions contained in the Additiones , that is to say, the questions that are additional in the third version by comparison with the Paris lectures.\n\n## &lt;1&gt; Utrum necessarium sit caritatem esse habitum creatum in homine ad hoc quod homo sit Deo carus\n\n- &lt;2&gt; Utrum necessarium sit ponere caritatem habitualem ad hoc ut possumus aliquid mereri apud Deum &lt;cf. f. 29ra: Quere infra istam questionem  = Add. f. 80ra-80va&gt;\n- &lt;3&gt; Utrum caritas detur secundum proportionem naturalium\n- &lt;4&gt; Utrum ille qui est in caritate possit cognoscere certitudinaliter se habere caritatem &lt;= Add. f. 80va-vb&gt;. 155\n- &lt;5&gt; Utrum caritas possit augeri 156\n- &lt;6&gt; Que sit causa suscipiendi magis et minus &lt;cf. f. 30rb: Ista questio patet infra = Add. f. 80vb-81rb&gt;\n- &lt;7&gt; Utrum eadem forma numero possit esse intensa et remissa sive suscipere magis et minus &lt; cf. f.30rb: Ista questio aliter patet infra = Add. f. 81rb-82rb&gt;\n- &lt;8&gt; Utrum caritas augeatur per quemlibet actum &lt;cf. f.30rb: Ista etiam invenies infra = Add. f. 82rb-82va&gt;\n- &lt;9&gt; Utrum possit augeri in in fi nitum &lt;cf. f.30rb: Istam cum aliis tribus invenies infra secundum ordinem scriptas = Add. 82va-82vb&gt; &lt;10&gt; Utrum caritas possit diminui .\n\nTh ese ten questions are indeed present in redaction C as we know it from other manuscripts and the printed editions. Let us subtract the questions in normal font. Th is leaves four questions (in italics), which are therefore, according to the explicit of the Additiones , the only ones that  Durand discussed in Paris. Th ese  are  exactly  the  four  questions that are found in all the non-C manuscripts of book I. Th erefore, the non-C manuscripts give us a text that is at least structurally identical to the version that Durand had reworked in Paris, i.e. redaction B. Might\n\n155. The reference to the Additiones is missing in the main text.\n\n156. This question is in fact absent in the main text (and is not in the Additiones either). Its omission is easily explainable. This question is supposed to be the first of the second part of the distinction ('de caritatis augmento,' qq. 5-10). When finishing the first part of the distinction ('de necessitate caritatis,' qq. 1-4), the scribe jumped by homoeoteleuton to the 'Ad secundum' that introduces the second question of the second part, i.e. q. 6, f. 30rb.\n\nthey nevertheless transmit redaction A, in case Durand had not issued a  redaction  B  of  book  I,  as  Koch  believed?  No,  because  one  of  the non-C manuscripts indicates that two questions are missing in dist. 17, and this cannot be by comparison with redaction C, since there are six additional questions in redaction C, not two (see above, p. 327). Th erefore, it has to be by comparison with redaction A. Th us, redaction A was di ff erent from redaction B, since in redaction B dist. 17 has four questions, whereas in redaction A it comprised six questions (the four of redaction B plus the two reported as missing). Conclusion: the non-C manuscripts of book I contain redaction B. As a consequence, we do not have direct access to redaction A of book I.",
