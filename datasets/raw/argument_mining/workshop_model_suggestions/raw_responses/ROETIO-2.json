    "user_content": "## THE INFLUENCE OF FOREIGN KNOWLEDGE ON EIGHTEENTH CENTURY EUROPEAN SECULARISM\n\n## Heiner Roetz\n\nSecularism in  the  title  of  this  paper  does  not  refer  to  the  negative  antireligious ideology as which it is normally understood. Instead, I will use the term in its original meaning as a positive plea for a society free from the constraints of a religious doctrine. It had its roots in the epoch of the European Enlightenment with its peak in the eighteenth century but with a longer prehistory on which I will also focus.\n\nBy foreign knowledge I  mean first of all knowledge about and from the world  outside  of  the  Judeo-Christian  and  Greek  cultural  sphere,  which poured into Europe in the course of its colonial expansion from around 1500.  But  I  will  also  mention  earlier  impacts  from  the  Arab  world  inasmuch as they were of relevance to the topic that is at the centre of this volume:  secular  thought.  My  special  focus  will  be  on  the  role  of  China, which  exerted  a  tremendous  influence  on  Europe  in  this  epoch.  What happened  in  Europe  was  the  product  of  a  global  encounter  that  represents  the  trans-cultural  rather  than  the  specifically  European  nature  of the Enlightenment movement itself. It was the outcome of a confluence of  ideas  that  for  concrete  historical  reasons  fell  on  fertile  ground  in  this part  of  the  world.  But  it  took  its  ingredients  and  inspirations  also  from many other parts.\n\nThe  European  Enlightenment  is  as  much  a  product  of  European  history as it  is  an  expression  of  an  inter-  and  trans-cultural  dynamics.  This also applies to the secularist tendency of the age which is not a European invention  only  later  to  be  exported  to  other  cultures.  I  would  like  to emphasize  this  point  in  particular  against  Charles  Taylor's  voluminous analysis of the 'Secular Age' which in all its learnedness is a formidable document of North-Atlantic parochialism. It dwells on the topic on nearly a thousand pages, without even once mentioning the influences of nonEuropean cultures with partly much longer secular traditions, influences which are readily noticeable when one reads the relevant Western sources themselves.$^{1}  But  many  of  respective  authors  like  Vossius,  Bayle,  Wolff\n\n$^{1} For a critique of Taylor from a trans-cultural perspective cf. also Holenstein, 'Chinaeine altsäkulare Zivilisation.'\n\n© Heiner Roetz, 2013 | doi:10.1163/9789004251335\\_003\n\nThis is an open access chapter distributed under the terms of the CC BY-NC 4.0 license.\n\nand others are absent from Taylor's book. presumably, there is a strategy behind  this  neglect:  To  trump  secular  thought  by  making  it  part  of  the christian culture itself.\n\nlikewise,  no  mention  is  made  of  a  nineteenth  century  english  freethinker  who  deserves  a  place  in  a  history  of  european  secular  thought: george holyoake (1817-1906), who to my knowledge coined the term secularism ,  which is not from the eighteenth century itself. holyoake defines secularism as follows:\n\nSecularism relates to the present existence of man, and to action, the issues of which can be tested by the experience of this life. Its object is the development of the physical, moral, and intellectual nature of man to the highest perceivable point, as the immediate duty of society. Secularism accepts no authority but that of nature, adopts no methods but those of science and philosophy, and respects in practice no rule but that of the conscience, illustrated by the common sense of mankind. It values the lessons of the past and looks to tradition as presenting a storehouse of materials for thought, and in many cases results of high wisdom for reverence; but it utterly disowns tradition  as  a  ground  of  belief,  whether  miracles  and  supernaturalism  be claimed or not claimed on its side. no sacred scripture can be made a basis of  belief,  for  the  obvious  reason  that  its  claim  always  needs  to  be  proven. Individual members yield whatever respect their own good sense judges to be due to the opinions of great men, living or dead, spoken or written, as also to the practice of ancient communities, national or ecclesiastical. But they disown all appeal to such authorities as final tests of truth.$^{2}\n\nfrom the beginning the freethinker holyoake avoids a pitfall frequently encountered  in  the  discussion  of  secularism:  namely  that  secularism involves  the  disappearance  of  religion  and  the  imposition  of  a  secular ideology, and that, correspondingly, a secular society is unacceptable to religious  believers.  although  holyoake  was  an  atheist  himself-he  was actually the last englishman to go to prison for denying the existence of god-his secularist project is not primarily a program of fighting religion, nor a program of fighting tradition. It is rather a struggle for a system of rights$^{3}  that would allow the free expression of all, not only religious, but\n\n$^{2} There  are  different  versions  of  this  programmatic  description  of  secularism  in  publications  by  and  on  holyoake.  This  one  is  taken  from  fred  lee's  thesis Secularism  from the  Victorian  age  to  the  Twenty-first  century:  The  History  of  the  Leicester  Secular  Society , as quoted on the homepage of the leicester Secular Society, http://www.leicestersecular society.org.uk/holyoake.htm.\n\n$^{3} cf.  holyoake, The  Principles  of  Secularism ,  40:  'Secularism,  we  have  said,  concerns itself with four rights: 1. The right to Think for one's self, which most christians now admit, at least in theory. 2. The right to differ, without which the right to think is nothing worth.\n\nalso  non-religious  opinions.  Its  institutional  counterpart  is  nothing  but a  religiously  neutral  democracy  built  on  a  free  and  open  public  debate no longer substituting authority for argument-the only authority that it acknowledges being that of 'nature,' which in this context is just another word for common sense. a society is a secular society if it is institutionally based  on  this  kind  of  decision  finding  rather  than  allowing  unprovable contents  of  belief  'belonging  to  the  debatable  ground  of  speculation'$^{4} determine its general orientation. Its members, this is at least holyoake's hope, refrain from insisting on these beliefs as final instances of a truth for all. religion is not dismissed from society, but it no longer determines the basic structure of the state.\n\nwhat is remarkable within the context of my paper is that holyoake defends his secularist project by referring to none other than the ancient chinese philosopher confucius and the latter's reluctance to speak about religious matters and his aversion to proclaim truths that everybody has to follow. as holyoake says:\n\nfor  believing  less  where  others  believe  more,  for  expressing  decision  of opinion  which  the  reader  may  resent,  I  do  but  follow  in  the  footsteps  of confucius,  who,  as  stated  by  allen  upward,  'declared  that  a  principle of belief or even a rule of morality binding on himself need not bind a disciple whose own conscience did not enjoin it on him.' confucius, says his expositor,  thus  'reached  a  height  to  which  mankind  have  hardly  yet  lifted their eyes, and announced a freedom compared with which ours is an empty name.'$^{5}\n\nallen upward (1863-1926) was a British intellectual and poet who among other  things  published  a  selection  of  the  confucian Analects ( Lunyu , confucius' 'collected Sayings') based on James legge's translation.$^{6}  his description  of  confucius  quoted  by  holyoake  most  probably  refers  to passages  where  confucius  encourages  criticism  of  himself  by  his  disciples and shows himself happy when others detect his mistakes.$^{7} upward\n\n3. The right to assert difference of opinion, without which the right to differ is of no practical  use.  4.  The  right  to  debate  all  vital  opinion,  without  which  there  is  no  intellectual equality-no defence against the errors of the state or the pulpit.'\n\n$^{4} holyoake, English Secularism , 37.\n\n$^{5} holyoake, Bygones , 279.\n\n$^{6} The  edition  available  to  me  appeared  in  1905  under  the  title Sayings  of  K'ong  the Master . There was probably an earlier one quoted by holyoake.\n\n$^{7} In  his  selection,  upwards  quotes  analects  11.4  ('yan  hui  gives  me  no  help.  There is  nothing  that  I  say  in  which  he  does  not  delight.')  and  7.31  ('I  am  fortunate!  If  I  have any errors people are sure to know them.') in Sayings, 23 and 41, after legge, Confucian Analects .\n\nattributes this  decent  attitude  to  confucius'  renunciation  of  taking recourse  to  a  supernatural  truth,  and  the  corresponding  accent  on  this life rather than on death, on this world rather than a realm beyond, as in the famous passage from the Analects :\n\nJi  lu  asked  about  serving  the  spirits.  The  master  said,  'while  you  are  not able to serve men, how can you serve spirits?' Ji lu added, 'I venture to ask about death.' he was answered, 'while you do not know life, how can you know about death?'$^{8}\n\n## upward concludes:\n\nIs is on this plane that his morality is established. making no claim to knowledge of the future life, it followed that he did not pretend to train men for it, but contented himself with the humbler task of teaching them how to live on earth. mean and insufficient as such an aim may seem to those who have been vouchsafed a clear and certain revelation from the Beyond, it entitled the master to a lofty rank among creatures of mortal birth.$^{9}\n\nThis  assessment  of  confucius  understandably  aroused  holyoake's  sympathy.  confucius  is  today  still  a  hero  of  the  British  humanists,  the  successors of his secularist movement.$^{1}$^{0}  he  is  certainly  not  holyoake's  first source of inspiration, which is the freethought of the enlightenment. But the  enlightenment  thinkers  whom  holyoake  mentions  among  his  predecessors,  like  matthew  Tindal  and  Voltaire,  have  themselves  confessed their enthusiasm for confucius. The secularist holyoake's deep bow to the chinese sage seems to be more than just than a casual compliment.\n\nThis  takes  us  from  the  nineteenth  to  the  eighteenth  century  and  the time  before  that.  not  only  by  his  espousal  of  confucian  ideals,  but  by nearly  all  of  his  central  topoi  like  the  authority  of  nature,  the  emphasis on common sense, and his anti-ecclesiasticism holyoake is a late child of the european enlightenment.\n\nThe  enlightenment  is  not  simply  a  late  branch  of  the  great  tree  of european cultural tradition that could be sufficiently explained by writing an internal history of the west. on the one hand, it was tantamount to a radical critique of this tradition, and on the other hand, it is characterized by a hitherto unknown interest in what has never been part of or come into close contact with it-the foreign. Both these aspects, calling\n\n$^{8} analects 11.12; upward, Sayings , 19-20.\n\n$^{9} upward, Sayings , 8.\n\n$^{1}$^{0} cf.  for  example  the  homepage  of  the  British  humanist  association,  http://www .humanism.org.uk/humanism, entrance 'confucius', and Knight, Humanist Anthology .\n\ninto  question one's own heritage and opening one's eyes to the foreign, are two sides of the same coin. genetically as well as systematically, the enlightenment is best understood as an intercultural phenomenon.$^{1}$^{1}\n\nThe  enlightenment  is  preceded  by  an  unparalleled  extension  of  the european  horizon  during  the  renaissance,  when  in  a  transition  'from the  closed  world  to  the  infinite  universe,'  as  alexandre  Koyré  put  it  in the  title  of  his  famous  book,$^{1}$^{2}  the  fixed  hierarchies  of  the  theocentric medieval  ordo  are  caused  to  collapse.  The  renaissance  is  the  era  in which all attributes of the medieval transcendent god-infinity, creativity, all, everything-are transferred to the creation itself which begins to 'outglow'$^{1}$^{3}  the  creator.  It  is  the  age  of  discovery  and  thus  the  disintegration  of  the  geographic  framework  of  the  biblical  landscape.  It  is  the age  of  astronomy  which  likewise  unbalances  the  centre  of  the  hitherto known world. It is the age of the reformation which opens the inner part of humans for an ardent search beyond known borders, often paired with cosmic speculation. It is the age of mystical pan-isms in the name of the unomnia (patrizzi,  1519-97),$^{1}$^{4}  the  all-in-one:  pantheism  (god  in  everything),  panentheism  (everything  in  god),  panpsychism  (holism  of  mind and matter), and pansophia (encyclopedic collection of all knowledge) or cosmosophia. The renaissance is also the age of enhanced individuality, and both, the all-in-one and the specific, are integrated in the model of the dynamic monad. 'The monads,' says giordano Bruno, 'are, each in its own form, the divinity itself '.$^{1}$^{5} The smallest and the greatest part of the cosmos  are  related  to  each  other,  micro-  and  macrocosm  are  mutually mirroring, the study of the cosmic nature is the study of humans and vice versa. god and nature are onedeus sive natura .$^{1}$^{6}  'The face of the whole universe,'  says  Spinoza,  'however  it  varies  in  infinitely  many  modes,  is always the same ( semper eadem ).'$^{1}$^{7}\n\nThis prepares the mental ground to transcend the limits of the christian world:  positively  via  the  new unomnia ,  which  makes  the  world  wider and nearer at the same time, and negatively through the weariness with\n\n$^{1}$^{1}  cf.  for  the following roetz, Mensch und Natur , §1, Israel, Radical Enlightenment , and Israel, Enlightenment contested . cf. also lee eun-jung, Anti-Europa .\n\n$^{1}$^{2} Koyré, From the Closed World to the Infinite Universe .\n\n$^{1}$^{3} Bloch, Vorlesungen zur Philosophie der Renaissance , 15 ('die Schöpfung gilt mehr als der Schöpfer, sie überleuchtet den Schöpfer im Begriff.').\n\n$^{1}$^{4} Bloch, Renaissance , 17.\n\n$^{1}$^{5} Bruno, Monas .\n\n$^{1}$^{6} Spinoza, Ethics , 190, part 4, preface.\n\n$^{1}$^{7} wolf, Correspondence of Spinoza , letter 64, Spinoza to Schuller, 308.\n\necclesiastical dogmatism that led to the 'bloody barbarism' (Voltaire) of the  religious  wars.  allies  are  found  beyond  the  borders  of  the  biblicalchristian  culture,  first  and  foremost  in  the  Stoic  philosophy  of  pagan european antiquity.\n\nThe  Stoics,  leaving  behind  the  comparatively  provincial  thought  of plato  and  aristotle,  had  promulgated  the  notion  of  the tou cosmou politai ,  the  cosmopolitan. It was based on the ontological assumption of an all-encompassing  normative  order  overruling  the  differences  between cultures and representing a nomos agraphos ,  an  unwritten law of nature valid  for  everyone.  The  epistemological  counterpart  of  this  normative ontology was the conviction that all human beings, because of the nature of human thought, produce koinai ennoiai , in latin translation notiones communes -common ideas, later to become the common sense. These ensure the consensus gentium , the unanimity of all human beings and peoples in essential matters.\n\nThe Stoic line of thinking merges with another current that Bloch has called  'left  aristotelianism'  and  which  influenced  all  heterodox  movements  of  the  late  middle  ages-the  arab  cleansing  of  aristotelian  philosophy from platonic detritus. This was the work, among others, of Ibn Sina (avicenna, 980-1037) and above all Ibn roshd (averroes, 1126-1198), who  abolished  the  platonic  separation  of morphe and hyle ,  form  und stuff  that  had  been  the  philosophical  basis  of  the  hierarchization  of  the medieval world. In the following, the natura naturata , the created nature, becomes the natura naturans , the creating nature itself. Bruno's notion of the monad is deeply influenced by this tendency.\n\nno  less  important  was  the  arab  pioneering  of  tolerance  connected to  these  ontological,  principally  egalitarian  shifts.  It  possibly  influenced nikolaus cusanus and certainly Jean Bodin.$^{1}$^{8} In the religious wars of the sixteenth century, Bodin (a contradictory figure also jointly responsible for the witch craze) becomes the theoretician of a trans-confessional political absolutism. In his Colloquium Heptaplomeres of 1593, which was later put on the Index, he lets coronaeus, a catholic, Salomo, a Jew, fridericus, a lutheran,  curtius,  a  calvinist,  octavius,  a  moslem,  Senamus,  a  Sceptic, and  Toralba,  a  naturalist,  debate  about  religion.$^{1}$^{9}  Toralba  attacks  the positive religions: dogmas, he says, are superfluous, and the moslems and\n\n$^{1}$^{8} cf.  griffel,  'Toleranzkonzepte  im  Islam,'  Bobzin,  'Islamkundliche  Quellen  in  Jean Bodins heptaplomeres,' and forst, Toleranz im Konflikt , 116-120 (averroes). $^{1}$^{9} Bodin, Colloquium of the Seven . cf. frost, Toleranz im Konflikt , 191-200.\n\nJews are closer to the true religion than the christians. The true religion is the natural religion that god has implanted in every human being.\n\nNatural religion ,  in  the  name  of  which  the  demand  for  tolerance  was raised,  becomes  one  of  the  central  combat  terms  of  the  enlightenment. Natural means  based  on  general  human  reason  rather  than  revelation, in  accordance  with  the  Stoic  cosmology.  a  natural  religion,  therefore, must be found everywhere, outside the christian realm as well. It was via this  road  that  the  decisive  attacks  against  the  claim  for  exclusiveness  of christianity were carried forward for more than a century, beginning with edward herbert of cherbury (1581-1648).\n\nThus the theoretical framework was laid for a serious and systematic interest in the foreign, and it was filled with and corroborated by material from asia, in particular from china.\n\nThe  one  hundred  years  before  the  french  revolution  were  a  time  of a  rampant  Sinophilia  in  many  domains  of  european  life-architecture, arts and crafts, literature and, last but not least, philosophy. confucius in particular enjoyed extraordinary popularity. as lionel Jensen writes, confucius was a significant, and salient, artifact. The frequency with which his  name  and  image  appeared  in  letters,  memoirs,  treatises,  travel  literature, and histories suggests that he was moved like new world specie in an expanding  market  of  new  ideas  joining  rome  with  paris,  london,  Berlin, prague  and  then,  in  turn,  with  the  missionary  outposts  at  goa,  canton, macao, and Beijing.$^{2}$^{0}\n\nThe  first  engraving  of  an  ideal  portrait  of  confucius  was  'plagiarized by  countless  works  of  the  late  seventeenth  and  the  early  eighteenth century'.$^{2}$^{1}  The historical background of this chinoiserie was not just the christian missionary project but a global economic market where all kinds of  commodities were traded all over the world, with china as one of its main hubs.\n\nwhat  was  the  interest  which  the  european  enlightenment  took  in china,  and  what  was  the  basis  for  it?  The  fascination  emanating  from china was first of all due to the impression that it was an 'anti-europe,' as leibniz says, in the sense of a 'civilized world' that did not share some important characteristics with europe, above all with regard to revealed religion, and had perhaps not brought forth so many sciences, but were on a level with europe on the decisive questions of morality. This world at the\n\n$^{2}$^{0} Jensen, Manufacturing Confucianism , 9.\n\n$^{2}$^{1}  rule, K'ung-tzu or Confucius , 73.\n\nother end of eurasia, both alien and yet familiar at the same time, made possible 'a commercium not only of commodities and manufactures, but also of light and wisdom'.$^{2}$^{2} china, which had been ruled by the manchu dynasty  since  1644,  was  regarded  as  the  'wisest  empire  of  the  world'$^{2}$^{3} and an exemplary case of an enlightened monarchy, the highest political ideal of most european intellectuals before the french revolution. unlike europe,  china  appeared  to  be  free  from  religious  oppression.  while louis XIV had abolished the tolerance edict of nantes in 1685, the Qing emperor Kangxi had afforded the Jesuit mission freedom to preach.\n\nchina had become known in the west above all through the reports of the christian missionaries, mainly the Jesuits, and their translations of central confucian writings that appeared from the end of the seventeenth century.  The  accommodative  missionary  practice  of  the  Jesuits  corresponded to the positive picture of china that they spread in europe. Jesuit accommodation was justified by the argument that confucianism, unlike Buddhism, was not a religion and thus did not collide with christianity, and yet  was  sufficiently  religiously  tuned  to  enter  into  a  liaison  with  it. The dominicans and franciscans, but also some Jesuits themselves, criticized this view and pleaded for a harder line. They spread the suspicion that  what  in  fact  was  raging  in  china  was  atheism.  The  dispute  finally ended in the 'rites controversy,' which resulted in the closure of the Jesuit mission.\n\nIt was this constellation that electrified critically minded european philosophers searching for alternatives beyond the religious fanaticism that was tearing europe apart. one of the first was pierre Bayle (1647-1706), who picked up the quarrel within the christian mission in his Dictionnaire historique et critique .  he refers to the opponents of the Jesuits and to the Jesuit  minority  opinion  that  'most  of  these  scholars  are  simply  denying the  existence  of  god'.  The  same  Jesuit  'bigots  for  faith,'  he  says,  report 'that these scholars believe in nothing spiritual and think that the 'King on high'$^{2}$^{4} which your matteo ricci has taken to be the true god is in reality nothing but the materialist heaven'. 'and confucius,' says Bayle, quoting longobardi, ricci's successor as head of the Jesuit mission in Beijing, 'said  some  nice  things  with  regard  to  morality  and  the  art  of  rulership, but as far as the true god is concerned he was just as blind as all of the\n\n$^{2}$^{2} leibniz, 'leibnizcus denkschrift,' 81.\n\n$^{2}$^{3} Voltaire, Essai sur les mœurs I, Œuvres 11, 180.\n\n$^{2}$^{4} Shang  di,  the  name  of  the  high  god  of  the  Shang  dynasty  (17th-11th  century  B.c.), one of the candidates for the translation of god into chinese.\n\nothers.'$^{2}$^{5} Bayle does not quote these voices in order to join the anti-confucian  camp  but  in  order  to  strategically  launch  the  conceivability  of  a society of atheists. If atheism became a realistic option, it was due to the backing that it received from the east.\n\nleibniz, in accordance with his monadology which assumes that in all parts of the universe the traces of the divine perfection must be found, is driven by an ecumenical interest similar to that of the religiously sceptical  enlightenment.  But  he  seeks  to  win  back  china  for  religion  and  to prove the complete accord of confucian philosophy with the principles not only of a natural religion but also of a natural theology, though without  a  full-fledged  revelation.$^{2}$^{6}  This  is  one  of  the  attempts  to  keep  the new information from the east compatible with the biblical tradition, in order to forestall the denigration of the latter to a phenomenon of historical and local value only. for the same reason, the Jesuits Joachim Bouvet (1656-1730),  with  whom  leibniz  corresponded,  und  Jacques  foucquet (1665-1741)  invented  a  bizarre  figurist  hermeneutics  which  detected  the enciphered figurations of revelation in chinese characters and texts.$^{2}$^{7}\n\nSimilarly, an answer was sought to the chinese challenge to the mosaic chronology. In a fragment of his Pensées (ed.  1670)  entitled  'histoire  de la  chine,' Blaise pascal (1623-1662) asks: 'which is the more credible of the two, moses or china?'$^{2}$^{8} pascal asks this question within the context of  his  polemic  apology  for  christianity.  It  is  triggered  by  the  shaking  of the  foundations  of  the  biblical  worldview  due  to  the  new  accounts  of chinese history. The debate was advanced, among others, by the dutch scholar  Isaac  Vossius  (1618-1689),  an  influential  china  enthusiast  about whom King charles II of england reportedly said, 'he believes everything except what is in the Bible.'$^{2}$^{9} It was a general assumption based on the book of Genesis and thus its presumed author moses that the world had been created in about 4.000 B.c. or, to be more precise, that creation was completed on the twenty-third of october in the year 4.004 B.c. at 8 a.m. This was no longer tenable, if the chinese dating for the periods of reign of  their  early  emperors and cultural heroes was true. In fact, this dating was based on numerological speculations of later times.$^{3}$^{0} In seventeenth\n\n$^{2}$^{5} Bayle, Dictionnaire , vol. 3, entrance 'maldonat,' 296.\n\n$^{2}$^{6} See his Novissima Sinica and his Discourse on the Natural Theology of the Chinese .\n\n$^{2}$^{7} cf.  von collani, Die Figuristen .\n\n$^{2}$^{8} pascal, Pensées , fragment 592.\n\n$^{2}$^{9} weststeijn, 'Spinoza sinicus,' 541.\n\n$^{3}$^{0} even  the  historicity  of  the  respective  rulers  is  uncertain-it  cannot  be  proven because of the absence of writing.\n\ncentury europe, however, it sufficed to shatter an even more questionable chronology (although the hermeneutical means to alleviate the problem had  been  at  hand  since  late  antiquity),  with  far  reaching  consequences to the effect of historicizing the Bible. There is a premonition in pascal's question  that  the  debate  on  chronology  was  only  the  beginning,  with china being the catalyser, of a development at the end of which Biblicalchristian teaching would not only lose control over the computation of time but also its monopoly of interpreting the world.\n\nI  cannot give a full account here of the arguments that the enlightenment discussed with regard to the east. I will instead focus on four topics which, as I see it, were of special importance to fostering the secular tendencies of the time in terms of a gradual detachment from the christian world-view  and  religious  forms  of  legitimation.  These  are  the  topics  of naturalism,  rationalism,  autonomy  and  secularity  itself.  There  are  many stakeholders  in  the  debate,  among  them  prominent  figures  like  pierre Bayle,  françois  Quesnay,  Voltaire  and  the  historian  nicolas  fréret  in france, matthew Tindal and david hume in england and Scotland, and leibniz and christian wolff in germany. one of the most dramatic events in the philosophical scene of the eighteenth century is closely connected to this debate-wolff 's expulsion from prussia under threat of the death penalty after his provocative lecture of 1721 on the 'practical philosophy of the chinese,' the Oratio de Sinarum philosophia practica , at the university of halle.\n\n1. Naturalism .  going  beyond  the  distinctness  of  specific  traditions,  the enlightenment  thinkers  assume  a  fundamental  oneness  of  all  mankind grounded in the oneness of nature. 'all that differs  between men,' says Voltaire, possibly paraphrasing an almost identical statement by confucius, 'depends on habits,' while 'all what is based on human nature is similar to each other from the one end of the world to the other.'$^{3}$^{1} 'The rule of habit,' he adds, 'refers to customs and practices, and it brings variation on to the stage of the world. But nature effects unity.'$^{3}$^{2}\n\nNature is the buzz word of the eighteenth century, alongside cosmopolitan , and both are internally connected to each other. In the philosophical discourse of the enlightenment, which overlaps with the china discourse,\n\n$^{3}$^{1} Voltaire, Essai  sur  les  mœurs , Œuvres 13,  182.  cf.  confucius  in Lunyu 17.2:  '[human beings] by nature are close to each other. By daily practice (or: by custom) they diverge from one another.'\n\n$^{3}$^{2} Voltaire, Essai sur les mœurs, Œuvres 13, 182.\n\nnature  is  the  all-encompassing  normatively  laden  unity  of  macro-  and microcosm where everything mirrors everything. This is the Stoic understanding of nature (as distinct from the developing outlook of the natural sciences)  that  the lumières rediscover  in  china.  The  enlightenment  sets nature against history, where, according to the christian belief, the teleological process of salvation ( Heilsgeschichte ) takes place. with few exceptions, the philosophers cherish the beginning as the original and perfect, while history is the history of betrayal, above all by the priests. There is no truth in it; 'it is,' says Voltaire, 'in the end nothing more than a tableau of  crimes  and  misfortunes.'$^{3}$^{3}  progress  in  the  understanding  of  the  prerevolutionary eighteenth century is the refinement of something already given,  the  unfolding  of  primordiality  and  the  perfection  of  naturalness rather  than  a  movement  forward  towards  something  completely  novel. This  made  chinese  civilization,  which  according  to  its  self-presentation had  been  preserved  'without  noticeable  change'$^{3}$^{4}  for  several  thousand years and directly linked to its early origins, the foremost witness of the natural. 'There is no other people,' says wolff, 'that has preserved the natural power so entirely as the chinese.' They 'only used their natural powers  and  did  not  receive  anything  by  contacts  with  other  peoples.'$^{3}$^{5}  for françois  Quesnay  (1694-1774),  the  intellectual  leader  of  the  physiocrats and according to mirabeau 'le confucius de l'europe,' the 'political and moral constitution of this great empire' is an authentic representation of the 'natural law,' the foundation of any positive law.$^{3}$^{6} The extraordinary esteem for confucius himself, too, must be seen in this context. The fact that  confucius  called  himself  a  'transmitter  rather  than  an  innovator'$^{3}$^{7} does  not  make  him  a  stolid  traditionalist  in  the  eyes  of  the  eighteenth century, but the herald of a primordial truth unadulterated by time and thus an authority of the first rank. china, represented by the teachings of confucius, illustrates 'how capable nature is'.$^{3}$^{8}\n\n2. Rationalism . Nature and reason are  corresponding,  if  not  identical terms for the enlightenment. reason is the lumen naturale standing above written  law.  and  what  is  reasonable  nature  at  large  is  natural  reason within  the  human  being.  again  china  delivers  the  paradigm  case.  'The\n\n$^{3}$^{3} Voltaire, L'Ingénu ,  37:  'en  effet,  l'histoire  n'est  que  le  tableau  des  crimes  et  des malheurs.'\n\n$^{3}$^{4} Voltaire, Œuvres 11, 165 .\n\n$^{3}$^{5} wolff, Rede , 171 note 83.\n\n$^{3}$^{6} Quesnay, Le Despotisme de la Chine , 636.\n\n$^{3}$^{7} Lunyu , 7.1.\n\n$^{3}$^{8} wolff, Rede , 171 note 83.\n\nchief principle he seems to lay down for a foundation, and builds upon,' the  english  statesman  william  Temple  (1628-1699)  says  of  confucius, 'is that every man ought to study and endeavour the improving and perfection of his own natural reason to the greatest height he is capable, so that he may never (or as seldom as he can) err and deviate from the law of nature in the course and conduct of his life.'$^{3}$^{9} and wolff writes:\n\nThe chinese have never ordered any human actions and never spoken of any exercise in the virtues and customs than what according to their insight corresponded with human reason. It comes as no surprise, therefore, that all of their undertakings went so well, since they did nothing than that which was seen as grounded in nature.$^{4}$^{0}\n\nVoltaire, again, praises confucius in a poem put under an engraving with a portrait of the chinese sage:\n\nThe salutary interpreter of the one and only reason, illuminating the minds without dazzling them, he only spoke as a sage and never as a prophet, and so they believed him even in his own country.$^{4}$^{1}\n\nVoltaire also lauds the reasonableness of the literature of the chinese:\n\nThe chinese do not have any history prior to the history of their emperors. They have hardly any invented myths, not a single miracle and no inspired men who called themselves half gods like among the egyptians and greeks. ever since this people began to write, it has written reasonably.$^{4}$^{2}\n\n3. Autonomy .  The  fact  that  the  voice  speaking  through  confucius  is  the voice  of  nature  does  not,  in  the  eyes  of  his  followers  of  the  eighteenth century,  as  distinct  from  hegel's  later  view,$^{4}$^{3}  lead  to  an  ethics  adapted to the given world and subsuming the individual under a greater whole. It  is  just  the  opposite  point  that  they  make:  The  fact  that  the  natural human being is the moral human being endows man with an autonomous\n\n$^{3}$^{9} Quoted in Israel, Enlightenment Contested , 641f.\n\n$^{4}$^{0} wolff, Rede , 103f.\n\n$^{4}$^{1}  Voltaire, Dictionnaire philosophique II, Œuvres 18,  151.

The  author  of  a  letter  published 1786 in l'Année littéraire commented: 'what poison is contained in this inscription!' (Voltaire, Œuvres 18, 151 note 1).\n\n$^{4}$^{2} Voltaire, Essai sur les mœurs, Œuvres 11, 61.\n\n$^{4}$^{3} cf. hegel, Enzyklopädie 397 (§ 502): 'Self-determination is the opposite of the determination by nature.'

I  have  already  quoted  his  sentence  that  'The  chinese  have never ordered any human actions and never spoken of any exercise in the virtues  and  customs  than  what  according  to  their  insight  corresponded exactly  with  human  reason.'  The  'foundation  of  the  natural  law,'  wolff argues with china as example, is 'that the free actions of man [. . .] should be  determined  by  those  general  reasons  to  which  the  natural  [actions] conform.'$^{4}$^{7} as he says,\n\n'The chinese insisted on reason, because one must have a clear perception of  good and evil if one wants to dedicate oneself to virtue without fear of one's superiors and without hope of being rewarded by them, but one will not achieve a perfect perception of good and evil unless one has examined exactly the nature and reasons of things.'-'It is because he who is moved into certain actions by fear of a superior or by hope of a reward [. . .] does not  do  voluntarily  what  corresponds  to  reason,  and  the  chinese  does  not count it as a virtue.'$^{4}$^{8}\n\none  does  not  need  a  guardian,  then,  in  order  to  know  the  difference between good and evil, because one knows it by one's own nature.\n\nwolff 's  intellectual  encounter  with  china  culminating  in  his Oratio coincides  with  his  work  on Deutsche  Ethik ( Ethics  in  German  language ) which  appeared  in  1720,  the  year  before  the  china  lecture  was  held. like all  of  wolff 's  writings,  it  had  a  tremendous  impact  on  the  german enlightenment. wolff 's description of the chinese philosophia practica in terms of freedom and self-determination corresponds to the formulation of the principle of autonomy in paragraph 24 of Deutsche Ethik :\n\n$^{4}$^{4} wolff, Rede , 146f, note 71.\n\n$^{4}$^{5} montesquieu, Spirit of the Laws vol. 1, 269.\n\n$^{4}$^{6} Voltaire, Essai sur les mœurs , Œuvres 11, 174, perhaps referring to Dadai Liji 48, 114.\n\n$^{4}$^{7} wolff, Rede , 175f, note 84.\n\n$^{4}$^{8} wolff, Rede , 211f and 237, note 142.\n\nBecause we see by reason what the law of nature wants to have, therefore a reasonable man does not need any further law, but by his reason he is a law unto himself.$^{4}$^{9}\n\nwolff insists that he has found his 'invention,' the formulation of the principle of autonomy on the basis of the unity of micro- and macrocosm 'by his own deliberation'.$^{5}$^{0} But he concedes to china not only the historical priority  in  discovering  this  principle  but  also  a  decisive  role  in  confirming  it.  This  means  that  confucius  would  also  have  indirectly  influenced Kant's secular ethics of autonomy, although Kant himself shared neither the naturalistic approach of reasoning of the Deutsche Ethik nor  wolff 's enthusiasm for china which is based on this approach.\n\nas a matter of fact, as I see it,  wolff  has  overemphasized the cosmological  foundation  of  confucius'  ethics  and  deemphasized  the  religious elements which still exist despite the secular tendencies.$^{5}$^{1}  nevertheless, wolff does not follow a merely 'orientalist' image of china. The result of his analysis can be defended despite problems in its derivation. he correctly identifies  in  confucian  ethics  inner  sources  of  an  autonomous  morality that later  interpreters,  allegedly  much better informed, have overlooked (see below).\n\n4. Secularism . I have pointed out already that secularism as a term only appears in  the  middle  of  the  nineteenth  century,  coined  by  the  english freethinker holyoake. But as far as its essence is concerned, the idea has its forerunners in the much older history of materialism and particularly in the enlightenment philosophy to which holyoake is indebted. The foremost enlightenment protagonists of secularism are Spinoza and Bayle.\n\nSpinoza  confounds  god  with  the  order  of  nature  and  conceives  of  a state in which human law as based on the law of nature should take priority  over  the  divine  law  propagated  by  the  positive  religions.  he  was excommunicated as a heretic by the Jewish community of amsterdam in 1656. Thereafter, Spinozism is frequently attacked or defended as the paradigm of materialism and, interestingly, identified as such with 'oriental philosophy' where 'all things are one'toutes choses sont un , highlighted as  an axiome chinois by  the  Jesuits  nicolas  longobardi  and  antoine  de\n\n$^{4}$^{9} wolff, Vernünfftige Gedancken , §24, 18f:  'Ja  weil  wir  durch  die  Vernunfft  erkennen, was das gesetze der natur haben will; so brauchet ein vernünfftiger mensch kein weiteres gesetze, sondern vermittelst seiner Vernunfft ist er ihm selbst ein gesetze.' $^{5}$^{0} wolff, Rede , 223f.\n\n$^{5}$^{1} for  a  critique, cf. larrimore, 'orientalism and antivoluntarism,' and louden, 'what does heaven Say?,' 73-93.\n\nSainte marie.$^{5}$^{2} In his Entretien d'un Philosophe chrétien et d'un Philosophe chinois ,  nicolas  malebranche  (1638-1715)  presents  the  chinese  philosopher as a defender of Spinozism, and, in response to Jesuit criticism of his book, also directly identifies the chinese with the 'impious Spinoza'.$^{5}$^{3} In the entry 'Japon' of his Dictionnaire ,  Bayle writes that what the Japanese teach is 'very similar to the philosophy of Spinoza'. 'It is quite certain,' he says, 'that [Spinoza] has taught together with these Japanese preachers that the first principle of all things and all beings that constitute the universe is nothing but one and the same substance.'$^{5}$^{4}\n\nThese are just two examples of a standard comparison to be found in the  european literature  from  the  seventeenth  century  to  hegel.$^{5}$^{5}  Is  the similarity only structural, or is there also a genetic dependency? Spinoza's sources  are  surely  to  be  found  in  the  Stoic  philosophy  of  nature,  and  it comes  as  no  surprise  that  the  comparison  between  Stoics  like  epiktet and Seneca on the one hand and confucius on the other is also typical of  the  cosmos  of  thought  of  the  enlightenment.$^{5}$^{6}  however,  is  has  been convincingly  argued  that  there  might  also  have  been  a  direct  stimulus on Spinoza from the east.$^{5}$^{7} Spinoza not only belonged to an intellectual network  that  included  the  china  fanatic  Isaac  Vossius,$^{5}$^{8}  whom  I  have already  mentioned.  There  was  also  the  publication  of  Bernhard  Varen's Descriptio regni Iaponiae (1649)  which,  in  an  addendum on 'chinensum religio,' reports that the chinese\n\n- [. . .] assert that the whole universe consists of one and the same substance and that its creator together with sky and earth, men and beasts, trees and plants, and finally the four elements$^{5}$^{9} compose a single continuous body, of whose great body individual creatures are members. from the unity of this substance they teach [. . .] that we can arrive at similitude to god from the fact that he is one with him.$^{6}$^{0}\n\nIf  this  did not directly influence Spinoza, the similarity with his philosophy is at least striking.\n\n$^{5}$^{2} Quoted in leibniz, Discours sur la théologie naturelle des Chinois , §§ 21, 57 and 64.\n\n$^{5}$^{3} malebranche, Entretien , 42.\n\n$^{5}$^{4} Bayle, Dictionnaire , vol. 2, 832, translation weststeijn, 'Spinoza sinicus,' 537.\n\n$^{5}$^{5} cf.

It  tells  of a  boy  who  grows  up  alone  on  an  island,  thus  without  religious  instruction,  and  who  yet  achieves  knowledge  of  himself  and  god.$^{6}$^{1}  The  translator,  Johannes  Bouwmeester,  states  that  he  was  'inspired  by  eastern philosophy'.$^{6}$^{2}\n\nas to pierre Bayle, I have already mentioned his argument that china proves the possibility of an admirable social order without the guidance of religion, because the chinese are atheists. leibniz opposes this view, but it  is  confirmed again by wolff. unlike leibniz, it is not wolff's intention to defend confucianism against the reproach of atheism, but to make use of this reproach and turn it against those who raised it. he stresses in the Oratio that the ancient chinese 'knew nothing of the creator of all things and had no natural service of god let alone traces of the divine revelation'. and so they could use 'no other forces than natural forces not based on any service of god in order to promote the exercise of virtue'.$^{6}$^{3} wolff 's naturalism  and  his  alliance  with  china  have  an  openly  atheistic  direction of assault, even if he later tactically modified some of his statements. The strategic  goal  is  unmistakable:  wolff  wants  to  replace  the  'external reasons' of religion which the chinese 'never have paid attention to' by the 'internal reasons derived from the nature of human action itself,' with china as the prime example 'how far those internal reasons can take us.'$^{6}$^{4} This is the decisive move of enlightenment secularism: There is no world beyond in which the human being would find his orientation. There is a direct line from here to the secular foundation of ethics in Kant. according to  charles  Taylor,  who  neither  mentions wolff nor his possible chinese inspirers, 'the discovery of the intra-human sources of benevolence is one of the great achievements of our (!) civilization and the charter of modern unbelief,' and, moreover, the decisive turning point to the 'secular age.'$^{6}$^{5} obviously,  the  enlightenment  cosmopolitans  had  a  broader  perspective on 'our civilization' than the modern canadian philosopher.\n\na  more  moderate  critique  of  religion  which,  nevertheless,  in  the  end likewise  amounts  to  its  subversion,  was  put  forward  by  deism.  deism pushes  god  out  of  the  world  to  its  very  beginning  where  he  initiates  a\n\n$^{6}$^{1}  for  a  modern translation, see goldmann, Ibn Tufayl's Hayy ibn Yaqzān .\n\n$^{6}$^{2} weststeijn, 'Spinoza sinicus,' 550.\n\n$^{6}$^{3} wolff, Rede , 112ff.\n\n$^{6}$^{4} wolff, Rede , 219f.\n\n$^{6}$^{5} Taylor, A Secular Age , 257.\n\nprocess which then follows its natural rules without further divine intervention  and  mysteries  and  fully  accessible  to  reason.  deism  leaves  the belief  in  and  even  the  veneration  of  a  higher  being  intact,  but  in  such vagueness that any formation of a positive religion can only be a wrong concretization  of  a  'religious  normal  truth'  ( religiöse  Normalwahrheit ).$^{6}$^{6} This  conception  not  only  corresponded  to  the  new  mechanistic  worldexplanations, but also to the growing aversion to the intolerance and the bloody quarrels among the confessions. deism in the eighteenth century was  partly  a  private  form  of  religiosity  and  partly  a  polite  and  socially acceptable form of atheism, especially prominent in Britain, but also in france. It drew its backing again from confucian china.\n\n'The  only  regular  body  of  deists  in  the  universe,'  says  david  hume, with the later consent of Kant, are the confucians.$^{6}$^{7} There is not a single one  of  the  British  deists  who  would  not  pay  tribute  to  confucius.  John Toland reckons confucius among the 'Votaries of Truth' along with the greek  philosophers,$^{6}$^{8}  charles  Blount  uses  Jesuit  travelogues  on  china to  decry  'particular  religions'  as  well  as  the  revealed  religion.  It  cannot be true, he says, because it is not known to all human beings.$^{6}$^{9} Thomas gordon expresses his wish that 'all fiery catholicks and bigots everywhere were converted into rational and sober chinese'.$^{7}$^{0} and matthew Tindal (1656-1733) assures in his book Christianity as Old as the Creation (a typically  deist  title):  'I  am  so  far  from  Thinking  the  maxims  of  confucius, and Jesus christ to differ; that I think the plain and simple maxims of the former, will help to illustrate the more obscure ones of the latter; accommodated to the then way of speaking.'$^{7}$^{1} Tindal also quotes the Spanish self-critical  missionary  navarrete,  who  says,  agreeing  with  leibniz,  'It  is god's special providence, that the chinese did not know what is done in christendome, for if they did, there would be never a man among them, but wou'd spit in our face.'$^{7}$^{2}\n\nThe deist Voltaire, as quoted above, praised the chinese for not knowing  miracles,  which  is  a  deist  topos.  he  lauded  confucius  in  his  poem as  'the  salutary  interpreter  of  the  one  and  only  reason,  illuminating  the minds without dazzling them'. In a variant of this poem that according\n\n$^{6}$^{6} Troeltsch, 'der deismus,' 430.\n\n$^{6}$^{7} hume, 'of superstition and enthusiasm,' 71.\n\n$^{6}$^{8} Toland, Pantheisticon , 64.\n\n$^{6}$^{9} cf.  mcdermott, Jonathan Edwards Confronts the Gods , 210.\n\n$^{7}$^{0} Quoted after Tarantino, 'le Symbole d'un laïque,' 426.\n\n$^{7}$^{1}  Tindal, Christianity as Old as the Creation , 342.\n\n$^{7}$^{2} Tindal, Christianity as Old as the Creation , 405.\n\n## heiner roetz\n\nto diderot adorned a portrait of confucius at the entrance to his study in fernay, Voltaire addresses confucius as follows:\n\nThe salutary interpreter of the simple virtue, who adores but one god and makes us love his law, who spoke as a sage and never as a prophet, and if there is a sage again he will think like you.$^{7}$^{3}\n\nThese  lines  contain  many  of  the  critical  motifs  which  characterize  the enlightenment attitude to religion as well as its interest in china: confucius is not a prophet-he does not claim access to a revelation which he would then preach in the name of a transcendent personal god. confucius is the sage who simply transmits a timeless, universally valid and 'simple,' neither secret- nor mystery-laden virtue or reason-both terms are interchangeable for the Iumières -without adding any curious inventions.$^{7}$^{4} he venerates the 'one god' of the deists, which is certainly directed against the christian dogma of the Trinity. chinese religion, Voltaire says, has never been adulterated by such 'absurd innovations,' and unlike the christian religion,  it  is  'free  of  all  superstition  and  barbarism.'$^{7}$^{5}  The  teaching  of confucius 'has never been disgraced by miracle tales nor been defiled by squabble and bloodshed'.$^{7}$^{6}\n\nI  have  given  an  overview  of  the  china  discourse  of  the  enlightenment and  its  systematic  interplay  with  the  secularistic  tendencies  of  the  age. It  cannot  be  doubted  that  the  Sinophilia  and  the  anti-religious  or  antiecclesiastical radicalism of the enlightenment are closely interconnected, although certainly not in all authors. The european development towards secularism  of  the  centuries  in  question  can  surely  not  be  sufficiently explained by external influences like the ones mentioned. It is to a large extent  the  outcome  of  an  internal  dynamics  of  a  gradual  decline  of  the medieval orbis christianus ,  the  separation of state and church beginning with  the  investiture  controversy  and  continuing  through  the  religious wars  and  their  consequences,  the  rise  of  trans-confessional  absolutism, and  finally  the  french  revolution  with  its  new  understanding  of  a  selfconstituting citizenry, the culmination point and core of the secularization\n\n$^{7}$^{3} 'de la simple vertu salutaire interprète, qui n'adoras qu'un dieu, qui fis aimer sa loi, toi qui parlas en sage, et jamais en prophète, s'il est un sage encore, il pense comme toi.'

It was due to the end of the Jesuit age in the aftermath of the rites controversy which threw a shadow on the positive picture of china. It was the end of the ancient regime and the french revolution with a new concept of progress that no longer looked to an idealized past. and it was the end of the Stoic unity of nature and reason that had provided the backbone of the philosophical chinoiserie. It was lastingly destroyed in herder's culturalism and in Kant's criticism.$^{7}$^{7} The principles of 'natural theology and morality,' says Kant, are in reality without 'sufficient evidence'.$^{7}$^{8}\n\nIn what follows, rationality transcends nature, and nature becomes the object of an irrational feeling. hegel has built his whole philosophical system on breaking up the 'occidental philosophy' of Spinozism in the name of subjectivity, the new 'principle of the modern world' which, as he says, is lacking in china.$^{7}$^{9} china remains where the enlightenment has put it: at  the  primordial  beginning.  however,  it  no  longer  bears  witness  to  the unadulterated light of nature, but to an unenlightened backwardness. In later  european  philosophy,  interest  in  china  has  mainly  been  linked  to the  anti-modern  romantic  rejection  of  so-called  occidental  reason,  and the part that it played in paving the way for modernity is no longer in the collective consciousness of western philosophy, as Taylor's A Secular Age shows.\n\nThere are only few notable exceptions. one of them is albert Schweitzer who  after  the  first  world  war  did  not  share  the  fashionable  romantic critique of 'civilization'. 'consciously and deliberately out of date,'$^{8}$^{0} he joined hands with the eighteenth century again and undertook a new congenial  interpretation  of  chinese  philosophy  on  the  basis  of  rationalism, hoping that china might bring europe back to what it had lost: the ethical\n\n$^{7}$^{7} for herder, cf. my article 'die chinesische Sprache und das chinesische denken,' 10f. $^{7}$^{8} Kant, Untersuchung  über  die  Deutlichkeit  der  Grundsätze  der  natürlichen  Theologie und Moral , 770 (a 96).\n\n$^{7}$^{9} hegel, Vorlesungen über die Philosophie der Geschichte ,  46  and 163, and Grundlinien der Philosophie des Rechts , §§ 273 and 124.\n\n$^{8}$^{0} cassirer, 'albert Schweitzer,' 245.\n\nconvictions of the age of enlightenment. however, Schweitzer is careful enough  not  to  simply  reinstall  the  problematic  'pre-critical'  cosmological backing of ethics that had brought the enlightenment on the side of china. In a much more thorough and sophisticated reading of the early confucian  texts,  he  recognizes  that  there  is  in  reality  only  a  weak  link between ethics and nature, yet still a necessary one without which ethics  would  be  suspended  in  mid-air.  using  one  of  his  wonderful  musical metaphors, he writes:\n\nfor the chinese, the belief in an ethical world order ( sittliche Weltordnung ) stands in the background, but not in the sense that ethics would be dependent on it. The order of the world is a kind of basic harmony upon which the motifs of ethics freely develop.$^{8}$^{1}\n\nIn  the  end,  the  'greatness'  of  confucius,  says  Schweitzer,  lies  in  'basing ethics on nothing else but itself and on the fact that it is necessary and true.'$^{8}$^{2}  whether  or  not  there  is  an  ethical  order  in  the  world  is  wholly dependent on humankind. Schweitzer, the theologian, admires confucius for  this  'venture'  of  a  secular  ethics  'out  of  its  own  power  without  any support in a corresponding faith'.$^{8}$^{3}\n\nhowever, are the secular and 'progressive' readings of confucianism convincing in the first place, regardless of how we evaluate their importance for the development of the enlightenment discourse? There are already sceptical voices in the eighteenth century. The religious vs. the secular nature of confucianism in particular has often been a topic of debate, with the pendulum swinging towards the religious  side  in  recent  decades.  for  example,  Tu  weiming,  perhaps  the  most  internationally  renowned  confucian thinker of the present day, defends the religious nature of confucianism and  uses  it  as  a  weapon  in  his  fight  against  what  he  calls  the  'secular humanism' of the 'enlightenment mentality'.$^{8}$^{4} according to this position, the enlightenment's resort to confucius must have been based on a severe misunderstanding.  That  the  knowledge  of  china  in  the  european  seventeenth and eighteenth century was much too limited to produce more than fantasy, myths, and 'images' has often been maintained. as a matter of fact, the  philosophers  of  the  enlightenment  went  too  far  in  their  idealization and stereotyping of the chinese empire. But it is not the case that more\n\n$^{8}$^{1}  Schweitzer, Geschichte des chinesischen Denkens , 261.\n\n$^{8}$^{2} Schweitzer, Geschichte des chinesischen Denkens , 92.\n\n$^{8}$^{3} Schweitzer, Geschichte des chinesischen Denkens , 86.\n\n$^{8}$^{4} cf.  my article 'confucianism between Tradition and modernity.'\n\ninformation  would  have  rendered  the  secular  reading  of  confucianism implausible-it could even have corroborated the thesis that elements of a secular civilization were a reality in china long before latter-day western philosophers strove  for  it.$^{8}$^{5}  The  most  important  text  in  this  respect,  the Book of Xunzi from the third century B.c., was not even known in europe. Xunzi 荀子 (hsün-tzu, ca. 310-230 B.c.) is the most decidedly a-religious of  all  thinkers  in  ancient  china.  a  rationalist  par  excellence,  he  regards institutions and morals as human inventions without religious or cosmological embedding and conceives of a state built on meritocracy and distributive justice rather than aristocratic descent$^{8}$^{6}-something that would have been to the taste of the european eighteenth century, although the naturalistic foundation is largely lacking.$^{8}$^{7}\n\nXunzi's materialism notwithstanding, there is a certain religious background  to  some  prominent  ethical  tenets  of  classical  confucianism. confucianism inherits the early Zhou religion which claims that heaven ( tian 天 ), a moral deity, confers a mandate ( ming 命 ) of rule to the most virtuous. The mandate of heaven ( tian ming 天命 ),  an 'external reason' of  morality  in  the  terminology  of  wolff,  is  later  turned  into  an  internal reason by declaring it a part of human nature in mengzi's ( 孟子 ca. 370290 B.c.) line of confucianism.$^{8}$^{8} It now becomes the moral law within the human being, where it is a source of moral dignity ( liang gui 良貴 )  surpassing the dignity given and taken away by the powerful.$^{8}$^{9} This theory of 'inner transcendence,' as it is called in contemporary new confucianism, together  with  its  imaginable  political  consequences,  comes  very  close to  wolff 's  interpretation  of  the  chinese philosophia  practica in  terms of  'internal  reason'  and  maturity  grounded  in  human's  natural  reason. This shift from the veneration of a moral deity to a normatively charged\n\n$^{8}$^{5} cf.  for this point also holenstein, 'china-eine altsäkulare Zivilisation.'\n\n$^{8}$^{6} cf.  my article 'Xunzi's Vision of Society.'\n\n$^{8}$^{7} cf.  roetz, Mensch  und  Natur  im  alten  China ,  §22.  for  a  full  translation  of  Xunzi's  works,  see  Knoblock, Xunzi. for  Xunzi's  philosophy  of  nature  see  above  all Xunzi chapter 17, 'on heaven.'\n\n$^{8}$^{8} In the Book of Mengzi and the Zhongyong . cf. Zhongyong 1: 'The mandate of heaven means inborn nature. To follow inborn nature means the teaching.' Quoted after Zhu Xi, Sishu jizhu . I deal with this turn in my article 'die Internalisierung des himmelsmandats.'\n\n$^{8}$^{9} cf. Mengzi 6a17: 'To desire dignity ( gui , also 'high standing,' 'honor') is an aspiration all men have in common. But every single human being has a dignity within himself which he only does not think of. what men [normally] esteem as dignity is not the good dignity ( liang gui ) . To whom [a potentate like] Zhao meng can confer dignity, Zhao meng can also degrade.' Quoted after Harvard Yenching Institute Sinological Index Series, A Concordance to Meng Tzu .\n\nanthropology can be viewed as a shift towards naturalizing and secularizing religion, although it does not completely abandon religious diction. The same applies to the european 'discovery of the intra-human sources of  benevolence,'  which  it  has  obviously  influenced  and  which,  according to Taylor, marks the turning point towards the 'secular age'. china's specific role for the enlightenment together with these actual changes in classical confucianism are sufficient reasons to think of global processes of  secularization  not  primarily  in  terms  of  modern  western  influences on the non-western world. They did not come about in modern europe for the first time in world history.\n\nBut why did the internalisation of morality, which links early confucianism  to  the  enlightenment  project,  not  yield  a  result  in  china similar  to  that  in  europe?  Zhang  Junmai  ( 張君勱 carsun  chang,  18861969),  one  of  most  prominent  chinese  philosophers  of  the  twentieth century,  has  tried  to  give  an  answer.  he  has  argued  that  confucianism and in particular mengzi, with his ethics of respect for the human being as  an ens  morale by  virtue  of  its  very  nature,  has  not  only  influenced enlightenment philosophy but also the declaration of human rights of the french revolution. when the human rights idea, 'the completion of the process of secularization,'$^{9}$^{0} later became known in china, it returned there,  as  it  were,  like  china's  own  grown-up  child.  The  chinese  'seeds' could sprout in the west under conditions more accommodative to them than were at hand in the east, above all because confucianism itself with its  hierarchical  inclinations  always  stood  in  its  own  way.  Zhang  Junmai may have overstated his case, but there is a grain of truth in it. regardless of what proportions, the development of enlightenment secular thought, to which we owe our modern democratic institutions, was not simply the offspring  of  the  cultural  genes  of  the  occident.  It  was  the  outcome  of  a trans-cultural joint venture.\n\n## Bibliography\n\nBayle, pierre. Dictionnaire Historique et Critique . amsterdam, 1730.\n\nBloch, ernst.
