Bracket as well issues of whether it was right to free offenders from both criminal and civil liability in exchange for the complete truth about their wrongdoing. There remain important ethical and legal questions to ask about this Act, one of which is this: Which additional burdens, if any, should be lifted from wrongdoers in the wake of according them freedom from judicial liability? For two recent examples that the Constitutional Court has considered: should having been  granted amnesty  for killings under apartheid  be understood to entail that a newspaper may not call one a 'murderer'?; or  should  an  officer  having  been  granted  such  amnesty  be  held  to mean  that  the  police  force  may  not  discharge  him  because  of conviction for a serious offence? What, if any, negative reputational, occupational and other consequences should those granted judicial amnesty for political crimes rightly suffer, and for which basic moral reasons?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n* Thaddeus  Metz,  BA  (Iowa)  MA  PhD  (Cornell),  Professor  of  Philosophy  (Research Focus), University of Johannesburg. I would like to acknowledge the useful input received from participants at a workshop sponsored by the South African Institute for Advanced Constitutional, Public, Human Rights and International Law (SAIFAC) and from those at a Social and Political Theory Seminar at the Australian National University's Research School of Social Sciences. I have also benefited from written comments  from  Stu  Woolman  and  a  thoughtful  referee  for  the Constitutional Court Review .\n- 1 Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act 34 of 1995.\n\nIn this article, I seek to answer these questions by philosophically reflecting on a Constitutional Court judgment that I shall abbreviate as ' Du Toit '. 2   Wybrand du Toit was a member of the South African Police  Service  (SAPS)  discharged  for  having  been  convicted  of murdering four people. Upon having been granted amnesty for these crimes, he sought reinstatement, and sued upon being denied it. The Court concluded that the SAPS was permitted not to reinstate Du Toit. Here, I distinguish the  different  major  ethical  or  'jurisprudential' 3 reasons the Court gives for its conclusion, avoiding the more narrowly pragmatic and legal ones; I argue that the moral rationales rest on empirical contingencies for which there is little evidence, and that their logic in fact provides some reason to reject the order in Du Toit ; and,  furthermore,  I  sketch  an  attractive  moral  philosophy  that  I maintain provides a stronger, unitary foundation for the Court's key pronouncements.\n\nAlthough I do take up the issue of defamation, which the Court is addressing as I write in a case I shall label ' McBride ', 4 I  do  so only briefly and as a consequence of thorough reflection on Du Toit . Robert McBride was granted amnesty for, among other things, having bombed a bar and thereby killed three people and wounded dozens. When he sought  an  administrative  appointment,  a  newspaper  published  an article that called him a 'murderer', and McBride sued for defamation. I will argue that just as Du Toit is not entitled to his job back,  so  the  Court  would  be  right,  for  the  same  basic  moralphilosophical reasons, to rule that McBride is not entitled to his name back.\n\nUltimately what is at stake in Du Toit and McBride is the precise sort of national reconciliation that is particularly desirable , an issue that it is apt to address with a moral philosophy. The one that I appeal to is grounded on values that are salient in the sub-Saharan region, often  put  under  the  title  of  ' ubuntu '  or  ' botho '  among  Nguni  and Sotho-Tswana speakers, respectively, in Southern Africa. I am aware that  legal  scholars  and  other  professionals  and  intellectuals  often criticise the idea that ubuntu can serve as a public morality. Many claim  that  it  is  particularistic,  vague,  illiberal,  anachronistic  and unsuitable  for  a  diverse  society.  In  recent  work,  I  have  sought  to interpret ubuntu in  a  way  that  avoids  these  problems;  I  have\n\n- 2 Wybrand Andreas Lodewicus Du Toit v Minister for Safety and Security of the Republic of South Africa &amp; the National Commissioner of the South African Police Service [2009] ZACC 22; 2010 1 SACR 1 (CC); 2009 12 BCLR 1171 (CC); (2009) 30 ILJ 2601 (CC).\n- 4 The Citizen (1978) (Pty) Ltd &amp; Others v Robert John McBride 2010 CCT 23/10.\n- 3 By 'jurisprudential' here I mean something like philosophically ideal. My question is: which judgment would be the best in light of a desire for moral soundness and factual  accuracy?  Sometimes  judges  have  the  most  reason not to  reason  in  a purely jurisprudential way, so construed; for example, they can have good reason to give weight to precedent that is morally or factually incorrect in some way.\n\narticulated an ethical theory with a recognisably sub-Saharan pedigree  that  is  principled,  clear,  gives  due  weight  to  individual liberty, is readily applicable to contemporary controversies and will be attractive to a wide array of reasonable citizens. 5  In this article, I show that a philosophically coherent and plausible account of ubuntu provides guidance about how to answer difficult and subtle questions about the kind of reconciliation that South Africa should be pursuing and  hence  about  the  proper  implications  of  amnesty  for  political crimes.\n\nI  begin  by  sketching  the  elements  of Du  Toit in  more  detail (section 2), bringing out the kind of amnesty the Court favours and the major, reconciliation-based rationales it offers for it. Specifically, the Court defends a judicial amnesty that induces offenders to disclose political  crimes  they  have  committed,  albeit  one  that  does  not prevent non-judicial institutions from responding negatively to them. I argue that the defences the Court gives for these elements are weak from a jurisprudential perspective, and that they need another source of support. Then, I show that they follow from a single, basic moral principle informed by ubuntu , which I first sketch (section 3) and then apply in the section after that (section 4). I conclude by discussing some of the broader implications of this moral-philosophical defence of Du Toit for other 2010 Constitutional Court cases, with particular reference to McBride (section 5).\n\n## 2 A critical analysis of Du Toit\n\nThis  section  is  partly  exegetical,  a  matter  of  putting  down  the essentials of the Du Toit case as they bear on the reconciliation-based arguments for amnesty, and also partly evaluative, an indication of why these arguments are implausible on both ethical and empirical grounds.\n\nAs  noted  above,  Du  Toit  was  a  member  of  the  SAPS,  and  was convicted, in 1996, of four counts of murder. He was subsequently discharged from the police service, in accordance with section 36(1) of the SAPS Act, 6  which says:\n\nA member who is convicted of an offence and is sentenced to a term of imprisonment  without  the  option  of  a  fine,  shall  be  deemed  to  have been discharged from the Service with effect from the date following the date of such sentence: Provided that, if such term of imprisonment\n\n- 5 T  Metz  'Toward  an  African  moral  theory'  (2007)  15 The  Journal  of  Political Philosophy 321; 'Human dignity, capital punishment, and an African moral theory:\n- toward a new philosophy of human rights' (2010) 9 Journal of Human Rights 81. 6\n- South African Police Service Act 68 of 1995.\n\nis  wholly  suspended,  the  member  concerned  shall  not  be  deemed  to have been so discharged.\n\nAs  the  four  killings  were  politically  motivated,  Du  Toit  sought  and eventually  received  amnesty  for  them  from  the  Committee  on Amnesty in accordance with the Reconciliation  Act,  subsequent  to which Du Toit tried to rejoin the SAPS, on two grounds. First, section 36(2)(a) of the SAPS Act permits an application for reinstatement if the officer's conviction is 'set aside following an appeal or review'. Second,  section  20(10)  of  the  Reconciliation  Act  states  that  with regard to those who have received amnesty any entry or record of the conviction shall be deemed to be expunged from all  official  documents  or  records  and  the  conviction  shall  for  all purposes, including the application of any Act of Parliament or any other law, be deemed not to have taken place ...\n\nHowever, the National Commissioner of the SAPS denied Du Toit's request, consequent to which Du Toit sued the National Commissioner as  well  as  the  Minister  in  charge  of  the  SAPS.  As  mentioned,  the Constitutional  Court  ruled  unanimously  in  favour  of  the  SAPS, maintaining  that  it  was  not  legally  required  to  reinstate  Du  Toit despite his having received amnesty for the killings.\n\n## 2.1 The nature of reconciliation\n\nWhat principally motivates the Court's ruling is a certain conception of national reconciliation and of how to achieve it. The Court takes the main point of the Reconciliation Act to be the 'building of bridges across racial, gender, class and ideological divides', 7  with amnesty an essential means for achieving it. 8\n\nNational reconciliation, the ultimate end, is not well defined in Du Toit . The most one gets is the intimation that it involves establishing the 'proper rule of law' and 'strengthening peace, democracy and justice.' 9  Such characterisations are wanting, however, because the granting of amnesty for political crimes is itself an infringement of the rule of law and hence also of justice, as the Court admits. 10  To be clear, the Court should have indicated the respects in which despite the rule of law and justice being infringed by amnesty, it would on the whole advance reconciliation. In addition, there are different kinds of peace and democracy, some of which are more desirable than others\n\n- 7 Du Toit (n 2 above) para 18.\n- 9 Du Toit (n 2 above) para 21.\n- 8 Du  Toit (n  2  above)  paras  19-20,  59;  see,  too,  the  epilogue  to  the  interim Constitution (Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Act 200 of 1993).\n- 10 Du Toit (n 2 above) paras 23-26.\n\nor properly understood as elements of reconciliation than others. My suggestion is not that the Court is wrong to mention values such as rule of law and democracy, but rather that these values are left vague insofar as they are meant to constitute reconciliation. Below I aim to be more specific about the relationship between reconciliation and these values.\n\nAnother hint from the Court about what reconciliation involves is the interesting suggestion of the offender being given 'a pardoned freedom  to  go  forth  and  contribute  to  society.' 11 That  value  is distinct, on the face of it, from those of the rule of law, peace and democracy. A certain understanding of justice might capture it, but the Court does not in Du Toit , so far as I can tell, associate talk of 'justice'  with  the  notion  of  offenders  doing  something  to  actively rebuild society. Furthermore, below I provide a theoretical account of reconciliation implying that they are rightly seen as different goods that nonetheless belong together as complementary elements of it.\n\n## 2.2 A truth-oriented amnesty\n\nAs indicated, the Court views amnesty to be a means to the end of national reconciliation, as construed above. And the Court believes that not just any amnesty would be likely to foster it, but rather one with  two  particular  characteristics.  First,  the  Court  upholds  the rationale behind the Reconciliation Act, which deems truth about the past in exchange for legal amnesty to be a 'necessary tool' 12  by which to attain reconciliation. While it is required 'to 'close the book' on the past', 13  the book must first be read. Why?\n\nThe  Court  maintains  that  only  upon  substantial  disclosure  of political crimes will living victims receive the 'closure' and 'solace' 14 that, in turn, are requisite for reconciliation to come about. Indeed, the Court says that the 'primary aim of the (Reconciliation) Act was to use the closure acquired as a stepping stone to reconciliation for the future'. 15\n\nBefore  considering  the  other  salient  element  of  the  Court's favoured  interpretation  of  amnesty,  let  us  pause  to  consider  the present  rationale.  In  standard  argumentative  form,  the  Court's argument for amnesty for political crimes is this:\n\n- 11 Du Toit (n 2 above) para 56.\n\n13 Du Toit (n 2 above) para 18.\n\n- 12 Du Toit (n 2 above) para 20.\n- 14 Du Toit (n 2 above) para 22; see also para 21.\n\n15 Du Toit (n 2 above) para 55.\n\n- (1) Reconciliation just is, in large part, a matter of establishing the rule of law, peace and democracy, 16  and it is the overriding value.\n- (2) Such reconciliation would not have (been as likely to) come about without closure and solace on the part of victims.\n- (3) Closure and solace on the part of victims would not have (been as likely  to)  come  about  without  them  having  substantially  apprehended the truth about political crimes.\n- (4) In  order  for  victims  to  have  substantially  apprehended  the  truth about political crimes, it was necessary to offer amnesty to offenders in exchange for full disclosure of their misdeeds.\n- (5) Therefore, a truth-oriented amnesty was appropriate.\n\nIn  the  following,  I  shall  often  refer  back  to  different  parts  of  this argument by invoking the numbered claim.\n\nI have raised concerns about (1) above, and now seek to question the other facets of the Court's reasoning, supposing, for the sake of argument, that (1) is true. The first thing to note about the logic of this argument is that it provides some ( pro tanto ) reason to come to a conclusion that is directly opposite to the one that the Court did in Du Toit . If (roughly) the more truth, the more reconciliation, then the state should do whatever it can to spare the guilty from suffering any burdens  they  might  undergo  consequent  to  revealing  the  truth, including extra-legal ones such as losing a job on the police force. The present argument for amnesty as a means to reconciliation not merely fails to underwrite the Court's ruling, but also appears to undermine it, something not acknowledged in Du Toit .\n\nIn reply, the Court could fairly remind us that the point of truth is to provide closure and solace, and suggest that these emotions on the part of victims would be hindered if the offenders were relieved of too many burdens. If that were true, then the logic of the argument would not contradict the Court's conclusion that Du Toit is not legally entitled to his job back. But, is it true? What is most likely to foster closure and solace: fewer burdens on the guilty and more truth about the past, or more burdens on the guilty and less truth about the past? I  submit  that  the  answer  to  this  question  is  unclear,  requiring substantial psychological studies that probably have  not  been conducted.\n\nThe rest of the argument similarly relies on empirical claims for which  there  is  equivocal  evidence  and  hence  provide  a  shaky foundation for a conclusion that amnesty should have been granted in exchange for truth. For one, it is not obvious that closure and solace\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 16 Considerations of the offender being able to contribute to society do not play a role in the present argument for amnesty.\n\non  the  part  of  victims  had  to  come  from  hearing  offenders  speak openly about the way they harmed them (3). After all, many urban victims  of  serious  crimes  such  as  home  invasion  and  rape  come  to terms with their lives even when the offenders are never seen again. And  in  many  traditional  sub-Saharan  societies,  people  appear  to accept  things  and  to  be  able  to  move  on,  even  when  there  is  no systematic enquiry into precisely who is guilty and for what. 17  On the face  of  it,  closure  and  solace  can  be  expected  to  come  from  the support of family and friends, from therapeutic treatment, and from the healing of time; it is not obviously conditional upon an offender recounting in public the gory details of what he did to one or one's intimates. Indeed, such recounting can simply cause more anger and other  negative  feelings, 18 meaning  there  is  again  the  threat  of 'backfire' in the Court's reasoning.\n\nSuppose,  now,  for  the  sake  of  argument,  that  the  Court  were correct about (3), namely, that emotions of solace and closure are most likely  to  be  experienced  consequent  to  the  negative  feelings that would naturally accompany hearing about the way oneself and one's loved ones were horribly wronged. Even if that were so, one would still have strong reason to question premise (2), the claim that closure and solace were necessary for reconciliation. If reconciliation is  primarily,  as  per  (1),  a  matter  of  the  rule  of  law,  peace  and democracy,  then  it  seems  that  reconciliation  would  be  feasible despite victims continuing to feel unresolved about what was done to them. After all, reconciliation in the Court's sense has come about in places like Argentina and Chile, where amnesty was granted without requiring disclosure, and, chances are, with less closure and solace on the  part  of  victims  there,  relative  to  those  in  South  Africa. 19   Why think  South  Africa  would  be  different,  requiring  more  closure  and solace  for  a  stable  political  equality  to  be  realised?  Again,  some\n\n- 17 For just one example, consider the Tiv, a people in Nigeria who forgo a reliable truth-seeking  process  for  the  sake  of  'repairing  the tar' ,  viz,  re-establishing harmonious relationships of a certain kind. For a summary, see RW Miller Moral differences (1992) 21.\n\nChile is well known for the 'self-pardon' or 'self-amnesty' law by which General Pinochet's military  government  absolved  all those guilty  of  human  rights violations done during the 1970s state of siege. In the last two years, high-ranking officials of the Pinochet regime have been arrested, but my point is that peace, democracy, basic justice and the rule of law were largely achieved prior to that unexpected  turn  of  events.  Similarly,  Argentina  adopted  a  law  that  absolved those below the rank of colonel for political crimes committed during the 'Dirty War' of the late 1970s and early 1980s, and those high-ranking officers who had been convicted were subsequently pardoned. In the late 1990s foreign governments began prosecuting high-ranking officers, but, again, my point is that by  then  Argentina  had  already  realised  peace,  the  rule  of  law  and  so  on.  For succinct overviews of these and other amnesties, see N Roht-Arriaza &amp; L Gibson 'The  developing  jurisprudence  on  amnesty'  (1998)  20 Human Rights  Quarterly 843.\n\n- 18 S Daley 'In apartheid inquiry, agony is relived but not put to rest' New York Times 7 July 1997. 19\n\nsubstantial social science must be undertaken in order to answer this question with confidence.\n\nBefore turning to the second argument the Court gives for the kind of amnesty it favours, I summarise by noting that the first one, at worst,  provides  reason  to  think  that  Du  Toit  was  in  fact  legally entitled to his job back (as removing extra-legal burdens such as job loss probably would have fostered more truth), and, at best, provides no reason to think that he was not so entitled. If the argument were successful,  the  most  it  could  demonstrate  is  that  the  right  sort  of amnesty to have offered offenders was one conditional on disclosure of political crimes. But, as I have argued, the premises that the Court invokes in favour of a truth-oriented amnesty are weak, relying on controversial empirical claims about people's psychologies. Below I will suggest that the Court, the drafters of the Constitution, and the first set of Parliamentarians were in fact correct to seek out a truthoriented amnesty, but I shall suggest some principles that provide a less empirical and overall more solid ground for it.\n\n## 2.3 An amnesty that does not favour the guilty\n\nIn Du Toit , the Court denies that a truth-oriented amnesty is sufficient to bring about the kind of reconciliation it prizes. In addition, the Court maintains, for there to have emerged peace, the rule of law, basic democratic procedures, etc, an amnesty was necessary that did not relieve the guilty of too many burdens. On the one hand, amnesty had to foster truth, as per the Court's first argument above, and so had to waive judicial liability in exchange for disclosure of political crimes,  but,  on  the  other  hand,  amnesty  must  not  have  given  the guilty a disproportionately great share of relief. Why think so, and, more pertinently, why think a concern for a balance of burdens among the parties would entail the conclusion that Du Toit was not entitled to reinstatement with the SAPS?\n\nMost of the Court's rationale for thinking that the right sort of amnesty required a balance of burdens is instrumental , that is, that an amnesty that does not grossly favour the guilty is more likely to result in reconciliation than one that does. 20  The Court unfortunately\n\n20 For  talk  of  balance  as  needed  to  achieve  'goals'  and  'aims',  see Du  Toit (n  2 above)  paras  50,  52-53,  55.  There  is  some  evidence  that  the  Court  also  has  a different, non-instrumental argument for favouring a balance of burdens, when it says in Du Toit (n 2 above): 'This interplay of benefit and disadvantage is essential to the process and to the desired result, namely, the emergence of objectives fundamental to the ethos of the constitutional order' (para 29), and ' &gt; T @ o grant disproportionate benefit to one party at the expense of the other would be unjust and  would  strike  at  the  equilibrium  envisaged  by  the  Constitution'  (para  30). These remarks suggest that, for the Court, there is something intrinsically right\n\ndoes  not  provide  any  reason  to  believe  that  this  is  true,  resting content with statements such as: ' &gt; I @ t cannot be correct to say that the Reconciliation Act was enacted in order to ameliorate hardship for the perpetrators  of human  rights  abuses  ... To  interpret  the Reconciliation Act in this way would not be to ensure that it achieves its aims but would, in fact, be flouting those aims by extending too far the already delicate and difficult issue of amnesty.' 21  Presumably, though,  the  Court  is  relying  on  psychological  claims  of  the  sort  it invokes in the prior argument, the suggestion being that the victims of  apartheid  would  have  continued  to  feel  aggrieved  and  full  of vengeance  and  hence  would  not  have  set  aside  violence  and accommodated  themselves  to  a  democratic  order,  had  the  guilty received any relief beyond freedom from criminal and civil liability for political crimes.\n\nIn standard argumentative form, the present rationale is this:\n\n- (1) Reconciliation just is, in large part, a matter of establishing the rule of law, peace and democracy and of previous offenders contributing to society.\n- (2) Such reconciliation would not have (been as likely to) come about had the guilty received 'the lion's share of benefits' 22  from the amnesty process.\n- (3) Enabling those who received amnesty to be legally entitled not to be fired for having engaged in political crimes, on top of receiving freedom from  judicial  liability  for  them,  would  have  been  for  them  to  have received 'the lion's share of benefits'.\n- (4) Therefore,  the  right  sort  of  amnesty  was  one  that  did  not  allow those who had received amnesty to be legally entitled not to be fired for having engaged in political crimes.\n\nAgain referring to the argument's numbered elements, premises (2) and  (3)  are  highly  questionable.  Insofar  as  reconciliation  involves previous offenders doing what they can to rebuild society, that would on the face of it suggest, contra (2)  and  (3),  allowing  Du  Toit  and similar offenders to have kept their jobs. Supposing Du Toit was a good police officer, in the sense of able to enforce the law, whatever it may be, then he could have done good for South African society by enforcing more just and democratically formulated laws in the post1994 era. There is, again, an element in the Court's reasoning that pulls  in  a  direction  away  from  its  conclusion  and  that  should  be addressed.\n\n21\n\nabout an amnesty providing a balance of burdens between victims and offenders, but,  unfortunately,  this  is  literally  all  the  Court  says  on  the  matter ,  failing  to elaborate on why an imbalance would in itself be an unjust process.\n\nDu Toit\n\n(n 2 above) para 55.\n\nDu Toit\n\n(n 2 above) para 53.\n\nThe  Court  could  naturally  reply  that  the  facet  of  offender contribution  to  society  is  less  important  than  the  other  facets  of reconciliation such as peace and democracy. That point is fair. But it would  also  have  to  claim  that  these,  more  weighty  facets  of reconciliation  were  best  fostered  by  not  giving  Du  Toit  any  more benefits, such as legal protection from discharge from the SAPS for having  been  convicted  of  serious  crimes.  And  this  claim  remains dubious. I again note that other societies such as Chile and Argentina have achieved peaceful and democratic societies with amnesties that were much more generous to those guilty of political crimes. Indeed, blanket  amnesties  were  given,  instead  of  having  made  amnesty conditional  on  truth-telling,  and,  furthermore,  residents  of  both countries expected that a large majority of offenders in the military would keep their jobs. 23  And reconciliation in Iraq has been long in coming, in large part because members of the Ba'ath Party were not allowed to stay in the army. 24  What reason was there to think that South Africa would be different? It is true that South Africans were largely  unhappy with the idea of previous offenders facing neither criminal nor civil liability for their political crimes, but what evidence is there to think that protecting them from job loss would have been the proverbial straw the broke the camel's back?\n\nIn addition, even if one grants (2), that the guilty must not benefit much more than the victims from an amnesty process in order for reconciliation  to  be  likely,  (3)  is  still  doubtful.  There  are  many different ways to balance the burdens and benefits of an amnesty. A major  part  of  the  Truth  and  Reconciliation  Commission's  (TRC's) mandate  was  supposed  to  include  substantial  reparations  paid  to immediate  victims  of  human  rights  abuses.  As  is  well  known,  the government rejected many of the TRC's recommendations in these respects. However, had it upheld them, might that benefit not have been  comparable  to  protecting Du  Toit from being fired for conviction?\n\nThe likely reply will be that, since, as a matter of historical fact, the  government  did  not  effect  substantial  compensation  to  those most wrongfully harmed under apartheid, the Court was right not to protect Du Toit in order to achieve the right balance. However, there was another path it could have taken. It could have protected Du Toit while instructing Parliament, or encouraging other elements of the government, to work to improve the lives of those most victimised by apartheid.  In  short,  why  'level  down'  when  the  Court  could  have instead  'levelled  up', particularly  when  levelling  up  in  this  case might  have  enabled  Du  Toit  and  those  like  him  to  contribute  to\n\n23\n\n24 Often cited as one of the biggest mistakes of the Coalition Forces in the post-war period.\n\nSee n 19 above.\n\nsociety , another facet of the Court's conception of reconciliation? The logic  of  balancing  burdens  and  benefits  yet  again  threatens  to 'backfire', supporting a different ruling with regard to whether the SAPS was legally permitted to fire Du Toit for having been convicted of political crimes.\n\nIn  sum,  the  present  argument  for  an  amnesty  that  balances burdens,  like  the  first,  rests  on  empirical  claims  that  lack  the requisite backing; it is far from clear that reconciliation would have been much less likely had the guilty received more relief from burdens than they did receive. Furthermore, it is far from clear that the only or even best way to balance burdens was to allow Du Toit to be fired for having been convicted of political crimes - indeed, there is some reason to think just the opposite. As with the first argument, I agree with the Court's conclusion that the right sort of amnesty would not have protected Du Toit from being discharged, but, in the rest of this article, I seek to provide a different foundation for that judgment, not one that rests on contingencies that doubtfully obtain or that might in fact give us reason to reject the Court's ruling.\n\n## 3 Ubuntu as a moral theory\n\nIn the previous section, I laid out the Court's two reconciliation-based rationales  for  a  truth-oriented  amnesty  that  balances  burdens between  victims  and  offenders,  which  kind  of  amnesty  the  Court thinks supports the conclusion that the SAPS was permitted to fire Du Toit for having been convicted of political crimes. I have noted that I believe the Court's conclusion is correct, but I have indicated that I find its two major arguments to be inadequate. Both rest crucially on empirical claims that might well be false, and the logic of both in fact provides some reason to reject the Court's conclusion. In this section, I articulate a basic moral principle that, when applied to Du Toit in the following section, will be seen to avoid these two problems.\n\n## 3.1 A philosophical interpretation of ubuntu\n\nIn other research I have, in effect, been working to make good on the Constitutional  Court's  suggestion  that  Southern  African  morality, often captured by the term ' ubuntu ', is the 'underlying motif of the Bill of Rights' 25 , as well as former Constitutional Court Justice Albie Sachs' assertion that ubuntu is  'intrinsic  to  and  constitutive of our\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n25 Port  Elizabeth  Municipality  v  Various  Occupiers [2004]  ZACC  7;  2005  1  SA  217 (CC); 2004 12 BCLR 1268 (CC) para 37.\n\nconstitutional  culture'. 26   I  have  sought  to  interpret  the  values commonly associated with talk of ' ubuntu ' (and cognate terms such as  ' botho '  in  Sotho-Tswnana  and  ' hunhu '  in  Shona)  in  a  way  that jurists  and  other  professionals  could  and  plausibly  should  use  to resolve contemporary problems. 27  I do not have the space here to demonstrate  systematically  that  the  following,  moral-philosophical construal of Southern African ethics avoids the myriad objections that are routinely made to it, such as being too vague to apply with rigor by  a  judge,  or  too  illiberal  to  apply  with  any  plausibility  in  a pluralistic, Constitutional order. Instead, I simply lay out the principle and then apply it to the basic value of national reconciliation, hoping the reader will glean from the next two sections that it is attractive and can be fruitfully invoked to  resolve jurisprudential disputes in South Africa.\n\nThe starting point for understanding ubuntu in  any  form  is  the ubiquitous maxim, 'A person is a person through other persons', which is ' Umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu ' in the Nguni languages of Zulu, Xhosa and Ndebele. Far from merely expressing a sociological banality about the fact that an individual is always part of a community, this maxim is  in  the  first  instance  a  normative  exhortation  to  individuals  to develop  their ubuntu ,  literally  their humanness,  personhood or virtue , through certain kinds of communal relationships. As Desmond Tutu  sums  up  the  way  sub-Saharans  characteristically  conceive  of morality:\n\nWhen we want to give high praise to someone we say, ' Yu, u nobuntu '; 'Hey, so-and-so has ubuntu .' Then you are generous, you are hospitable, you are friendly and caring and compassionate. You share what you have ... Harmony, friendliness, community are great goods. Social harmony is for us the summum bonum - the greatest good. Anything that subverts or undermines this sought-after good is to be avoided like the plague. Anger,  resentment,  lust  for  revenge,  even  success  through  aggressive competitiveness, are corrosive of this good. 28\n\nEssentially, to have ubuntu is to be a mensch , where those who enter into a certain kind of communion with others thereby manifest human excellence, and where those who have not are lacking it. Just as 'an unjust  law  is  no  law  at  all'  (Augustine),  so  sub-Saharans  would typically say of one who does not relate communally that 'he is not a person', and, indeed, those who are downright anti-social are often labelled 'animals'. 29\n\n- 26 Dikoko v Mokhatla [2006] ZACC 10; 2006 6 SA 235 (CC); 2007 1 BCLR 1 (CC) para 113.\n- See n 5 above.\n- 27\n- 28 D Tutu No future without forgiveness (1999) 31 35.\n- 29 MJ  Bhengu Ubuntu:  the  essence  of  democracy (1996)  27;  M  Letseka  'African philosophy  and  educational  discourse'  in  P  Higgs et  al (eds) African  voices  in education (2000) 186.\n\nThis  much  about  the  ethic  of ubuntu is  fairly  uncontroversial; nearly all those familiar with Southern African morality would accept that its core includes the general idea that one's basic aim should be to live a genuinely human way of life by entering into community with others. Things become contested upon specifying the relevant others and the relevant sort of community to seek out with them, which I now address. The reader should keep in mind that I am not trying to represent  any  traditional  African  belief  system  about  morality  in detail, but am rather drawing on a variety of them selectively in order to create a plausible jurisprudence with a Southern African pedigree . Given that constructive orientation, I submit that the following is a philosophically  attractive  way  of  understanding  what  it  is  to  prize community with others that is grounded in Mzanzi moral thought.\n\nAs I have argued elsewhere, community as a fundamental moral value in African philosophy is best understood not as a collection of actual social norms, but rather as an ideal form of social interaction, one  composed  of  two  logically  distinct  relationships  that  I  call 'identity' and 'solidarity'. 30 To identify with each other is largely for people to think of themselves as members of the same group, that is, to conceive of themselves as a 'we', for them to take pride or feel shame in the group's activities, as well as for them to engage in joint projects,  coordinating  their  behaviour  to  realise  shared  ends.  For people  to  fail  to  identify  with  each  other  could  go  beyond  mere alienation and involve outright division between them, in other words people thinking of themselves as an 'I' in opposition to a 'you', and aiming to undermine one another's ends.\n\nTo exhibit solidarity with one another is for people to engage in mutual aid, to act in ways that are reasonably expected to benefit each other. Solidarity is also a matter of people's attitudes such as emotions and motives being positively oriented toward others, say, by sympathising with them and helping them for their sake. For people to fail to exhibit solidarity  would  be  for  them  either  to  be uninterested in each other's flourishing or to exhibit ill-will in the form of hostility and cruelty.\n\nIdentity and solidarity are conceptually separable, meaning that one could  in  principle  exhibit  one  sort  of  relationship  without  the other.  For  instance,  workers  and  management  in  a  capitalist  firm often identify with one another (as in 'We are Telkom'), but since typical  workers  neither  labour  for  the  sake  of  managers  nor  are sympathetic  toward  them,  solidarity  between  them  is  lacking.\n\n30\n\nMuch of the following few paragraphs draw on Metz 'Human dignity' (n 5 above) 83-84.\n\nConversely,  one  could  exhibit  solidarity  without  identity,  say,  by helping someone anonymously.\n\nAlthough  identity  and  solidarity  are  logically  and  sociologically distinct, characteristic Southern African worldviews include the idea that,  morally,  they  ought  to  be  realised  together.  Communal relationship with others, of the sort that confers ubuntu on one, is well construed as the combination of identity and solidarity. To begin to see the appeal of this outlook, consider that identifying with others can be cashed out in terms of sharing a way of life and that exhibiting solidarity with others is naturally understood in terms of caring about their  quality  of  life.  Or,  as  former  Constitutional  Court  Justice Mokgoro has put it, ubuntu 's key value is 'achieved through close and sympathetic  social  relations  within  the  group'. 31 And  the  union  of sharing a way of life, or being close, and caring about others' quality of  life,  or  being  sympathetic,  is  basically  what  people  mean  by  a broad  sense  of  'love'  or  'friendship'.  Hence,  one  major  strand  of Southern African culture places loving or friendly relationships at the heart of morality, the present analysis having made explicit sense of Tutu's terse statement above.\n\nNow, which are the others with whom one ought to identify and exhibit solidarity in order to develop ubuntu ? With whom must one prize friendly relationships so as to live a genuinely human way of life? Traditionally speaking, the answer would include spiritual beings such as God and ancestors, wise progenitors of a clan who have survived the death of their bodies. However, I instead draw on another, less contested idea salient in Southern African moral thinking, namely, the view  that  humanity  has  a  dignity,  a  non-instrumental  value  that exceeds anything else on the planet. If human beings are characteristically  the  most  special  beings,  then  it  makes  sense  to think that we would obtain ubuntu by communing with them.\n\nThere is the further question of what it is that gives human beings a dignity. In virtue of what are they so special? Again, the traditional answer would be that they have a certain kind of vitality that has its source in God. However, I instead appeal to another Southern African idea, that human beings have a dignity in virtue of their capacity for community. 32  What makes us more important than other beings in the animal, vegetable and mineral kingdoms is, roughly, that we have a capacity to love that they do not. The way to treat people who are\n\n- 31 Y  Mokgoro  ' Ubuntu and  the  law  in  South  Africa'  (1998)  1 Potchefstroom Electronic Law Journal 3.\n- 32 See, eg. H Russel Botman 'The OIKOS in a global economic era' in JR Cochrane &amp; B Klein (eds) Sameness and difference: problems and potentials in South African civil society (2000) http://www.crvp.org/book/Series02/II-6/chapter\\_x.htm (accessed 31 January 2011); B Bujo Foundations of an African ethic (2001) 88; Metz 'Human dignity' (n 5 above).\n\nspecial  in  virtue  of  their  capacity  for  identity  and  solidarity  is naturally to prize such relationships with them.\n\n- I  began  this  moral-philosophical  interpretation  of ubuntu by noting  the  maxim  widely  taken  to  summarise  Southern  African morality,  'A  person  is  a  person  through  other  persons.'  Having provided some background to it, as well as proffered some definitions of terms, the reader now has a fairly rich understanding of what this initially opaque phrase means, at least for jurisprudential purposes. A less  literal  but  more  accurate  and  useful  translation  of  the  phrase would be: 'One should become  a real person by respecting relationships  of  identity  and  solidarity  with  those  able  to  do  so  in turn,' or 'One ought to develop one's humanness, which can be done only by honouring friendly relationships with those who have a dignity by virtue of being capable of friendliness themselves.'\n\n## 3.2 Appeal of the principle\n\nBefore applying this ethical theory to issues of national reconciliation and amnesty, I note some of its prima facie attractiveness as a public morality.  To  begin,  briefly  consider  what  it  is  that  makes  actions wrong. What do murder, rape, kidnapping, assault, theft, promisebreaking,  lying,  insults  and  the  like  have  in  common? Ubuntu , interpreted as a moral philosophy, would capture their impermissibility  roughly  in  terms  of  the  fact  that  these  acts  are unfriendly , or, more carefully, that they fail to respect friendship or the capacity for it. Actions such as deception, coercion  and exploitation  fail  to  honour  the  value  of  communal  relationships  in that:  the  actor  is  distancing  himself  from  the  person  acted  upon, instead of enjoying a sense of togetherness; the actor is subordinating the other, as opposed to coordinating behaviour with her; the actor is failing  to  act  for  the  good  of  the  other,  but  rather  for  his  own  or someone else's interest; or the actor lacks positive attitudes toward the other's good, and is instead unconcerned or malevolent.\n\nAlso consider how the present interpretation of ubuntu is able to underwrite  several  of  the  key  moral  judgments  that  are  often associated with it, particularly by the Constitutional Court. First, note that  traditional  African  societies  are  well  known  for  having  been hospitable  toward  strangers.  It  was  customary  for  a  traveller  to  a foreign village to be welcomed with food and shelter, for a time, even to  the  point  where  choice  morsels  of  meat  would  be  given  to  the stranger rather than to family members. Such an understanding of the importance of ubuntu -based neighbourliness clearly motivates Justice Mokgoro, and the rest of the Constitutional Court following her lead, when  she  rules  in Khosa  v  Minister  of  Social  Development that permanent residents, and not citizens alone, are entitled to welfare\n\ngrants from the state. 33  A duty to be inclusive with respect to the distribution of social benefits is well explained by the idea that all human beings have a dignity that warrants respectful treatment by fostering communal relationships with them.\n\nFor another example, in the State v Makwanyane the Constitutional  Court  famously  ruled  that  the  death  penalty  is inconsistent  with  what  an ubuntu ethic  prescribes. 34 Ubuntu ,  as construed  here,  does  entail  that  capital  punishment  is  unjust. 35 Basically, if we are to prize friendly relationships, ones of identity and solidarity, we generally ought to avoid their unfriendly opposites, of division and ill-will. Unfriendly types of actions such as coercion can be morally justified, but most clearly on the present ethic when (and perhaps only when) necessary to counteract another's own proportionate unfriendliness. Being unfriendly when essential to stop someone else from being comparably unfriendly, or to protect the victims of his similar unfriendliness, does not degrade his capacity for friendliness, which he has elected to misuse. The key point, now, is that  the  death  penalty  does  not  serve  the  function  of  treating someone in an unfriendly way for the sake of preventing a comparable unfriendliness on his part. It is an extremely unfriendly behaviour that is unnecessary to rebut the offender's own proportionately unfriendly behaviour;  his  crime  is  over,  and  any  good  that  his  victims  would receive  from  his  execution  now  would  be  disproportionate  to  the severe unfriendliness inflicted on him.\n\nFor a final application in a judicial context, it is well known that a retributive approach to punishment is not the dominant theme in Southern African thinking about criminal justice, where retribution is understood to be a 'backward-looking' approach that bases penalties solely on facts about the nature of the crime committed in the past. This is to say neither that traditional Southern Africans have never acted on retributive or vengeful sentiments, nor that they have never thought  of  spirits  as  aptly  meting  out  just  deserts.  However,  the salient  approaches  to  crime  and  conflict  resolution  in  indigenous communities have tended to be 'forward-looking', basing penalties on facts about the future, such as whether they are likely to serve the functions  of  appeasing  angry  ancestors  or  mending  broken  ties between offenders and the rest of the community. So acknowledges the  High  Court  in S  v  Joyce  Maluleke ,  where  it  ruled  that  African customary law should be given consideration in its favouring\n\n- 33 Khosa v Minister of Social Development &amp; Others [2004] ZACC 11; 2004 6 SA 505 (CC); 2004 6 BCLR 569 (CC).\n- 35 The following, compressed rationale is elaborated in more detail in Metz 'Human dignity' (n 5 above) 91-94.\n- 34 State v Makwanyane &amp; Mchunu [1995] ZACC 3; 1995 6 BCLR 665; 1995 3 SA 391.\n\nrestorative  justice  over  retributive  justice, 36 a  ruling  that  Justice Sachs invokes in Dikoko v  Mokhatla . 37 And, again, a moralphilosophical prescription to honour communal relationships neatly underwrites a strong interest in restorative justice; the right response to crime will be roughly what is likely to foster relationships in which people think of themselves as common members of a group and act for one another's sake.\n\nThis last example brings us to the topic of national reconciliation. As was noted in the epilogue to the interim Constitution, and as the Constitutional Court has recognised in AZAPO v President of South Africa and other places, 38 a natural interpretation of ubuntu indicates that  reconciliation  is  a  higher-order  value  to  be  sought  out,  if necessary at the expense of punishment that would ordinarily come with respect for the rule of law. In the following section, I articulate the sort of reconciliation that ubuntu as  a  moral  philosophy prescribes, indicating how it encompasses the more limited idea of it articulated in Du Toit ,  and  then  I  indicate  how  such  reconciliation could not be achieved without the conception of amnesty the Court favours in Du Toit .\n\n## 4 Applying ubuntu as a moral theory to Du Toit\n\nI  am  seeking  a  more  principled  foundation  for  a  truth-oriented amnesty that distributes burdens in such a way that apartheid-era offenders could still face extra-judicial harms such as losing a job. In the previous section, I spelled out a moral-theoretic interpretation of ubuntu that instructs agents to prize communal or friendly relationships, ones of sharing a way of life with others and of caring for their quality of life. I suggested that this philosophical construal of ubuntu is prima  facie  attractive for  providing  a  promising explanation  of  what  makes  actions  wrong  and  for  underwriting  a variety of particular Constitutional judgments associated with ubuntu ,  such as the importance of hospitality, the injustice of the death penalty and the insignificance of retribution. I now apply this ethical principle to issues of national reconciliation and the proper form that amnesty should take so as to facilitate it.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 36 State v Joyce Maluleke &amp; Others ,  Pretoria  High  Court,  case  number  83/04,  13 June 2006 per Bertelsmann J.\n- 38 Azanian Peoples Organisation (AZAPO) &amp; Others v President of the Republic of South Africa &amp; Others [1996] ZACC 16; 1996 8 BCLR 1015; 1996 4 SA 672; see also Sachs J's comments in Dikoko (n 26 above) paras 105-121.\n- 37 See n 26 above, para 115.\n\n## 4.1 Ubuntu -based reconciliation\n\nNational reconciliation is a stage in a country's ethical development that can come consequent to a major breach between large segments of its population. For citizens to become reconciled to a political set up is not necessarily for it to ideally realise justice, or even for them to perceive it as doing such. 39 Instead, national reconciliation consists of certain minimal conditions that make it possible to progress in the right direction. For the Constitutional Court in Du Toit , as we have seen, reconciliation basically consists of the establishment of peace, the rule of law, some basic democratic norms and the contribution of offenders toward rebuilding society. Here, I maintain that, in light of ubuntu , national reconciliation can be seen to include these elements, as they are part of the relevant sort of community to build, but that it also includes more.\n\nFrom the perspective of ubuntu as a moral theory, reconciliation should be seen as a substantial step on the path toward realising a society that fully respects communal relationships, ones of identity and solidarity. Respecting a value includes creating it, protecting it and fostering it. So, it will help at this point first to indicate what a society that has fully realised community in the relevant sense would look like, and then to 'work down' to something lesser, to a society that has partially realised it in a way that could realistically lead to something more robust in the future.\n\nAbove I noted that community of the sort that plausibly ought to exist, for much Southern African philosophy, consists of relationships of identity and solidarity. What would it be for members of a society to do their utmost to identify with one another? This would involve both behavioural and psychological elements. In terms of behaviour, it would involve what  I have been abbreviating 'coordinated activities' or 'joint projects', which at their fullest include interaction  that  is  done:  on  a  transparent  basis  (rather  than  on  a misinformed  one);  on  a  free  basis  (rather  than  out  of  coercion  or exploitation); out of trust (rather than suspicion); for the sake of ends that are shared, or at least compatible (rather than conflicting); for the  sake  of  ends  that  are  higher-order  and  hence  would  involve substantial sacrifice to achieve (as opposed to a weak commitment); and for the sake of the end of identity itself, in other words, doing something  because  'this  is  who  we  are'.  With  regard  to  the  more purely psychological elements of identifying with others, people fully do so insofar as they: think of themselves primarily as a 'we', that is, as joint members of a group (as opposed to an 'us' and 'them'); and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 39 As D Moellendorf reminds us with clarity in 'Reconciliation as a political value' (2007) 38 Journal of Social Philosophy 205.\n\ntake  pride  in  one  another's  accomplishments,  and  shame  in  their failures (rather than not feeling a part of what others do). When all these conditions are realised, then people fully belong, or genuinely share a way of life with each other.\n\nConsider, now, what a robust form of solidarity would be, which would also include behavioural and psychological aspects. In terms of behaviour, it would include people: aiming to do what is good for others (as opposed  to merely foreseeing benefit to  them  or accidentally effecting it); doing what is likely to be good for others (as opposed to likely to harm them or to have no effect); engaging in mutual  aid  over  time  (as  opposed  to  not  returning  benefits); expressing  gratitude  for  benefits  received  (rather  than  expecting tribute); and making the other's friendly character a benefit that one aims to confer on her. Focusing, now, on the more strictly mental dimensions  of  solidarity,  this  would  include  judging  others  to  be worthy of help (rather than of mere indirect consideration); being motivated to help others for their own sake (as opposed to one's longterm  self-interest);  and  exhibiting  emotions  such  as  sympathy,  in other words, feeling good when others flourish and bad when they flounder  (rather  than  being  indifferent).  Again,  when  all  these conditions obtain, people fully exhibit good-will with regard to each other, or truly seek to care for others' quality of life.\n\nIt would be expecting too much from the concept of reconciliation for  it  to  include  the  full  realisation  of  identity  and  solidarity,  as adumbrated  above.  Reconciliation  must  rather  be  understood  to consist of only some of these elements. After a period of great social conflict,  one  cannot  expect  people's  attitudes  to  change  quickly, whereas their behaviour can. Although immediately after World War II many Germans continued to favour Hitler's policies, and even today anti-semitism  remains  a  problem  among  them, 40   they  nonetheless conformed to a constitutional order that was imposed by the Allies. What  changes  to  mind-set  there  were  came  later.  Similarly,  if reconciliation  is  a  stepping  stone  toward  a  society  of  genuine community, then it is plausible to think of it as consisting mainly of the behavioural facets of identity and solidarity, and not so much the purely attitudinal ones. Of course, people's hearts and minds would need to change to some degree in order to move from a conflictridden society, that is, one of division and ill-will, to one with the core,  behavioural  components  of  identity  and  solidarity  as  above. However, they would need to do so to a much lesser degree than they would in order to be, say, motivated by altruism, to have sympathetic\n\n40 'New AJC survey finds negative attitudes towards Jews widespread in Germany' http://www.ajc.org/site/apps/nl/content2.asp?c=ijITI2PHKoG&amp;b=837277&amp;ct=87 1875 (accessed 31 January 2011).\n\nemotional reactions toward others, and to think of themselves as a 'we'.\n\nSo, I suggest that the friend of ubuntu should construe national reconciliation as a condition in which:\n\n- (a)  residents  in  a  country  interact  on  a  largely  free,  informed  and trustworthy  basis  for  the  sake  of  ends  that  are  compossible  and  the content  of  which  largely  includes  not  only  doing  what  will  help  one another,  but  also doing  so  in a reciprocal fashion,  where  (a)  is consequent to (b) serious social conflict that (c), when involving serious injustice,  is  disavowed  by  at  least  public  institutions,  if  not  also substantial numbers of offenders.\n\nThe (b) condition is uncontroversial, an indication merely that the concept of reconciliation implies a prior condition of discord. The (c) condition is more controversial than (b), indicating that reconciliation is  properly understood to be a condition that follows from societal recognition of a serious wrong having been done. Although sometimes people who have fought and some of whom have been treated wrongly are able to come together and repair the relationship without thinking in  terms of wrongdoing, or at least expressing themselves in those terms, the suggestion here is that, in cases of gross injustice, such 'reconciliation'  is  not  particularly  desirable.  To  honour  community means  acknowledging  when  it  has  been  seriously  undermined  in wrongful  ways,  and  to  treat  people  as  special  in  virtue  of  their capacity for community means responding to them in light of the way they have greatly misused this capacity. The (a) condition, of course, is more controversial, and, as I demonstrate below, takes us beyond the Court's construal of reconciliation, while including it.\n\nBefore considering the kind of amnesty that would be essential for attaining this ubuntu -based conception of reconciliation, I compare it with the Constitutional Court's understanding of reconciliation in Du Toit .  First,  the  Afro-communal  notion  obviously  underwrites  the intuition  that  essential  to  reconciliation  is  a  state  of  peace  that follows a state of violence. Violence is a condition in which, in part, parties seek to undermine one another's ends and to harm each other. That  is  ruled  out,  by  definition,  insofar  as  reconciliation  involves seeking ends that are compatible with those of others and engaging in mutual aid.\n\nSecond, less obviously, this account of reconciliation can make sense of it partially consisting of the rule of law, something that of course is not entailed by a peaceful condition alone (viz, something that a Hobbesian sovereign could ensure). Rule by law, and not of men (people),  centrally  consists  of  a  condition  in  which  all  in  society, including those who make the laws, are subject to them, and in which an independent judiciary exists to interpret and enforce the laws,\n\nagain,  if  necessary  against  those  who  have  made  the  law  but subsequently broken it. It is a condition that serves the function of preventing an arbitrary exercise of power on the part of those who control the state, where arbitrariness is plausibly understood to be inconsistent with a state that acts to benefits its legal residents, that treats them in a transparent way, that seeks to foster trust between it and them, and that seeks their voluntary compliance.\n\nThird, the above construal of reconciliation can account for the Court's notion that certain fundamental democratic values are a part of it (which are not entailed solely by the concept of rule of law). Democracy is a type of state with a fair distribution of political power, well captured by the norm that those who are subject to laws have an equal  opportunity  to  influence  their  adoption.  It  is  fairly  common among democratic theorists, from John Stuart Mill 41  onwards, to think that democratic governments are more likely than autocratic ones to adopt  laws  that  will  benefit  the  citizenry.  In  addition,  the  more democratic  a  state,  the  more  free  and  informed  the  collective decision-making process is.\n\nFourth,  and  finally,  recall  that  the  Court  includes  among  the elements of reconciliation the idea that offenders help to rebuild the society they were responsible for helping to break apart. Remember that this condition seems distinct from the first three; however, in light of the ubuntu -based conception of reconciliation above, it can be  seen  to  have  its  proper  place  alongside  them.  Part  of  what community ideally involves, for an African philosophy, is a condition in which people are working to help one another. And truly valuing mutual  aid  would  mean  that  those  who  have  worked  against  this condition in the past take extra measure to realise it in the future.\n\nSo far, I have argued that the various features of reconciliation that the Court appeals to in Du Toit , which appear to be a grab bag in that judgment, can be unified under a single, attractive heading of behaviourally prizing community qua the combination of identity and solidarity in the context of disavowing serious wrongdoing. As I show in  the  next  section,  however,  an ubuntu -based  conception  of reconciliation includes more elements than what the Court discusses, and these extra facets of reconciliation help to facilitate a firmer, more  principled  foundation  for  the  sort  of  amnesty  the  Court conceives as just.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n41 JS Mill Considerations on representative government (1861).\n\n## 4.2 Ubuntu -based reconciliation and a truth-oriented amnesty\n\nThe conception of national reconciliation grounded in the philosophical interpretation of ubuntu that I have proffered provides strong reason to believe that only a truth-oriented amnesty would be appropriate.  Note  that  reconciliation  is  conceived  as  one  that includes social interaction that is by and large informed . Community, of the ideal sort, consists of a relationship between people that is (among other things) transparent. In order to genuinely share a way of life with others, one needs to know the way that they have treated you, and the decision to engage with them must be consequent to that awareness. Hence, national reconciliation of the kind advocated here would  be  impossible  without  a  substantial  disclosure  of  political crimes undertaken in the past. Put roughly, blacks and whites could not  reconcile  in  the  sense  of  truly  living  together,  as  opposed  to merely inhabiting space and enjoying legal rights nearby one another, without an accurate awareness of what had transpired between them.\n\nConsider, now, how this argument for a truth-oriented amnesty improves  on  the  one  that  the  Court  gives.  The  Court's  reasoning, recall,  was  premised  on  the  ideas  that  reconciliation,  roughly conceived  as  peace,  the  rule  of  law  and  democratic  procedures, would be achieved only upon victims feeling substantial solace and closure,  something  they  could  experience  only  upon  substantial awareness of truth about the past. This argument relies on contested empirical contingencies about people's psychological reactions and resulting  behaviours.  In  contrast,  the  present  rationale  for  the desirability of a truth-oriented amnesty does not, instead pointing out that  truth  is  partially constitutive (as  opposed  to effective )  of reconciliation, conceived as a kind of communal or friendly relationship.\n\nNote  some  implications  of  this ubuntu -based  argument  for  the disclosure of political crimes. For one, it underwrites the widespread call  for  a  TRC  that  did  not  address  merely  the  worst  human rights violations that individuals suffered. Truly sharing a way of life would have also required spreading the truth about collective wrongs done to  black  people,  such  as  inferior  education,  exploitive  mining  and forced relocations. For another, it explains the common claim that reconciliation has not been achieved in South Africa. If the Court's understanding of reconciliation were correct, that claim would make no sense, for peace, democratic procedures, rule of law and the like have indeed been advanced. However, if reconciliation is something more,  including  elements  such  as  interacting  on  a  substantially informed basis and engaging in mutual aid in a way that transcends\n\nracial categories, then reconciliation is sensibly deemed to be an ongoing process in South Africa.\n\nFurthermore, the present argument employs a different strategy to  avoid  the  troublesome  implication  noted  in  section  2,  that  the more truth an amnesty should produce, the more reason there is to relieve the guilty of burdens they might face upon revealing it, and hence to give Du Toit his job back. The natural way for the Court to deal with this problem, recall, was to suggest that relieving too many burdens on the guilty would fail to produce solace and closure, the point  of  seeking  out  truth.  That  reasoning,  again,  relies  on  highly contestable empirical claims. In the following, I sketch an alternative resolution of the conundrum.\n\n## 4.3 Ubuntu -based reconciliation and an amnesty that does not favour the guilty\n\nFrom  the perspective of an ubuntu -inspired understanding of reconciliation, there are several reasons for the Court not to prohibit non-judicial  institutions  from  firing  someone  who  has  received amnesty for serious political crimes, even supposing that so prohibiting would result in greater disclosure from offenders. Truth about the past is one value essential to reconciliation, but it is only one, and it must be traded off to some degree for the sake of its other elements.\n\nFirst, then, there is the value of interaction among citizens that is free , and not merely informed. Suppose that if the state forbade organisations  from  firing  those  convicted  of  political  crimes,  more truth about the past would emerge. Even so, the benefit of disclosure would come at the cost of a restriction, and one placed on innocent employers. Another aspect of genuinely sharing a way of life means having the liberty to choose the terms of interaction, particularly with those who have done a grievous injustice to you or to those with whom you  identify.  An  institutional  agent  is  not  truly  reconciled  with someone who has committed political crimes if the Court forces it to continue to associate with him, when it otherwise would elect not to. Of  course,  refusing  to  reinstate  someone  discharged  for  having committed  a  crime  is  hardly  a  way  to  reconcile  with  him,  but  an employer would have a greater opportunity to forge real ties were the space of the job opened up for a new employee, one with whom the employer could identify and engage in solidarity to a much greater extent.\n\nSecond, there is the value of interaction between residents that is based on trust , rather than suspicion, fear or some other modus vivendi . The reality is that, upon hearing that high-ranking and visible\n\ncurrent  members  of  the  police  force  have  been  convicted  of murder -as residents should , given the need for informed interaction - their faith in the criminal justice system would likely decline.  Concretely,  how  is  a  population  realistically  supposed  to trust a police officer who has admitted to unjustifiably killing four people? 42 Note that the distrust would appear likely to obtain, even if the police force were to tell the public it thinks that it is justified in reinstating a convicted murderer.\n\nOn a related matter, third, a person's having been convicted of political crimes might give an institution such as the police force good reason to suspect he is not particularly well qualified to remain a part of it. Beyond exhibiting the kind of temperament that is not conducive to  protecting  the  innocent  and  more  generally  upholding  human rights, the bare fact that the populace is less likely to trust him would reasonably count as a serious disqualification. Hence, if community in the relevant sense includes the idea of people doing is what likely to help others, and particularly in the form of mutual aid , remaining on the police force would probably not be a way for Du Toit to do that.\n\nFourth,  and  finally,  there  is  that  part  of  reconciliation  that involves  public  institutions disavowing seriously  unjust  behaviour. Supposing that granting amnesty from criminal and civil liability were necessary in order to obtain substantial disclosure about apartheidera  crimes,  the  state  should  do  no  more  for  the  guilty  than  is necessary  for  that,  lest  it  fail  to  express  the  requisite  negative judgment and attitude toward what they have done. When serious injustice  has  been  committed,  it  is  important  for  victims  to  be acknowledged.  Ideally, that should  be  done  by  the  offenders themselves, with an apology and restitution. However, at least when that is absent, the political community has these duties: to listen to how victims were affected; to say that this was not how they should have been treated and that their dignity entitled them to better; to go out of its way to help them rebuild their lives; and, above all, not to impose any more burdens on them in a way that would benefit their oppressors,  such  as  forcing  them  to  interact  with  someone  in authority who is an apartheid-era killer.\n\nBefore concluding, I respond to a likely objection to this argument for  denying  Du  Toit  his  job,  and  then  bring  out  how  this  rationale improves on that provided by the Court. As for the objection, many will be tempted to suggest that an ubuntu ethic would recommend\n\n42 A plain reading here suggests an empirical claim about the effects of truth about political crimes on people's inclinations to trust the criminals. If the evidence for that  were  questionable,  I  could  move  to  a  more  principled  claim  about  when residents  would  have good  reason to  be  distrusting,  as  opposed  to  when  they would be likely to be distrusting.\n\nthat the police force, as well as residents, forgive Du Toit. Supposing that were correct, would it not tell against the alleged ubuntu -based ideals of disavowal of injustice and of giving employers the freedom to disassociate from convicted murderers?\n\nThe  objection  raises  some  thorny  issues  about  the  nature  of forgiveness and what it properly involves. However, I can say at least the following in reply. First, there need not be inconsistency between disavowal  of  a  political  crime  and  forgiveness  for  it,  at  least  over time. To forgive injustice without first disavowing it would, for many, be an inappropriate form of forgiveness. Distance is needed before reintegration becomes morally attractive, for a variety of reasons, ranging from giving offenders incentive to make up for harm they have done, to giving victims their due, as explained above.\n\nSecond, even assuming, for the sake of argument, that ubuntu would recommend that citizens and the police force forgive Du Toit immediately, it  would  not  follow  that  the  Court  may  rightly force them to do so or to act as though they have. The legal issue at stake is  whether  the  Court  may  legally prohibit non-judicial  institutions from  discharging  someone  who  has  received  amnesty  for  serious political crimes. The issue of when coercion may be used against an agent differs from the issue of what the agent is morally obligated to do,  with  not  every  moral  obligation  being  rightly  enforceable, according to common sense and moral principle. Hence, even if the police  force  and  citizens  were  failing  to  do  what  they  ought  in continuing  to  resent  Du  Toit,  it  would  not  obviously  follow  from ubuntu that the Court may intervene.\n\nNow compare the present argument for the conclusion in Du Toit with the Court's. The Court argues that reconciliation, qua peace, rule of law, etc, would be much less likely to result if were offenders were  given  the  'lion's  share  of  the  benefits'.  That  argument,  I contended, rests on an empirical claim that is far from obvious. In addition, I pointed out that, for all the Court says, there is just as much reason to 'level up' and force the SAPS to reinstate Du Toit, so long as the government provided equalising benefits to victims. The ubuntu -based  rationale  is  more  principled  and  less  vulnerable  to empirical contingency, and also provides a more intuitive reason not to require the police force to rehire Du Toit. It does not really invoke the idea that burdens  must  be  'balanced' so that 'to  grant disproportionate  benefit  to  one  party  at  the  expense  of  the  other would be unjust and would strike at the equilibrium envisaged by the Constitution'. 43   I  have not appealed to any notion that victims and offenders must be comparably burdened for the sake of some sort of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nequilibrium. If anything, I have suggested, among other things, that, in  order  for  the  state  to  distance  itself  from  what  offenders  have done, it  must  do  all  it  can  to  refrain  from  burdening  victims,  and should rather allow institutions to fire offenders. Since the notion of balancing or equilibrium is not involved, there is no concern about levelling up rather than down.\n\nNow, the Court could also invoke the claim I made above that there  is  good  reason  to  doubt  that  someone  convicted  of  political crimes would make for a well-qualified police officer, or at least one with a high status, and hence the Court could plausibly suggest that levelling  up  is  not  an  apt  way  to  enable  Du  Toit  to  contribute  to society.  However,  the  balancing  rationale  on  which  this  argument ultimately  rests  is  implausible,  at  least  in  comparison  with  the ubuntu -based argument. Instead of the view that burdens must be balanced as a means to achieve a reconciled society qua one that is peaceful,  democratic,  based  on  the  rule  of  law,  etc,  it  is  more attractive to argue that reconciliation itself includes the idea of the state expressing concern for victims along with doing what is likely to make victims  and  offenders  interact  on  the  basis  of  transparency, voluntariness, trust and mutual aid.\n\n## 5 Conclusion: Further applications\n\nI close this article by applying the ubuntu -based rationale for a truthoriented  amnesty  that  minimises  benefit  to  the  guilty  to  two additional Constitutional Court cases. One is the (currently) continuing case of McBride , 44  in which the Court must decide whether a newspaper was guilty of defamation for calling Robert McBride, who had received amnesty for political killings of innocents, a 'murderer', given  section  20(10)  of  the  Reconciliation  Act,  which  says  that amnesty implies that such actions 'shall for all purposes, including the application of any Act of Parliament or any other law, be deemed not to have taken place…'. The Supreme Court of Appeal ruled in favour of McBride, claiming that part of the Reconciliation Act's purpose was to  ensure  that  apartheid-era  offenders  'could  be  reintegrated  into society' 45  and that they would have been much less likely to disclose their political crimes if they 'could never ever rid themselves of the stigma  and  moral  opprobrium  of  their  deeds'. 46 Since  calling  an apartheid-era killer a 'murderer' would have frustrated the aims of reintegration and truth-telling, so the argument went, the Supreme Court  concluded  that  the  newspaper  was  wrong  to  do  so.  The\n\n- 44 See n 4 above.\n- 45 The Citizen v McBride [2010] ZASCA 5; 2010 4 SA 148 (SCA) ; [2010] 3 All SA 46\n- (SCA) para 30. 46 Citizen (n 45 above) para 91.\n\nConstitutional Court is now deciding whether the Supreme Court ruled correctly.\n\nThe above ubuntu -based conception of reconciliation entails that the Constitutional Court should overturn the Supreme  Court's decision. First, the latter rests on the dubious empirical claim that offenders would not have made substantial disclosures about political crimes  had  they  still  faced  the  prospect  of  people  giving  them unflattering labels. Strong reason to doubt this claim is that offenders would have faced criminal and civil prosecution had they not agreed to exchange truth for amnesty. Surely, the threat of prosecution was likely to have been sufficient to prompt offenders to robustly reveal their misdeeds.\n\nSecond, as has often been suggested, it would be counter to an interest in fostering truth about the past to forbid a newspaper, and others  in  society,  from  naming  someone  who  culpably  committed unjustified killings of innocent people a 'murderer'.\n\nThird,  as  noted  above,  truth  is  one  part  of  reconciliation,  but there are several other facets of it that entail that it would be wrong to pursue maximal disclosure from offenders by means of relieving them of more than judicial burdens. Specifically, recall the idea that part of reconciliation involves major segments of society disavowing seriously unjust behaviour. To reconcile, in the way ubuntu recommends,  is  to  acknowledge  when  people  have  wrongfully dishonoured communal relationships.\n\nThis  point  is  relevant  to  the  other  purpose  the  Supreme  Court mentions, that of reintegrating the offender. When reintegration is understood along the lines of ubuntu , as suggested above, one sees that it would actually be promoted upon the moralised judgment of offenders. An Afro-communal conception of reconciliation, recall, is the idea of residents by and large disavowing serious injustice that had taken place and interacting on a substantially voluntary, informed and  trustworthy  basis  for  the  sake  of  shareable  ends  that  involve mutual  aid.  Since  disavowal  is  central  to  reconciliation,  properly understood,  it  actually  requires  going  beyond  merely  'neutral' descriptions  when  characterising  past  misdeeds.  Indeed,  it  entails that offenders themselves ought to be willing to take responsibility for their political crimes and be willing to judge themselves as having done  wrong.  And  reconciliation,  insofar  as  it  involves  voluntary interaction, would be pro tanto hindered were the press and others in society legally muzzled from naming people the way they see fit to name them, particularly when such names are accurate.\n\nFinally,  and  more  quickly,  I  apply  the  logic  of  the  rationale proffered in this article to the case of Albutt v the Centre for the\n\nStudy of Violence and Reconciliation and Others . 47 The issue, here, is whether the President of South Africa was required to take victim impact  statements  into  consideration  upon  deciding  whether  to pardon those who had not received amnesty for political crimes and had been convicted for them. The President was disinclined to do so, and  several  victims'-rights  organisations  sued,  citing,  among  other things,  irrationality  in  that  disposition,  given  the  President's  own intention to uphold the Reconciliation Act. The Constitutional Court unanimously  ruled  in  favour  of  the  victims,  claiming  that  the 'objectives of national unity and national reconciliation, require, as a matter of rationality, that the victims must be given the opportunity to  be  heard  in  order  to  determine  the  facts  on  which  pardons  are based.' 48\n\nThe ubuntu -based conception of reconciliation naturally supports the  Court's  judgment  that  reconciliation  includes  not  only  victims receiving 'public recognition that they had been wronged,' 49 but also the widespread revelation of truth about past misdeeds. 50 Reconciliation, understood as (partially) comprised of public disavowal of injustice and social interaction based on an informed understanding of history, provides strong reason for a President to listen  to  the  ways  victims  were  wronged  by  those  convicted  of political  crimes,  before  making  a  decision  about  whether  to  the pardon  the  latter.  Hence,  the  moral  philosophy  articulated  and applied  to  the  issue  of  reconciliation  in  this  article  provides  the resources to justify two of the Constitutional Court's recent judgments and indicates how  it ought to resolve a further, outstanding one. The appeal to moral philosophy facilitates unity in law.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 47 Albutt v the Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation &amp; Others [2010] ZACC 4; 2010 3 SA 293 (CC); 2010 (5) BCLR 391 (CC).\n- 49\n- 48 Albutt (n 47 above) 37.\n- Albutt (n 47 above) 32, citing The Truth and Reconciliation Commission Truth and reconciliation commission report, volume 1 (1998) 128.\n- 50 Albutt (n 47 above) 31 34.",
