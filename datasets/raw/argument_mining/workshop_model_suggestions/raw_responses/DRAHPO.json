    "user_content": "## HEGEL'S PHILOSOPHY OF LOGIC AS A RECKLESS PROLONGATION OF CUSANUS' LOGICAL DISCOVERIES\n\nAbstract. I take advantage of two recent results: 1) the recognition of an alternative theoretical organization to  the  deductive-axiomatic  one;  it  is  characterized  by  a  sequence  of  four  logical  steps  belonging  to intuitionist logic; 2) the recognition of the logical content of Cusanus' philosophical works; also this content pertains  to  intuitionist  logic,  which  Cusanus  anticipated  by  even  identifying  some  its  logical  laws.  Many Cusanus' books present the alternative theoretical organization; whose yet he did not apply in a clear way its last  two steps,  the ad absurdum arguing and the application of the principle of sufficient reason. For this reason in the last books his thinking transcended to a metaphysical level. Hegel's philosophy of logic shares Cusanus'  philosophical  effort  for  exiting  out  classical  logic.  He  seems  to  have  assumed  Cusanus' anticipation  of  the  new  theoretical  organization;  all  goes  as  if  Hegel  wanted  to  improve  Cusanus'  poor method,  by  introducing  a  process  of  additions  of  two  negations  which  however  does  not  agree  with  the intuitionist  logic.  Moreover,  Hegel  presupposes, like Cusanus  in  his last  years, the free application  of  the principle of sufficient reason to the entire subject of his philosophy of logic without awareness of the logical constraints to which is subject a correct application of this principle; hence, he introduced a metaphysical arguing which according to modern mathematical logic has no consistent content. Also Hegel's supposed prolongation of Cusanus' logical discoveries was an essentially metaphysical view.\n\nKeywords :  Cusanus,  intuitionist  logic,  doubly  negated  propositions, ad  absurdum reasoning,  principle  of sufficient reason, Hegel's philosophy of logic.\n\n## 1. Introduction: Hegel well knew previous Cusanus' logical search\n\nIn the literature on the relationship Hegel-Cusanus there exists an agreement on three points: 1) contrarily to a common attitude of past scholars of Nicolas Cusanus (1401-1464), his thinking cannot  be  interpreted  through  Hegel's  philosophy  (Gabriel  1970);  Hegel  suggested  a  different theory  which  is  not  compatible  with  Cusanus';  2)  Hegel's  writings  lack  of  any  quotation  of Cusanus' antecedent philosophical work; 3) but his logical thinking is in a great consonance with Cusanus'. Indeed, in times dominated by classical logic both wanted to exit out it in order to build an alternative kind of logic. On his hand, Cusanus wanted to found a different theology from both the affirmative one and the negative one and hence from Aristotelian logic; this is the same logic that Hegel denied as static and abstract in order to build a logic of historical and dynamical nature, in sum in order to perform 'a total makeover' of past logic (Hegel 1813, 'Introduction'; see also the 'Introduction' to the II ed.). Both attempts for a new logic started from the reflection on the contradiction  principle;  they  reduced  its  role  to  a  lateral  one,  for  giving  birth  to  new  logical principles, first of all the principle of 'the contradiction of the opposites', which apparently clashes with the basic principles of classical logic.\n\nHence, no surprise if many recent studies gave evidence that through the books that Hegel surely read and meditated he well knew Cusanus and was even familiar with his ideas. A scholar wrote:\n\nNo direct connection has ever been established between Nicholas of Cusa and Hegel. It has been accepted  that  Hegel  did  not  know  of  him.  In  fact,  there  is  clear  evidence  that  Hegel  knew  of Cusanus, and in  detail .  Not  only  did  Bruno twice specifically refer to him, and with the highest praise.  Buhle,  whose  history  Hegel  read,  discussed  Cusanus  at  length,  citing  all  of  his  most important works.\n\nIn the first volume of his Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion Hegel quoted Eckhart from one of his sermons - 'The eye with which God sees me is the eye with which I see him.'\" In volume III of his Lectures on the History of Philosophy Hegel discussed Bohme - 'the first German philosopher' the  reading  of  whose  works  was  'wondrous,'  over  eleven  pages,  giving  five  pages  in  the  same volume to Bruno, yet he never even mentioned Cusanus - a figure in the German mystical tradition between Eckhart and Bohme.\n\nBut the 'divine' Cusanus who Bruno named ,  'the inventor of geometry's most beautiful secrets,' is Bruno's guide in Cause, Principle and Unity , in which Bruno referred to key aspects of Cusanus'\n\nphilosophy. Bruno again named and referred to Cusanus as 'divine' in The Ash Wednesday Supper , citing his single most important treatise, De Docta lgnorantia .\n\nParticularly, in the same volume of his Lectures on the History of Philosophy , Hegel wrote simply of Bruno 'The tidiest information about him is to be found in Buhle's history of philosophy. In that extremely interesting work (not only because of the sections on Cusanus but because in it Buhle discusses  the  impact  of  Neoplatonism,  Kabbalism  and  Hermeticism  in  general  on  German philosophy) Buhle wrote on Cusanus in detail, naming his most significant treatises.\n\nWhy  did  Hegel  never  even  name  Cusanus,  in  any  of  his  writing  -  a  man  who  was  far  more philosophical, and in the 'Hegelian manner,' than either Eckhart and particularly Boehme, of whom Hegel  also  wrote  that  his  articulation  was  'unmistakably  barbarous'  and  that  he  'grasps  the antitheses in the harshest' crudest fashion\"?'\n\nMy contention in my thesis will be that Hegel never named Cusanus, not only because he was so indebted to one who was known to be a Christian mystic/Neoplatonist (I have identified more than thirty  points  in  the  philosophy  of  Cusanus  which  occur  in  that  of  Hegel),  but  because  to  do  so would immediately open to question the nature of Hegel's vaunted concepts (several of  which, I will contend, came directly from Cusanus), the apparent intellectual rigour of his philosophy, and particularly, the meaning of his 'reason' - his claims to and for it.\n\nIn denying through his utter silence the significance of Cusanus and the foresight of his genius, Hegel was emblematic not only of the German intellectuals of his time […] but of Western culture as a whole - suppressing key elements of our history, of what has made us, so that we may perceive ourselves, as Hegel did, the bearers and masters of 'Reason.' (Stanfield 2020)\n\nAbstract. In  this  extract  from  my  thesis  I  argue  that  Hegel  not  only  knew  of  Cusanus  but  was familiar  with  his  ideas  and  that  he  never  even  named  him  because  of  the  implications  of  that acknowledgement  indebtedness  to  Cusanus,  the  certainty  of  his  own  Neoplatonism  and  for  his ambition. Hegel was by no means the only philosopher in his time and later to fail to acknowledge those  who  significantly  influenced  them  (particularly  Neoplatonic  and  mystical  writers).  This,  in effect, denial of the significance of Neoplatonism and mysticism is representative of the pandering of Western  academic  philosophers  to  patriarchal  and  supremacist  notions  of  what  comprises  'reason'. [Instead,] It was the fruits of Neoplatonism (particularly via Cusanus and then Descartes) that enabled Western philosophy to be broken from scholasticism and advanced…\n\nNothing could more exemplify the dishonesty that permeates modern Western philosophy, a dishonesty motivated by a careerist pandering to the requirements of the dominant ideology, than the relationship between  Neoplatonism  and  the  Philosophy  of  the  German  idealists,  particularly  Hegel. […]  Hegel showed clear features of the type of thought found in the Platonism of late antique philosophers like Plotinus  and  Proclus  (Beierwaltes  2004;  Vieillard-Baron  1979)....  The  neoplatonistic  thought  of Plotinus and Proclus had been a recurring feature of German religious and philosophical thought since the late middle ages, having appeared in influential thinkers like Meister Eckhart and Nicholas of Cusa and later, Leibniz and Jacob Böhme. (Stanfield 2017; emphasis added by A.D.))\n\nIn the following three sections I will present the preliminaries for interpreting the supposed connection between Cusanus and Hegel, which will be illustrated by going beyond the lack of any Hegel's  reference  to  this  antecedent  philosopher.  These  preliminaries  have  been  established  by some  recent  papers  (Drago  2012;  Drago  2017a).  In  sect.  2  I  list  a  series  of  doubly  negated propositions which occur as fundamental propositions within some scientific theories. They belong to intuitionist logic; as a consequence, these theories are organized according to a model of theory different  from  both  (apodictic)  Aristotelian,  deductive  one  and  its  improvement  into  Hilbert's axiomatic one; their theoretical organizations are problem-based because each of them is aimed to discover a new scientific method by solving a given basic problem. In sect. 3 the four logical steps of a problem-based theory are listed and illustrated. Sect. 4 applies this kind of logic and this new theoretical model to Cusanus' philosophical works. Some books written by Cusanus in his last years (1460-1464) play a decisive role for manifesting a logical attitude that anticipated even some laws of  intuitionist  logic;  but  he  was  unaware  of  the  general  logical  system  and  in  particular  of  the correct way of arguing through ad absurdum arguments; so that at the end of his life he searched new  improvements  of  his  thinking  in  a  purely  metaphysical  way.  Sect.  5  compares  the  best advancements of Cusanus' philosophy with Hegel's philosophy of logic. I suggest that all went as if Hegel  wanted  to  improve  Cusanus'  logical  advancements,  mainly  the  use  of  doubly  negated propositions by inventing a syllogism-like process of reasoning (addition of two negations) which instead  misunderstands  the  relations  among  the  three  versions  (affirmative,  negative,  doubly negated)  of  a  same  proposition  in  intuitionist  logic.  As  a  fact,  Hegel's  dialectic  is  a  deviant beginning of a non-Aristotelian logic which later will be formally recognized in the intuitionist one. Hence, Hegel developed a metaphysical thinking without a logical consistency.\n\n## 2. Doubly negated propositions in scientific theories\n\nIn ancient Greece the art of reasoning was in a first time a pluralist one. Ancient Greek word for truth: un-veiling. The ancient Greek word for truth was 'ἀλήθεια (alétheia)' which is composed by  a  privative  ἀ  and  λήθω  (to  be  hidden);  hence,  un-veiling,  i.e.  a  double  negation  without  an equivalent affirmative word, since it means a process, not a fixed idea. In this sense 'Alétheia' is in opposition  to  the  Latin  word  'Veritas',  i.e.  the  present  common  meaning  of  truth.  The  original meaning of 'Alétheia' was then changed (maybe by Plato) into an abstract, eternal entity which to believe  in  (in  Italian  language  wedding  ring  is  called  'vera',  the  feminine  of  'vero',  true). Afterwards,  Aristotle  improved  classical  logic  till  up  to  perform  mechanical  implications,  as  it occurs in syllogistic. Along a period of two millennia Aristotle's formalization of logic persisted without relevant changes, apart the birth of a modal logic which however never  achieved  a selfconsistency.  During  this  period  logic  was  mainly  considered  as  an  instrument,  not  as  a  theory deserving attention by itself. Owing to its precious formal mechanisms, classical logic was assumed as the most productive one. Therefore, it was so greatly developed that in next centuries Western culture considered classical logic in an exclusive way (this was e.g. Kant's prejudice).\n\nYet, scientific theories a different kind of fundamental propositions; they have the specific features  that  are  doubly  negated  propositions,  whose  corresponding  affirmative  ones  lack  of evidence (DNPs) 1 ; hence for each of them the classical law of double negation (commonly said as 'Two negations affirm') fails, just as in the non-classical kinds of logic, first of all the intuitionist logic 2 . Let us consider the following list of this kind of propositions.\n\nBy means of the principle \"All substances that we could not decompose in any way are for us elements\" Lavoisier has given rise to the chemical theory (1789, 'Discours préliminaire', p. 7). Manifestly, previous proposition is a methodological principle giving to a theory a stable viewpoint to its investigations. Later, Mendeleev eventually acquired a proper way of completing the theory through his periodic table, just by reasoning through DNPs, in particular the word 'equivalent' (= not  different)  for  representing  the  relations  between  two  elements  under  a  chemical  aspect  or  a physical one.\n\nIn economy, the basic principle is the following one: 'No free [= without money] lunch'.\n\nThe traditional theory of mechanics begins with the principle of inertia; this principle was enunciated by Lazare Carnot in a different manner from Newton's: 'Once a body is at rest, alone does not change its state; if it is in motion, alone does not change speed or direction.' (L. Carnot 1803, p. 49) By cancelling the two negations of L. Carnot's proposition we exactly obtain Newton's affirmative, yet idealistic word \"perseveres\", whereas L. Carnot's DNP is an operative proposition,\n\n1 Here we meet a prejudice pertaining to the Anglo-Saxon culture: the use of double negations is a characteristic feature of primitive languages and all such expressions constitute an un-frankly speaking (Horn 2002, pp. 79 ff.; Horn 2010). This  prejudice leads  to  cancel  the  double  negations  because  all  they  have  to  be  considered  equivalent  to  the corresponding affirmative expressions.\n\n2 In the following I will underline the two negative words inside a DNP in order to make easier to the reader the recognition of the nature of the proposition. The double negation cannot oppose to the affirmation because it represents an open situation; e.g. the proposition: 'Acquitted for insufficiency of evidence of guilty' does not means a correct behavior of the defendant nor his misconduct, but only the incapacity of the Court to sharply decide the author of the crime.\n\nbecause its words may be verified by an experimental physicist 3 . Moreover, Carnot' formulation of mechanics is aimed to discover the 'in-variants' of the impact of bodies. (L. Carnot 1783)\n\nSadi Carnot's thermodynamics may be summarized by the proposition: 'It is not true that heat is not equal to work' that of course does not means 'Heat is equal to work'. Its basic principle was: 'No change of temperature inside the bodies employed for obtaining the motrice power of heat occurs without a change in the volume'. (S. Carnot 1924, p. 23)\n\nIn Lobachevsky  booklet introducing the first non-Euclidean geometry, after fifteen preliminary  propositions,  the  proposition  no.  16  put  the  problem  of  how  many  are  the  parallels lines; 'in the uncertainty' (Lobachevsky 1840), i.e. '… in the ignorance whether the parallel lines are  not  reduced  to  only  one…' he  decides  to  explore  the  case  of  two  parallels  lines.  First,  he suggests a new, more general definition of parallelism; then he states two theorems corroborating his  definition  and  then  he  proves  four  theorems  whose  general  conclusion  is  the  following proposition:  \"The  second  assumption  [of  two  parallel  lines]  can  likewise  be  admitted  without leading to any contradiction in the results...\" This proposition is a DNP since it is not equivalent to: 'The  second  assumption  is  consistent',  i.e.  'There  exist  two  parallel  lines';  which  actually Lobachevsky  never  stated.  The  doubly  negated  proposition  represents  a  surmise  allowing  to correctly reasoning for proving the existence of two parallel lines.\n\nAccording  to  Andrey  Kolmogorov  the  basic  principle  of  intuitionist  logic  is:  'Any [affirmative]  proposition  that  is  not  without  content  should  refer  to  one  or  more  completely determined  states  of  affairs  accessible  to  our  experience.'  (Kolmogorov  1932,  p.  332)  This proposition  is  not  equivalent  to  the  following  one  'All  intuitionist  affirmative  propositions  are supported by full evidence', because we cannot control all these propositions.\n\nIn sum, there exist logically different principles from the affirmative ones; in logical terms they are DNPs.\n\nPrevious investigations on the occurrences of DNPs within original scientific texts suggested the following main rules for recognizing them.\n\nFirst of all, three cases of doubly negated propositions have to be discarded because they not are DNPs:\n\n- a )  a  doubly  negated  proposition  which  is  a  merely  rhetoric  one,  because  a  verification  of  its correspondence  with  reality  makes  apparent  that  it  concerns  an  objective  fact;  in  such  a  case  the proposition belongs to classical logic; e.g. 'This move does not lead to you out of the room'.\n- b ) a doubly negated proposition which is equivalent to a negated proposition whose negation is emphasised, i.e. one negation of the former proposition reinforces in a psychological way the other one; e.g. the already quoted propositions 'I cannot go no further'; 'I cannot get no satisfaction'.\n- c ) a doubly negated proposition where a negation explains the other one, e.g. 'I have no answer from this deaf (wo)man' (actually this proposition is a shortened version of two propositions: 'I have no answer from this (wo)man because (s)he is deaf').\n\nInstead, a doubly negated proposition is a genuine DNP when it includes:\n\n- 1) A single word may be composed by two negations; e.g. in-nocent (≠ righteous).\n- 2) The word 'only', being equivalent to 'nothing else', works as a DNP.\n- 3) Modal words 'must', 'possible', 'necessary', etc. work as DNPs, owing to the S4 translation between modal logic and intuitionist logic. (Hughes, Cresswell 1996, pp. 224ff.). These words will be dotted underlined.\n3. From the DNPs the discovery of an alternative model of theoretical organization to the axiomatic one. The four logical steps of problem-based organization of a theory\n\n3 In addition notice that here we are talking about \"a\" well established body, not, as Newton says, 'all' bodies, whose experimental evidence is inattainable.\n\nIn the past, owing to the inaccuracy in circumscribing its contents, a DNP was considered as a blind alley for understanding the reality, or at most as the characteristic feature of a mysticism (see e.g. a common interpretation of Cusanus' writings). From all in the above instead one draws that a DNP constitutes the mark of the non-classical rationality; and it is the base of an alternative way of reasoning.\n\nAlong  two  millennia  a  clear  presentation  of  a  scientific  theory  required  a  systematic organization  of  a  deductive  kind  starting  from  few  axioms.  But  this  kind  of  organization  cannot include  a  DNP.  Indeed,  a  DNP  cannot  play  the  role  of  an  axiom,  because  its  content  cannot  be stated with certainty (it corresponds to an open set in Stone representation of intuitionist logic; it states a(n imprecise) bound to our inaccurate thinking). In logical terms, being the content of ¬¬ A different  from  the  content  of A, no  affirmative  proposition  can  be  derived  from  it . On  the  other hand, an axiom, being expressed by an affirmative proposition which is equivalent to its doubly negated proposition, cannot produce by logical implication a DNP, which is not equivalent to its corresponding affirmative proposition. Hence, the classical consequences of an affirmative axiom are propositions of only classical, never a DNP pertaining to a non-classical logic. In sum, even the occurrence in a theory of a single DNP prevents a deductive organization of this theory.\n\nSo  no  theoretical  organization  through  DNPs?  Most  scholars  seem  to  have  this  opinion about  what  they  call  the  'negative'  thinking.  Instead,  a  comparative  analysis  on  the  texts  of  the above-mentioned  theories  shows  the  well-defined  characteristic  features  of  a  common  model  of theoretical organization.\n\n- i\n- ) Each of these theories presupposes no more than the common knowledge about the field at issue.\n- ii ) It states a problem which is unsolvable through usual tools. Lavoisier's chemistry: what are the elements of the matter? Lazare Carnot's mechanics: what are the invariants in an impact of bodies?\n- S.  Carnot's  thermodynamics:  what  is  the  maximum  efficiency  of  heat/work  transformations? Lobachevsky's  geometry:  How  many  parallel  lines  exist?  Kolmogorov's  above-mentioned  paper formalizing intuitionist logic: how formalize in logical terms a calculus of mathematical problems? iii ) It is aimed at inventing a new method for solving the previously given problem.\n- iv ) In order to solve the given problem the author of the theory argues by linking together the DNPs through words as 'otherwise we obtain an absurd result' an ad absurdum argument (AAA) 4 . This DNP may work as a premise for a next AAA; hence, many AAAs may constitute a chain of AAAs.\n- v )  The  final  AAA  concludes  a  DNP  suggesting  a  universal  predicate,  ¬¬ UT ,  which  represents  a possible  resolution  for  all  cases  of  the  starting  problem  and  the  related  problems.  Hence,  the conclusion of the final AAA suggests a surmise; but being a DNP, it cannot be accurately tested with reality.\n\nv ) At this point, an author of such a theory as a matter of fact performs the step called PSR, i.e. he translates  the  above  predicate ¬¬ UT into  the  corresponding  affirmative  predicate UT 5 .  One  can suppose  that  the  author  thinks  to  have  already  collected  enough  evidence  to  be  justified  in promoting  his  conclusion  ¬¬ UT to  the  corresponding  affirmative  proposition UT ,  although  this change is not allowed by non-classical logic, which previously he adhered to.\n\n4 This AAA is of a weak kind, i.e. its final proposition is a DNP. Notice that a common opinion holds that an ad absurdum argument concludes an affirmative proposition; yet this conclusion is possible only if one applies to the conclusion of an AAA, i.e. a DNP, the double negation law, which however pertains to only classical logic.\n\n5 The logical step which in the above was denoted as PSR is explicitly manifested by three eminent scientists. Galilei (1958, p. 191), Lobachevsky (1840, prop. 22) and Einstein (1905b, p. 891).\n\nvi )  Now  he  draws  from  this  affirmative  proposition  all  possible  derivations,  to  be  subsequently tested against reality for a verification of the built theory. (Drago 2012) Hence, the application of PSR translates the conclusion of the AAAs into an affirmation whose derivations are tested with reality.  If  the  answers  that  he  obtains  are  positive,  what  was  a  hypothetical  reasoning  is  changed into a theory of reality. I conclude that there exists evidence of a scientific nature of the logical step PSR to the conclusion of (the sequence of DNPs and AAAs of) a PO theory.\n\nvii ) Let us examine this step, PSR, in formal terms of the square of opposition. It corresponds to a change of the main thesis  A  ('S  is  P')  from  its  non-classical  version  ('not  (S  is  not  P)')  to  the classical  one.  Through  Dummett's  table  of  all  implications  between  a  couple  of  classical  and intuitionist  predicate  (Dummett 1977, p. 29) it is apparent  that previous translation is enough for changing the entire intuitionist predicate logic into the classical one (indeed, the similar change of thesis  E  is  obtained  by  merely  negating  thesis  A;  the  change  of  thesis  I  is  obtained  by  doubly negating thesis A).\n\nThis step PSR apparently represents an application of Leibniz' principle of sufficient reason; its  antecedent  is  itself  a  universal  DNP  ('Nothing  is  without  reason')  and  the  consequent  is  the corresponding affirmative proposition ('Everything has a reason'). Through the step PSR an author of a problem-based theory performs on a specific predicate of this theory a logical translation which formally  is  the  same  translation  performed  by  the  application  of  this  general  principle,  i.e.  the logical translation occurring from the antecedent of Leibniz' principle of sufficient reason into its consequent:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nNotice  that  the  translation  performed  by  this  principle  merely  constitutes  the  inverse translation of the so-called 'negative translation' (i.e. a suitable addition of two negations to each classical proposition (Troelstra and van Dalen 1988, pp. 56 ff.). Yet, whereas the latter one can be always performed under some simple rules on the way to add the two negations, the application of PSR is valid, as suggested by Markov, under two requirements on the doubly negated predicate on which it  is  applied:  it  has  to  be  1)  derived  from  an  AAA  and  2)  decidable  (Markov  1961,  p.  5; Drago 2012) for the simple reason that for passing from a hypothetical world to a real world we have to be supported by reality criteria.\n\nLet us remark that the essential steps of a PO theory are the previous four: ii ), iii ), iv ), and vi ).\n\n## 4. The results of Cusanus's searching for a suitable name of God\n\nAt glance Cusanus' illustrations of his subjects seem an inextricable link of concepts devoid of  content.  A  scholar  went  to  write  that  Cusanus  presents  'une  jonglerie  de  mots'  ('a  word juggling') resulting into 'tours de passe passe' (turns of inconsistent connections; Duhem 1913, p. 262).  However,  a  more  accurate  reading  of  his  writings  shows  that  Cusanus  dramatized  an exhausting  search  looking  for  the  best  name  of  God.  From  the coincidentia  oppositorum of Maximum and Minimum in the book of 1440 ( De Docta Ignorantia 6 ), in 1460 he went to the name Posse = est ( Power=is ), shortened in Possest . Here his thinking relied on modal logic, determined by the word posse . Two years later he went to discover the (intuitionist) name Non Aliud (Not-Other) giving the title of a new book: De Non Aliud . It is remarkable that in this new book, by reasoning about theological subjects Cusanus anticipated some laws of intuitionist logic (of terms). He stated that  not-other  is  not  the  same  (Cusanus  1462,  chap.  5,  p.  1117,  no.  19;  p.  1164,  no.  123);  this distinction  between  the  double  negation  word  and  the  positive  word  represents  the  basic  law  of intuitionist logic. He stated also that 'the negation does not exists before the not-other.' (ibidem, chap. 4, p. 1113, no.11); this proposition affirms the validity of the doubly negated term whereas the negative term and the positive term are only partially true. Notice also his following proposition: 'Negation does not oppose to affirmation'.

(Cusanus  1441-1442,  I,  11,  no.  57,  p.  190)  The  word  'partakes'  summarizes  a  DNP  because  it  is equivalent to: 'It is not the case that it is not…'. However, Cusanus did not perceive this proposition as a DNP.\n\n(The  qualifications  'heuristic  theory'  and  'deductive-like  theory'  refer  to  the  respective final  summaries  of De  non  Aliud and De  Apice  Theoriae and  correspond  to  the  two  kinds  of theoretical organization, respectively PO and AO).\n\n## 5. How Cusanus may have paved the way to Hegel's philosophy of logic\n\nHere I suggest a more accurate periodization of Cusanus' books of the last period of his life (1460-1464).  According  to  Flasch's  periodization  the  contents  of  all  these  books  are  directed  as their natural conclusion, to the content of the last work ( De Apice theoriae ,  1464, the  year of his death) exactly as Cusanus presented it: the same title of this last book announces to have achieved the  ultimate  result  of  his  reflections.  Instead  Drago's  periodization  has  detailed  this  period  by distinguishing Cusanus' book based on modal logic ( Possest )  from his book based on intuitionist logic ( Non Aliud ). But he did not give reason of the occurrence of last four books. Apart De Ludo Globi (1463) (which illustrates through an odd kind of game Cusanus' conception of mechanics' dynamics and by analogy the soul), they are De Venatione Sapientiae ,  summarizing ten strategic paths for 'hunting' the wisdom (of approaching God), Compendium , summarizing the paths of his previous researches and for first time introducing the word Posse for  naming God, and De Apice Theoriae (1464) which is presented by him as the point of arrival of the research of his entire life (Cusanus 1464, p. 1424, 4).\n\nI suggest that the last two important books represent recoil of Cusanus' reflection from the method described by De non Aliud . The latter book was exalting in suggesting great novelties, but, beyond his first results, in the end it suggested a very different method of arguing from Cusanus' usual one; in other terms, the word not-other was impracticable by him for arguing further on both God and Tri-Unity.\n\nActually, he had already looked for discovering a better way of reasoning. In De Aequalitate (1459), although it was clear to him that Aristotle's syllogistic concerns classical logic, i.e. the kind of  logic  from  which  he  wanted  to  exit  out,  he  devoted  space  to  analyze  this  traditional  way  of formally reasoning. He attempted to suggest some novelties; but at last he did not obtain nothing of relevant for his aim of reasoning in a new way with respect to Aristotle's one.\n\nWe know that  according  to  a  PO  theory  Cusanus'  reflection  on De  Non  Aliud ought  to reason by composing through DNPs ad absurdum arguments; which really his book presents, but in an occasional circumstances and without noticing their importance. Since he had failed to discover a new way of reasoning, in the end the double negation of the exalting name Not-Other seemed to him a cul de sac of his research.\n\nRather, the previous method of modal logic in Possest appeared to him more productive than the latter one; since modal logic is more apt to argue through intuitive, linguistic turns of phrase according  to  his  reasoning  through  primitive  rules 9 ;  through  modal  words  he  could  space  on apparently  unlimited  horizons.  For  this  reason  in  his  last  works  Cusanus  came  back  to  arguing through modalities, as in the book Possest . Indeed, in De Apice Theoriae , although he suggested a number of AAAs, many of the following form 'Without…., nothing…', he persisted in arguing in an intuitive way on modal words, i.e. by combining the terms through daring connections.\n\nIn addition, according to the PO of his theory Cusanus had to conclude by applying PSR. He actually expressed the PSR in De Non Aliud , a first time in chap. IX: 'it is not the case that anything is created unreasonably'; and then in proposition 20 of its summary: 'Nothing is in vain' . In the former case he recognizes it as the Ground of the world, i.e. as a basic principle of reason. But he did not attribute to it a theoretical role, neither explicitly or implicitly, in his theories.\n\nIn particular, Cusanus does not apply the PSR to his main result of De Non Aliud ,  the  word non aliud ,  because  it  would  become idem and  his  intuitionist  logic  would  be  denied.  Instead,  he  had applied PSR in previous book Possest. We know that the name Posse=est represents an application\n\n9 An inspection of his way of arguing shows that his crucial words are the following ones: without greater thing, maximum and minimum , antecedent and consequent, cause, generate, depend, 'idempotence' (e.g. all of all, form of the form), etc.\n\nof PSR to the modal name Posse , which as a modality is equivalent to a doubly negated term ('It is not true that cannot…') and hence the result of the application of PSR ('it can') may be the term est 10 . The entire book depends from this application of PSR.\n\nBut he ignored that in order to avoid that the reasoning enters into a metaphysical realm the correct application of PSR to a predicate requires that it fulfills two constraints. Surely, he did not care  to  examine  if  his  predicates  are  decidable;  in  fact,  they  are  not.  Therefore,  in Possest he inadvertently  entered  into  a  metaphysical  realm  which  did  not  distinguish  the  reality  from  the idealistic concepts and beings. Through his free application of PSR Cusanus went to, according his words in De Visione Dei (1453), overcome the wall constituted by the coincidence of oppositorum , i.e. he entered into the Paradise.\n\nThe word Posse is a modal word, but Cusanus' attribution to God gives to it a metaphysical substance, so much to be considered by a believer in God as an objective word. In such a sense in last Cusanus' work, De Apice Theoriae , the word posse has two meanings: the original meaning of the modal word and an objectively demonstrated capacity to do, as it is attributed by a believer to God. In such a way this term alone, posse , joins in itself the two meanings which otherwise would be joined by only an application of PRS as he had did in previous book Possest . At last, the book is an entire metaphysical vision produced by the exalting last discovery of his life ( De Apice Theoriae , 5, pp. 1424-1425 and 14, pp. 1429).\n\nThis  transcendent  plan  of  arguing  now  concerns  first  of  the quidditas of  everything,  in particular God; hence, he does no more distinguishes between real world and transcendent world; the reality has joined metaphysics; and vice versa . In this vision God as Posse subsumes in Himself the entire world as His direct expression or prolongation. It seems that Cusanus perceived that this conclusion contradicts all what he had written in previous books, i.e. God is unattainable, because he introduces ( De Apice Theoriae ,  10-11, pp. 1427-1428) a correction, by distinguishing between 'to have the power to see' and 'to have the power to understand'; where only the last capacity of human beings is limited. However, each qualification of a subject or being is now of a qualitative nature, not of a quantitative nature.\n\nClearly the viewpoint of Cusanus' arguing is different in correspondence with the kind of logic applied by Cusanus and the kind of application of PSR. The book De non Aliud presents the viewpoint of a person searching the best name of God (even the first part of the complete title of the book states this viewpoint: ' Directio speculantis seu De non Aliud ',  i.e.  'Address  to a searching philosopher…).  Instead,  Cusanus'  application  of  the  PSR  to  the  word Posse ,  giving est without caring of the two constraints (the doubly negated term has to result from an ad absurdum argument and  decidable)  suggests  to  him  a  metaphysical  viewpoint  looking  for  the  true  nature  of  God,  a nature  which transcends all personal viewpoints.  In other words, Possest presents  a  transcendent viewpoint; no surprise if Cusanus performed without problems his investigation on this metaphysical plan, because he ignored to have missed a logical consistency.\n\nTwo years later he temporarily abandoned this viewpoint when discovered the intuitionist name 'Not-Other', which more adequately represented his personal research. But in Compendium (1463)  and  in De  Apice  Theoriae (1464)  Cusanus  renounced  to  the  personal  viewpoint  which appeared to him no more improvable beyond his previous use of the word not-other and chose to pursue his metaphysical view. He shortened the name Possest into the name Posse (or Posse ipsum ; which, without changing the logical nature of the name Posse , merely emphasizes it) and elaborated it  in  a  metaphysical way. At last, his trespassing in both Compendium and De Apice Theoriae to metaphysics , his viewpoint is clearly the same transcendent viewpoint obtained by naming through the application of the PSR God as Posse=est .\n\nIn the history of philosophy this Cusanus' result constitutes the birth of an absolute Spirit, although in a Christian version, since he identified Him with 'God trine and one', as he writes in\n\n10 By following classical logic Scholastic school well knew that ' Ab esse ad posse valet consequentia '; but not viceversa: ' Ab posse ad esse non valet consequentia '.\n\nthe summary of De Apice Theoriae, the  beginning of the last proposition. This conclusion of the book may seem a paying off debt which he as cardinal of Catholic Church had to profess according to the Christian faith; instead it represents the failure in exploiting the word Posse for characterizing the  Tri-Unity  more  than  he  had  did  in De Non Aliud ;  hence,  it  represents  also  the  failure  of  his inexhaustible hunting the wise knowledge of the divine beings notwithstanding he had changed his viewpoint in a manifestly metaphysical one.\n\n## 6. Hegel's reckless prolongation of Cusanus' thinking\n\nScholars proved that Hegel knew Cusanus' books or at least their essential contents.\n\nLike Cusanus' logic, the main characteristic features of Hegel's philosophy of logic are the following ones:\n\n1) it is based on terms; that is, it is ancient logic with respect to modern mathematical logic which  started  in  the  second  half  of  the  19 th Century  (Boole,  Frege)  on  the  analysis  of  the propositions  and  their  connections.  2)  It  reasons  through  relations  of  merely  compatibility  of  the terms  composing  a  discourse.  3)  It  represents  an  attempt  of  exiting  out  the  Aristotelian  (i.e. classical)  logic  for  introducing  a  new  one.  4)  Both  attempts  for  a  new  logic  started  from  the reflection on the contradiction principle; they reduced its role to a lateral one, for giving birth to new  logical  principles,  first  of  all  the  principle  of  'the  contradiction  of  the  opposites',  which apparently clashes with the basic principles of classical logic.\n\nHegel seems prolong Cusanus' search on the main more important logical problems of the latter:  1)  how  to  reason  out  of  Aristotelian  logic  through  the  use  of  doubly  negated  terms  (or propositions);  2)  how  to  characterize  reason's  approaching  and  even  achieving  a  transcendent world.\n\nLet us start with the first problem. The main difference of Hegel's logic from the old logic is his claiming to argue through a dialectics which proceeds through the application of a sequence of two negations to a positive term. Since for Hegel this term represents the being in itself, it belongs to classical logic. One may remark that also the negation of this term is again a logical operation of classical  logic.  Hence,  the  entire  novelty  of  Hegel's  logic  concerns  only  the  second  negation. Actually, Hegel characterizes this application , giving rise to the synthesis of both the positive term and its negation, as an Aufhebung . He illustrated this logical step in philosophical terms, but to his posterity the logical interpretation of this process remained unclear.\n\nFirst  of  all,  I  suggest  that  Hegel's  search  for  a  new  logic  clearly  constitutes  a  PO  theory rather  than  a  deductive  theory.  Moreover,  in  order  to  an Aufhebung really  constitute  a  very difference of Hegel's logic from the classical logic it has to represent a logical translation from the classical  one  to  a  kind  of  logic  which  considers  the  doubly  negation  of  a  term  as  essentially different from the positive term; that means the intuitionist logic. In addition, we know that in a PO theory  this  translation  corresponds  to  an  application  of  the  PSR.  It  is  therefore  the  PSR  that translates  Hegel's  doubly  negated  term  of  the  original  positive  term  (or  proposition)  into  the synthesis.\n\nNotice that the philosophical meaning of the PSR is an act of faith in the rationality of the reality; i.e. it is the belief that our correct reasoning correspond to the intimate logic of reality. No surprise then if Hegel systematically applying his Aufhebung process, actually the PSR, states with emphasis that 'What is rational is real' and vice versa 'What is real is rational'.\n\nIn  such  a  way  Hegel  may  claim  that  his  logic  is  not  simply  a  science  of  the  form  of  our thoughts; it is also a science of actual content as  well, and as such has an ontological dimension; clearly,  all  that  pertains  to  metaphysics  only.  He  thought  to  be successful  in  his  aim  because  his kind of Logic, as a whole, has as first Principle that his 'rational' though can develop by using only the resources available to thought itself, without meeting any constraint.\n\nNotice that Hegel ignores that in a PO context even the positive term should be considered as belonging to intuitionist logic, i.e. as only a partial truth which is not in opposition to both its negation  and  its  double  negation  (as  Cusanus  had  well  explained  it).  In  other  terms,  intuitionist negation  is  different  from  the  classical  negation.  So,  inside  a  PO  context  the  application  of  a negation to an affirmative term in order to have the negative term gives no arguing advancement; it simply wanders into the indefinite world of the partial truths. It is only the doubly negated term that gives something of firm, stable, clear meaning. In this sense, Hegel was not wrong in considering the synthesis as an Aufhebung of previous positive and negative terms and moreover in exalting this step as a crucial one; but since his previous listing the positive terms and the negative terms is not a valid  premise  for  trespassing  to  the  synthesis;  this  trespassing  it  is  not  a  logical  translation.  In conclusion he wrote nothing concrete about his dialectical process.\n\nWe can refer all said in the above to the most celebrated instance of his dialectical process, through  which  he  separated  his  philosophy  from  Kant  dialectics  of  the  notions  of  Being  and Nothing.  When  Hegel  states  that  given  'Being',  its  negation  is  'Nothingness'  and  at  last  the synthesis  of  this  process  of  successive  negations  is  'Becoming',  he  does  not  determine  the  last logical step; the word 'Becoming' represents a nice find, ma no one can assure that this word is the only one possible for closing the process; the final word that he suggested ('Becoming') is merely one among the many word which are not incompatible with the previous doubly negated term. As a matter of fact, Hegel's final logical step is not an application of PSR, as a PO context could suggest, of the doubly negated term 'Not Not Being', but an almost free elaboration of it, leading to an illcharacterized term.\n\nA similar conclusion about the under determination of Hegel's typical process is obtained by considering it, in the reverse order. By starting from 'Becoming', we clearly see that this term is only in an approximate way both the negation of 'Nothingness' and the doubly negated term of the first positive previous term, 'Being'.\n\nWe know that an application of the PSR allows escape into an uncontrolled metaphysics unless the two Markov's constraints are fulfilled. Hegel's elaborations of the doubly negated term did not prove ad absurdum theorems or decidabilities. Hegel had no idea of these constraints and therefore freely applies his PSR, which led to transcend in an uncontrolled way the reality of the basic term 11 .\n\nI conclude that the distance of Hegel's logical process from the unique way of interpreting it through modern logic, i.e. an intuitionist logical process, is very great. His inaccurate definition of an Aufhebung process and his implicit application of PSR in a free way opened a great room to not only a metaphysical thinking but also misunderstandings and deviations. No surprise if more than two centuries of studies of Hegel's logic were unsuccessful to establish a common agreement on a minimal content of his logic.\n\nHow all in the above may be linked to Cusanus' thinking? Through Cusanus' notion Posse. Hegel seems to have developed in an a-religious way the identification between substance and spirit suggested by Cusanus' posse ;  the  substance of a being is become spirit and even God is become (absolute)  Spirit.  In  addition,  Hegel  seems  to  have  thought  to  have  solved  Cusanus'  problem  of discovering the way of reasoning inside the new logic: he suggested his dialectics as the wanted new logical tool.\n\nBut under the light of intuitionist logic both his innovations result to be ineffective. About these innovations holds true the old motto: 'What was new (dialectics) was wrong, and what was correct (according to Cusanus: Absolute Spirit) was not new'.\n\nIn  sum,  implicitly  Cusanus  followed  a  clear  kind  of  logic,  in  the  book De  Non  Aliud ; through previous book Possest and the last books he closely approached the reality to metaphysics; instead never a precise kind of logic underlie Hegel's thought; moreover Hegel's free use of PSR always identified in a metaphysical way reality and thinking, so much that he conceived a 'super PSR' concerning more than the relationship of the reasoning with the static reality of the world; this 'super PSR' constitutes a strict relationship between the temporal evolution of human reality with a\n\n11 He  also  ignored  also  that  not  only  in  classical  logic  but  also  in  intuitionist  logic  three  negations  give  one negation; so that its suggestion of a chain of negation from a given affirmative term actually stops after the second one, because a third negation give back the negation of the starting term.\n\nreason which however cannot belong to a single human being, rather a collective being which of course is the Absolute Spirit. He believed that the philosophy of history is to comprehend \"what is and what was\"; wherein, it is \"truer, while adhered to reality\" (Hegel, 1956, p. 292). In this way his theory claimed to have achieved completeness beyond any previous philosophy; it have interpreted the  historical  dynamics  of  human  world,  like  in  theoretical  physics  the  paradigmatic  Newton's theory culminates into a dynamics.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nIn the above, by applying (modal and) intuitionist logic I suggested an answer to the mystery of  the  origin  of  Hegel's  thought  on  logic.  All  went  as  if  Hegel  wanted  to  solve  the  two  main problems of Cusanus' reflection by developing the contents of Cusanus' last books, in particular De Non Aliud and De Apice Theoriae .\n\nThis answer suggests the many reasons of the two centuries of unsuccessful studies aimed at finding  out  both  the  origin  and  the  internal  logic  of  Hegel's  novelty.  First,  the  guilty  silence  of Hegel  on  his  philosophical  sources;  this  silence  constituted  a  great  hindrance  to  discover  his background. Second, the possible term a quo of Hegel's philosophy of logic, i.e. Cusanus' works, was longtime ignored by Hegel's scholars because these books were very difficult to be interpreted in a consistent way. Third, the common qualification of cardinal Cusanus' books, mainly the books of the last  years of his life as mystical discourses on one hand made very arduous to disentangle Cusanus intellectual path which was an essentially logical one (only at  the end of last century  a consistent  and  almost  complete  understanding  of  his  philosophical  production  was  achieved;  cfr. Flasch  2001)  and  on  the  other  hand  made  unlikely  a  connection  to  Hegel's  a-religious  though. Fourth, Cusanus' anticipation of intuitionist logic was unthinkable by Cusanus' scholars, as well as Hegel's scholars, all informed by only classical logic. Fifth, the common prejudice of both AO as the  only  possible  theoretical  organization  and  classical  logic  as  the  only  valid  kind  of  logic prevented the recognition of the model of a PO theory in both Cusanus' and Hegel's productions, as well as their essential use of intuitionist logic; the overcoming this prejudice was the crucial step for deeply  interpreting  Cusanus'  books.  Sixth,  last  but  not  least,  the  scholars  conceived  PSR  as unavoidably leading to uncontrolled thinking; yet, they did not notice Markov's suggestion of two constraints, which gives to PSR a realistic efficiency in performing a fundamental logical operation, i.e. the translation from intuitionist logic to classical logic.\n\nSo  many  difficulties  surpassed  the  capacity  of  the  naïve  logical  search  performed  by  a multitude of scholars of Hegel's philosophy of logic, in particular the followers of  clever Marx' suggestion: \"With him [Hegel] it [dialectic] is standing on its head [metaphysics]. It must be turned right  side  up  again  [the  reality],  if  you  would  discover  the  rational  kernel  within  the  [Hegel's] mystical shell.\" (Marx 1906, p. 25)\n\n## References\n\nCarnot L.
