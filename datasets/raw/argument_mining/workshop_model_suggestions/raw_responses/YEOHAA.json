First, Anscombe claims that \"The primitive sign of wanting is try' to (836), which suggests a teleological criterion of striving or trying intentional attitudes rather than the more negative 'knowledge without servation.

Or only one? The answer that we imagined to the question independent of the following one. [IJf we say there are four actions, we shall find that the only action that B consists in here is A; and so Only; more circumstances are required for A to be B than for A just to be A. And far more circumstances for A to be D; than for A to be B. So there is one action with four descriptions, each dependent on wider circumstances, and each  related to the next as description of means to end.

It the most fascinating about this formulation is the way in which goal. goal ings thing\n\nteleological explanations  are seen to illuminate both internal, intentional structure and external contextualization in the same move As model of action explanation, this points explicitly to notion of agency as embedded self-directedness:' 10\n\nThis point in Anscombe-which she leaves undeveloped\\_is 'fect per place to take up with Hegel: Hegel clearly understands agency in teleological terms, \" but to understand this element ofhis practical philosophy need we to cal account can be given of this production via animation by reasons, then it should respond to the challenge to provide a positive account of the relation underlying the 'because in reasons explanation. Furthermore; if the account could give a teleological specification of the kinds of processes in virtue of which the goals or intentional descriptions of an action are related as means to end, it appears that it could also tell us something about distinguishing the right kinds of causal chains in the context of intentional descriptions. primary interpretive thesis is that we should see Hegel as providing resources for such an account, and therefore as much to in the of say context contemporary analytic philosophy of action. My having teleology to this tradition through another thought of Anscombe's. In discussing the relevance of causal  factors  in understanding of human Anscombe relationships; notes that,\n\nThese causalities are mostly to be understood derivatively: The derivation is the understanding of action as intentional,   calculated,  voluntary; impulsive; involuntary reluctant; concessive; passionate etc: The first we know; quarrels, struggles; embassies; wars, pressures, pursuits of given ends; routines; institutional practices of all sorts. That is to in our of say: descriptions their histories; we apply such conceptions of what people are engaged in. In the context of such application, then, the causalities to which we ascribe such events can, SO to speak, foothold. Given the idea of an engagement to from thing get\n\nThe multiplicity of description here is both a source ofthe power of the point made and a reason to doubt whether we are increasing our understandifwe accept it. As Davidson points out, the very idea of interpreting an action as intentional through placing it in a pattern does not, in itself; advance our understanding of the nature of action unless we know something about that pattern and what differentiates it from others (after all, causation is a pattern as well) '3 But Hegel makes a similar priority claim for teleology being ing\n\nopposed to causal mechanism; in that he argues that causal mechanisms only be individuated by the purposes that explain their functioning,'4 d the specificity of Hegel's conception holds out the promise of refining scombe' s insight into a positive account of the productivity of agency:\n\nWith respect to this analytic background, one of the most interesting about Hegel's discussion is the way in which he interprets the causal 17 eorist's to law as a way of individuating mechanisms. ' Here, Hegel specifically thinking in terms of a kind of mechanical system that would ve a law that regulated its interactions with other systems-and regulated another-via certain state of e interactions of its with each 18 rium that the system tended to maintain . The systems Hegel considers therefore homeostatic; and such systems have been thought by analytic model for the reduction of teleological ilosophers to present a promising lations to the causal feedback  mechanisms that are thought to underlie em In fact, Davidson explicitly associates the causal power of free action 19 ith just such types of systems ings appeal equiparts\n\nGiven the constraints of space, I will attempt neither to reconstruct defend Hegel's argument for this priority '5 Instead, I want to focus the relation between ends and mechanical causes that develops through and in particular Hegel's claim that causal mechanical argument, teractions serve as the means or techniques by which ends produce and manifest themselves.16 egel's\n\nBut on Hegel's view; because the law is no longer merely an arrangeent of elements but rather specifies an ideal state towards which the system it is not necessarily actualized within the system individuated by that 20 w, nor is the achievement of the state necessary to individuate the herefore, within the explanatory scheme of mechanism, which, in Hegel's be nception of it, demands existent objects as explananda; the law cannot and proper explanation of the genesis or behavior of mechanistic systems, 21 ierefore cannot be used to individuate such systems By contrast, rected behavior is trying to achieve the and this process is regulated the (behaviors are selected which tend to achieve the goal, and are odified in such way that tend to achieve the even in the face obstacles or changing circumstances) . So the end governs the process of own individual realization in way that mechanistic principles do not. ecause ends themselves change through that influence in way that laws not, are actualized in a more complete way: laws are instantiated but Inds, system goal goal, goal goal they they ends are realized. The reciprocal interaction of end and behavior in trying makes the end an existent and immanent organizing principle in way that laws are not, on Hegel's view.\n\nIn the contemporary literature; Wright has argued for the irreducibility of teleology in similar terms: Larry\n\nAppropriate-but-unsuccessful  behavior may well be the most central kind of teleological behavior; both conceptually and identificatorily; for ic is the behavior of trying; And not only is trying one of the most emphatically teleologicalconcepts but trying behavior constitutes the majority of that systematically behavior we are most reliable in identifying as teleological.  The clearest cases of hunting, and building consist largely of attempts success is quite usually elusive. What makes us predator is stalking\\_rather than writhing or undergoing spasms\\_is the systematic organization ofthe movements about the goal-object, or about the obvious clues to the goalobject; or about something that might be mistaken for a clue: It is this systematicity that makes the direction of the behavior so obvious. And the particular systematicity that gives direction to bit of behavior is that which obtains when that behavior arises because it tends to produce certain result. [Tlhe behavior was plastic and persistent with respect to that result.22 complex fleeing, say\n\nWright = that the fact argues that such systematic plasticity and persistence entail the possibility of a wide range of causal processes that would count as such trying means that it is hopeless to attempt to reduce the teleological relation to an underlying efficient 23 causal one Goal-directed behavior is identified instead by the pattern of the activity's responsiveness the to and the for resources its achievement in the environment: The trying is the objective phenomenon; that which is clear to all who have eyes to see. goal\n\nHegel's version of this claim is phrased in terms of a conception of self determination as elasticity\" as opposed to the passivity involved in causal interaction, fascinating conception whose surface I can only scratch here.24 In that passage is immensely suggestive of the import of this discussion for the question of agency; Hegel writes of mechanism as technique for directed self-determination: goal-\n\n[For mechanism and chemism], end is the selfdeterminer [Selbstbestimmende] that back into the unity of the concept the external determinedness by which it is conditioned. From this can be seen the nature ofthe subordination of the two previous forms of the objective process Thus mechanical or chemical technique, through its character of externally determined, offers itself spontaneously to the end relation.25 brings being\n\nThis idea receives its most detailed formulation within Hegel's treatment of teleology through the claim that the means itself is the most significant and\n\nrealization of the end. In developing this thought, Hegel contrasts mplete way in which the interpenetration of ends and objectivity in the means ntrasts with the achievement of finite, fleeting ends such as the satisfacn of desires:\n\nFurther, since the end is finite it has finite content; accordingly it is not absolute, nor simply something that in its own nature is rational But the means is the external middle term of the syllogism which is the realization of the end; in the means; therefore; the rationality in it manifests itself as such by maintaining itself in this external other; and precisely through this externality: To this extent the means is superior to the finite ends of external purposiveness: the plough is more honourable than are immediately the enjoyments procured by it and which are ends. The tool lasts; while the immediate enjoyments pass away and are forgotten. In his tools man possesses power over external nature, even though in respect of his ends he is, on the contrarys subject to it.\n\nidea here is that in using a means for an end\\_especially repeatedly\\_we ange the means in such a way that it comes to represent more completely particular end for which it was the means.  In fact, Hegel thinks that rough successful use of a means we can in fact make an initially external Irpose into an internal purpose: When a baseball player breaks in a glove; example, he makes it into an object that has his own playing style and Ind shape as its immanent principle: After season, the glove comes to present his fielding in a way that perhaps no particular play could: This is ue even though the end itself is necessarily subject to external influences, g. in the way that the desire to be a fielder might be inculcated by a rent or community: Our use of the techniques of the means is way in hich we assert ourselves in the face of that influence; way in which we anage that influence: The means is therefore Hegel's way of talking about ying as objective and substantial. legel's good\n\nIn Hegelian terms, the means is a way in which the reflection-into-self goal-directed selfdetermining is elasticity, and so it is not surprising that holds of the means that in it, the end's reflection-into-self is itself also Ifexternal and a reflection outwards.\"27 That is, the means is particular ay in which the goal-directed system opens itselfup to external influence by lecting and directing that influence way in which it is active towards the rce of that influence rather than merely passive: In a remarkable passage at illustrates this function of the means, Hegel writes, egel that the end itself in mediate relation with the object and interposes another object between itself and it, may be regarded as the cunning of reason: allows it to wear itself out in [The end] puts forward an object as means, posits\n\nits stead, exposes it to attrition and shields itself behind it from mechanical violence. 28\n\nIt is through the means, therefore; that self-determination is protected from the alienation of the mechanical relationship of cause and effect. But more to the current point; the end represents the constancy of systematic orientation that is maintained behind but also through the manifold and changing causal interactions that constitute the goal-directed behavior in the means.\n\nOn the one hand, this seems to suggest that some causal theorists may be correct in thinking that they need not provide specific criterion for distinguishing intentional from deviant causal chains, since the intrinsic plasticity with respect to the processes employed in goal-directed self-determination entails a diversity of such processes. But on the other hand, what lets the causal theorist off the hook is, on Hegel's view; a fundamentally distinct and irreducible conception of productivity:  To see this, consider another version of the example of the waiter who wants to startle his employer: One can imagine a situation in which the waiter feels his nervousness coming on, and recognizes it as a technique that might be exploited to do what he might otherwise not have the nerve to do. He refrains from controlling his nervousness and instead lets it play out next to the stack of glasses. The glasses are spilled and the employer is startled. In that case, I think we would say that the waiter intentionally startled his employer; even though the causal chain is non-standard, it is not deviant in the relevant sense. What accounts for the difference between this case and Wilson's case, in which the nervousness is a deviant chain?  Locating the difference in an additional causal chain of a certain sort is unlikely to help (e.g. control from some higher-order mental state), because that chain as well can either be employed or not by the directed activity in question. But this is the to the answer: the waiter in this second example acts intentionally because the control of the intention is represented by the plasticity with which the realization of that intention is pursued, and the way in which new means are recognized when present themselves.29 That is, the plasticity is a way of talking about the way in which the purpose illuminates the context and presents processes as means; this is the cunning of reason. And notice that it does so by introducing the interaction of and context in the way that Anscombe's account of the relation between intentional descriptions suggested. This suggests that Anscombe's myriad patterns for the relation of intentions to actions might be understood as variations on the basic form of the teleological relation. point goalkey they goals\n\nA complaint about a contemporary teleological account can help to further bring out the interest of Hegel's account here: In commenting on that teleological considerations explain only facts, not events actions,and these actions track an objective relation between reasons and actions that constitute those actions as intentional : Causation is a 30 Now; Hegel does not share these intuitions about cicher teleology or causa tion, In egct, Hegel holds that teleology promises a better articulation of the individuality of its relata than mechanism does, and it is interesting to see why 31 specific general singular singular\n\nNow insofar as end is this total reflection of objectivity into itself and is SO immediately, in the first place; the selfdetermination or particularity as simple self is distinct from the concrete form, and is a determinate reflection into although in respect of its form it is content. From this side end is finite, because its determinateness has the form side tscfinitude consists of being confronted by an objective, mechanical and world which its activity relates itself as to something already there; chemical to is thus, in its identity; immediately external to itself Accordingly; the of end can now be expressed as having for its aim to supersede that is the immediacy of the object, and to posit the object its presupposition, Positively, [this process] is the realization as determined by the concept. of the end.32 much the Hegel holds that one distinctive feature of teleology is the fact that reciprocal interaction betwcen end and means results in the modification be encnown transformation follows from its role as the immanent organizing principle of the means:\n\nin the form of dif Here, the end confronts conditions that it presupposes But it ferent mechanical systems lying about in the context of expression. those mechanisms according constitutes that context by forming and sorting (Sache) for which it to its own ends; the context is constituted by the 33 But precisely because this forming and sorting takes place is the context initial establishment of context presupposing, it takes the form of the invisible still from the perspective of the end that is, to an important extent, do not normally recognize the way in which our directed determine our context; since our attention is more naturally point goals to changing that context to achieve our goals, but often this feature is very visible to others. For example, when we say of someone that he has a on his shoulder; part of what we mean is that he is looking to constitute external events as insults to which he can respond, and even though he does not realize this fact, it is clear to others who then try to avoid saying or anything that could be construed as a slight to him. This is a classic case in which the non-intentional background of intentional behavior is 'behind the herself only by breakdowns such as alienating contexts oppressive factory work) where the dominance ofone in constituting the context results in failure of agency due to other inability to form their context in this way: In these breakdowns, subconscious strategies for making the world into the context of our acour tions are revealed precisely through their unexpected ineffectiveness. Hegel, might expect, holds that the true teleological relation must make this %oroing and sorting explicit: That is, it must show that forming and sorting to be positing an active contribution of the agent\\_rather than merely a presupposing\\_a passive receptivity to a given fact: Thus a theoretical problem for the notion of expression is made into practical problem for individual expressers (whether agents or single-celled organisms). Or; to put it in terms of Hegelian phenomenology; the implicit contribution of the subject's self: understanding is thematized and thus made into part of the problem that the action is attempting to solve. In so the problem becomes not a form of skepticism to be refuted but a potentially alienating element that is to be managed. doing agent (e.g agent's goals agents' one doing,\n\nOn Hegel's view; if the end is to be truly immanent; it must take on its full character in the processes that constitute the means as an object; these its activity; the process of its objective realization. Even though the end is are to be conceived as directing the process of engagement with its context; the nonetheless the end to external conditions. These conditions process exposes create an intelligible distinction between an internal, basic character of the end and the more particular form of its external realization; are the way in which the teleological idea differentiates itself from its own expression. This happens only in the engagement of the means by the end, but may easily the illusion that there must be some prior end acting mechanically generate on the means. It is precisely to combat this illusion that Hegel differentiates teleology from force and cause: they and The end [Zweck] is therefore the subjective concept as striving drive to posit itself externally: End may indeed also be defined as force and essential\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncause; but these expressions fulfill only an incomplete side of its significance; if they are to be predicated ofit as it truly is, can be predicated only in a way that supersedes their concept: as a force that solicits itself to externalization, as a cause; which is the cause of itself or whose effect is immediately cause. # they\n\nTeleological production is therefore clearly intended by Hegel to be a replacement for the notion of a self-cause that has played such an important role in understandings of agency: But more to the point, the intensive interaction between and causal context effectively rebuts the charge that purposes can only explain facts instead of specific events, since the explanatory purposes evolve to be specifically related to the action they explain during the process of its production. The problem of explaining particular actions arises only if we treat such purposes as what Hegel would term abstract universals\\_ But on Hegel's view; this is a conception more ap: propriate to the covering laws of purportedly singular connections than to internal purposiveness . quite goal general quite causal\n\nThis point is important for understanding the differences between causation and teleological productivity as a model of action. One might think that -term would be best represented as abstract universals, e.g. survival Or reproduction, and thus that the abstract/ singular distinction was independent of the causal law/goal-directedness distinction. But the explanations of specific actions-and a fortiori of long-term projects-will be more satisfying to the extent that, e.g survival in a particular way as a particular kind of person is invoked as an explanation, and this points to the fact that the realization of such general modifies and specifies them such that, at best, the general term is just a shorthand reference to the more form of the But this recursive transformation of the in context makes the unilinear picture of causation under covering laws inapt as a general description of the kind of productivity at issue. If Hegel is right about this, then goal-directed productivity cannot be articulated as any specific and distinct kind of causal process , and on this point Hegel has common cause with Wright in rejectthe reduction of teleology to efficient causal mechanisms 3 For Hegel, the important contrast is the local, minimally diachronic causal linkage as opposed to the global, more fully diachronic systematic orientation of the pattern of causal linkages.   The systematic orientation of the system itself changes through its realizations of the (and the frustration of attempts at realization) this is why the plasticity of the system is an articulation of this recursiveness\\_but this change cannot necessarily be represented in the abstract as adoption of one kind of causal chain as to anlong; goals goals specific goal. goal ing goal opposed specific other (though such a change may be involved if such would be an appropriate technique for the reorientation of the system) change\n\nTo realize our ends, we use our bodies as means in mechanical relations to other objects. But this action on the world has a reaction on us and changes Us, and in turn modifies our ends. As this recursive process continues the end and the means are further and further integrated into each other; so that what begins in infancy as a relatively external relation between the body and purposes can develop into tighter fit. The case in which ones end is realized exactly as planned is just a limit case of this schema (both in theory and in practice) .  Even when the end is perfectly realized, it is still changed in the sense that its realization puts it into connection with a host of conditions and events surrounding the action. Ifthe plan is perfect; then this just means that the agent completely put the end into relation with such conditions in the planning process, thus transforming the end internally in anticipation of the resources and contingencies that would be encountered in the external world. But such a perfectly planned and realized end is a limit case-not the paradigm The paradigm cases are those in which we modify our ends both beforehand in anticipation of the context of externalization; and then subsequently as our knowledge or control of that context turns out to be imperfect. I plan, for example; an itinerary for family trip into account the usual weather for this time of year and my children's current nap schedules, but then this must be adjusted on the fly if the weather changes drastically or my toddler poorly the night before. This reciprocal interaction between and context can go either way; of course. Ifthe changes much more than the taking sleeps goal goal\n\nIn this way, Hegel's view has important advantages over Rowland Stout's contemporary teleological view of agency; which similarly holds that the deviant causal chains are deviant because eliminate teleological processes by introducing an element that is not sensitive to the means-end relation. In Stout's causal chains which can be broken down into component events are distinguished from causal processes that, though require \"a certain kind of structure of stages to occur; at any one moment when process is happening, what is happening is the whole process, not just part of it.\"36 Stout then defines a 'mechanism as \"a persisting; selfstanding, entity within the underlying conditions of a process that has the capacity either to undergo or to cause the characteristic stages of that process.\"31 To deal with cases of deviant causal chains, Stout wants to include the condithey theory they\n\ntions that constitute non-interference as part of the underlying nature of the process, so that it is clear that the interference present in the deviant chain cases ends the relevant teleological process and thus erases agency from the event: 38 But this inclusion of a non-interference condition within the essential properties of the process is implausible both because of the necessity of interference or resistance in some form or other,39 and because it therefore to rule out the need for the plasticity and persistence that is central appears to any teleological process. This explains why plasticity and persistence\\_fall out of Stouts account in favor of a less substantive sensitivity to the The former; however; is a messier but more informative and intuitive account of teleological processes: So, for example, Stout is forced to distinguish between the process ofthe sun warming up the stone (if there is nothing to interfere) and the process of the sun stopping the stone from cooling down (if a cool: wind interferes with the former process) But it is deeply counterintuitive to individuate processes in this way; given the omnipresence of interfering conditions in the real world, this method of individuation would multiply basic processes beyond all reason. goal ing\n\nThe basic problems that Stout faces concern the relation between structure and its underlying conditions; in Hegelian terms, between an essence and its appearance; or between the idea and the context of its expression. On the one hand, Stout has the insight that interference can change the nature of a process. But on the other hand, his concern to establish the continuous presence of an underlying condition leads him to argue that such a change results in a completely new process.4 As à result, the elasticity in Hegel's sense, of goaloriented activity is effectively denied .  This also comes out in the way that events happening during a process are ruled out for that reason by Stout as inputs to the process; which is another deeply counterintuitive consequence of his characterization of processes.4 In addition, by Stout's own admission, his insistence on the selfstanding nature of the mechanism means that the capacities that it grounds are understood much more broadly than is normal that not only the watch but also the spring within it has the capacity to tell the time) . This is essentially the problem of the arbitrariness of individuation that Hegel holds follows the false (because rigid) independence of mechanisms. If Hegel is right that the end that specifies the basic character of a teleological process and the means that represents the developed articulation of that character reciprocally interact with each other; then he has a (e.g from mechanism without either of the two counterintuitive results of Stout's view (the fragility of processes in the face of interference and the over-extension of the concept of mechanism), both of which follow from the rigidity of independence on Stout's conception.\n\n&lt;We can see Hegel's avoidance of the second problem (the over-extension of the concept of mechanism) by using these ideas to address the example of the watch. On Hegel's view, we to individuate the watch as a whole as the mechanism to tell time rather than just the spring because the watch as whole includes means to adjust the functioning of the watch to maintain correct time in the face of variable circumstances, whereas the spring itself ought\n\nHegel's avoidance of the first result is just his inclusion of plasticity and persistence in the nature of a teleological process, as described above: It is only in those cases in which the interference overwhelms the capacity of the teleological process to maintain its goalorientation that we should think of the teleological process as and thus, in the case of agency; the causal chain as being deviant rather than intentional . So, for example; in Wilson's original case of the waiter who accidentally startles his employer because he becomes nervous at the thought of doing the fuller picture of the waiter's psychology will be dominated by causal chains that tend to either avoid the result or bring it about in a different way at a different time. The causal chain that extends from the desire to startle to the startling through the nervousness is therefore deviant both in the sense that it contrasts with the preponderance of the agent's orientation and in the sense that nervousness that is the link in the chain is actually a byproduct of the contrary desires to avoid the startling or to execute it at another time. In the modified example; the agent recognizes this function of the nervousness and then the preponderance of his psychology would be directed at non-interference with this mechanism Or indirect nurturing of it (fanning the flames of his nervousness, to mix metaphors). Of course, the possibility of self-deception muddies the waters here, but the criterion for distinguishing deviant from standard intentional chains is the systematic orientation ofthe agents intentional stance, including those causal chains that are not directly productive of the action.

If this is not to be a bare counterfactual, we need to tell some story of how the reason is actually related to the action so that the being\n\ncounterfactual receives some support. To provide such a categorical basis for the counterfactual the Causalist may simply appeal to the relation between attitudinal reason and action causal\n\nRoth   argues, the teleological   relation   will not support such specific counterfactuals. It strikes me that from Hegelian perspective, there are at least two difficulties with this argument. The first is that it seems incredible that simply appealing to the idea of a causal relation as support for a counterfactual gives any insight into that counterfactual or leaves it any less bare than before. In fact, it seems more likely that the counterfactuals will inform our understanding of the causal relation  Second, it is well known that the causal relation cannot be understood as a necessary condition the lines assumed by Roth, since over-determination cases are unavoidable counterexamples. Just as one bomb may have caused the collapse of a house before a second bomb had a chance to do the same, Lisa may also have wanted desire that would have caused her to go for a bike ride in the absence of her desire to exercise, but was not causally active in the face of that desire: But, along\n\nBy contrast; explanation by purposes does support counterfactuals, and in a much more relevant sense than even the purported one that we have just seen to fail. This is what distinguishes the normal case of the assassin the target through a direct shot from Davidson's example of the stampeding pigs: achieving the ofkilling the target is more certain and exposed to contingency through the direct shot, and so it is easier to see it as an example of trying to kill the target.  We therefore believe that the shooter who instead startled the pigs would have compensated for whatever error or circumstance caused her to miss; had she been made aware of it beforehand.45 This is a counterfactual that ties the agent to her context in virtue of her competencea way of talking about her skills as means and thus is a counterfactual that articulates a 46 substantial element of our understanding of agency: It does not, of course, have the logical simplicity of Roth's suggested counterfactual, but I take it to be the Hegelian judgment that it is none the worse off for it. killing goal less\n\nThese two Hegelian theses-the significance ofthe means and the necessary transformation of the end\\_articulate the of self-determination as elasticity: In the contemporary understanding; they are ways of understanding the plasticity and persistence with respect to the that defines all directed behavior as the way in which the selects behaviors that conduce to its realization. And it is this conception of plasticity and persistence that shape goal goalgoal\n\nof teleological production; and provides the content of the positive account thus also a way of distinguishing intentional from deviant causal chains:\n\nFinally, since plasticity and persistence are related to the way in which does specifically as an account of embedded agency It does so because the SO theorist primarily serves as the condiexternal context that for the causal tions under which the beliefs and desires that cause action are formed plays a more expanded role in Hegels account of productivity and a role which is more in line with interpretivist theories The diversity and meaningfulness that Anscombe so powerfully makes central to of natural and social context substantial the understanding and explanation of action are organized by a articulation of the force of the 'because' in action explanations by reasons or intentions, and an articulation that is, broadly speaking, productive in the that the causal theorist expects. In Hegel's theory; context plays the role way of the development of intentions, but this development is of the condition recursive; and occurs just as much through the influence of the context on the realization of the intention as in its influence on the initial formation of the intention (ifthis latter process is considered to be something contrastively internal and subjective). It is a model of productivity that therefore embeds the medium of the selfdevelopment of her own the agent in her context as goals, and thus embeds the context in the agent as a system of means for selfexpression. In this way, relatively external purposes that begin either as abstractly subjective or as merely given by natural or social features of the be internalized through the continual working of the on context can that such internalization be successful-this the context. It is not necessary teleological account makes the problem of alienation central concern in the theory of agency; and this is particularly apparent in Hegel's discussions in the Phenomenology: But the account also holds out the possibility of grounding theory of free will as the non-alienated experience of nature a of at home and community which must surely be Hegel's conception with oneself in the other;47 goals goal being\n\n## NOTES\n\n- 1 .

This criterion of non-observational knowledge is plausibly interpreted in terms of a strict introspectability of the relevant reasons for an action, which is then put to use in rejection of the causal view through the plausible observation that for a number of paradigmatically intentional actions, there simply is no introspectable reason-state (a desire or belief) to serve as the cause of the action. (See Rosalind Hursthouse, \"Intention, pp. 86-88.) But the strictness of that criterion has seemed overly high a bar to many. Davidson, Those who have that there are no mental events to qualify as causes of actions have often missed the obvious because they have insisted that a mental event be observed or noticed (rather than an observing or a noticing)\" (Davidson, Essays, p. 12). This is connected with the fact that Davidson denies that the belief or desire is, strictly speaking, an event at all or need be in order to play its role in the event-causal story: In any event, Anscombe's clearest presentation ofhow an intention is non-observational knowledge is in terms of a kind of formal priority of maker's knowledge over its performance, formulation grounded in Aquinas's characterization of practical knowledge as 'the cause of what it understands, which brings us around full circle to the question of the productivity of action, even though this cause is not to be understood as a mere extra feature of events causal large argued\n\n- 9 Anscombe,  Intention, S26.

Anscombe herself rejects what she considers to be the restriction of her view to teleological account, in claiming that Aristotle's understanding exceeds our own in allowing at least for four kinds of causes-and yet even four is not enough (\"The Causation of Action,\" in Knowledge and Mind, ed.

To be clear; Hegel's concern in the Science of Logic is quite a bit broader than the concern about proper as opposed to deviant causal chains matter of agency: In his discussion of causation, mechanism and teleology Hegel is concerned with the more fundamental question ofhow we individuate or explain anything at all. But if Hegel is right that in general mechanical systems of causal interaction are individuated only by reference to the ends that they manifest, then there is every reason to approach agency from this perspective. Again, will not attempt here to judge the truth of this antecedent claim but rather to explore the consequent project against the background of this analytic dispute about agency.\n19.

Roth then proposes 'situational environmentalist\" account in which singular causal relation is posited between the action and a mental state in which contextual are represented. Thus the mental state forges an explanatory tie between the action and its circumstances, and thus provides a way of accounting for complex action over time and in context. Though very suggestive, Roth's positive account is not well developed in this article. Indeed, it is not clear that it extends at all beyond Davidson's original account, in which beliefs about the environment and desires for the realization of certain are conditions that combine with paradigmatic precisely those homeostatic systems that Davdison also understands as models of the causal power of free will (\"Reasons Explanations of Actions: Causal, Singular; and 839-74, 852) features goals\n\n- 31 .

Though these themes play role in Hegel's mature philosophy; they are largely absent from the writings in his Frankfurt argues that essential  elements of the mature  position on autonomy and conscience can already be found in the treatments in the early writings of moral motivation, moral conflict, formal freedom, and intersubjectivity. large essay hen one thinks of Fichte's response to reading Kant; or of Schelling' s response to reading Fichte, Hegel's development to full philosophical original: seems torturously slow. Of the dozen years (1793-1805) that constitute that journey; the two best documented phases are the years in Frankfurt under the influence of Hölderlin and the early years in Jena under the influence of Schelling Much less clear is the path that led Hegel from his Schelling: inspired position of 1801-1803 to the dramatically different view expressed in the Phenomenology of Spirit and essentially carried into his mature philoso phy. This transformation, from the Schellingean language of intuition and Indifferenz to his own conception of self-consciousness as negativity, is the indirect concern of this paper: My main purpose here is to go further back, before the Frankfurt period, to uncover dimension of Hegel's early thinkthat played a major role in that final phase of his development almost a decade later: A central, and still rather puzzling dimension of the final turn is a thorough reintegration of the standpoint of the autonomous individual into the social conception of Spirit. ' The autonomous agent of conscience appears in a very prominent place in the Phenomenology; namely at the end of the Spirit\" chapter; where this conceptual figure is the historically latest and systematically most advanced of Spirit. The discussion of conscience is ity ing shape",

First, Anscombe claims that \"The primitive sign of wanting is try' to (836), which suggests a teleological criterion of striving or trying intentional attitudes rather than the more negative 'knowledge without servation.

Or only one? The answer that we imagined to the question independent of the following one. [IJf we say there are four actions, we shall find that the only action that B consists in here is A; and so Only; more circumstances are required for A to be B than for A just to be A. And far more circumstances for A to be D; than for A to be B. So there is one action with four descriptions, each dependent on wider circumstances, and each  related to the next as description of means to end. When terms are related in this fashion, constitute a series of means, the last term of which is, just by being given as the last, so far treated as end on. they hen I explain why the agent acted, my explanation therefore tracks a series nested goals, each of which brings with it more context through the way at it is connected with the previous So explanation by D ('He moved arm in order to poison the inhabitants' ~or He moved his arm because wanted to poison the inhabitants' is the most complete and satisfying of e series in two ways: first, it is the final ofthe series, and so throws the ost light on the internal structure of the series by identifying the process which all four are connected parts; and second, in so doing it implicitly more information about the outside world into our understanding of vill not attempt here to read the rest of that work in teleological terms. It the most fascinating about this formulation is the way in which goal. goal ings thing\n\nteleological explanations  are seen to illuminate both internal, intentional structure and external contextualization in the same move As model of action explanation, this points explicitly to notion of agency as embedded self-directedness:' 10\n\nThis point in Anscombe-which she leaves undeveloped\\_is 'fect per place to take up with Hegel: Hegel clearly understands agency in teleological terms, \" but to understand this element ofhis practical philosophy need we to cal account can be given of this production via animation by reasons, then it should respond to the challenge to provide a positive account of the relation underlying the 'because in reasons explanation. Furthermore; if the account could give a teleological specification of the kinds of processes in virtue of which the goals or intentional descriptions of an action are related as means to end, it appears that it could also tell us something about distinguishing the right kinds of causal chains in the context of intentional descriptions. primary interpretive thesis is that we should see Hegel as providing resources for such an account, and therefore as much to in the of say context contemporary analytic philosophy of action. My having teleology to this tradition through another thought of Anscombe's. In discussing the relevance of causal  factors  in understanding of human Anscombe relationships; notes that,\n\nThese causalities are mostly to be understood derivatively: The derivation is the understanding of action as intentional,   calculated,  voluntary; impulsive; involuntary reluctant; concessive; passionate etc: The first we know; quarrels, struggles; embassies; wars, pressures, pursuits of given ends; routines; institutional practices of all sorts. That is to in our of say: descriptions their histories; we apply such conceptions of what people are engaged in. In the context of such application, then, the causalities to which we ascribe such events can, SO to speak, foothold. Given the idea of an engagement to from thing get\n\nThe multiplicity of description here is both a source ofthe power of the point made and a reason to doubt whether we are increasing our understandifwe accept it. As Davidson points out, the very idea of interpreting an action as intentional through placing it in a pattern does not, in itself; advance our understanding of the nature of action unless we know something about that pattern and what differentiates it from others (after all, causation is a pattern as well) '3 But Hegel makes a similar priority claim for teleology being ing\n\nopposed to causal mechanism; in that he argues that causal mechanisms only be individuated by the purposes that explain their functioning,'4 d the specificity of Hegel's conception holds out the promise of refining scombe' s insight into a positive account of the productivity of agency:\n\nWith respect to this analytic background, one of the most interesting about Hegel's discussion is the way in which he interprets the causal 17 eorist's to law as a way of individuating mechanisms. ' Here, Hegel specifically thinking in terms of a kind of mechanical system that would ve a law that regulated its interactions with other systems-and regulated another-via certain state of e interactions of its with each 18 rium that the system tended to maintain . The systems Hegel considers therefore homeostatic; and such systems have been thought by analytic model for the reduction of teleological ilosophers to present a promising lations to the causal feedback  mechanisms that are thought to underlie em In fact, Davidson explicitly associates the causal power of free action 19 ith just such types of systems ings appeal equiparts\n\nGiven the constraints of space, I will attempt neither to reconstruct defend Hegel's argument for this priority '5 Instead, I want to focus the relation between ends and mechanical causes that develops through and in particular Hegel's claim that causal mechanical argument, teractions serve as the means or techniques by which ends produce and manifest themselves.16 egel's\n\nBut on Hegel's view; because the law is no longer merely an arrangeent of elements but rather specifies an ideal state towards which the system it is not necessarily actualized within the system individuated by that 20 w, nor is the achievement of the state necessary to individuate the herefore, within the explanatory scheme of mechanism, which, in Hegel's be nception of it, demands existent objects as explananda; the law cannot and proper explanation of the genesis or behavior of mechanistic systems, 21 ierefore cannot be used to individuate such systems By contrast, rected behavior is trying to achieve the and this process is regulated the (behaviors are selected which tend to achieve the goal, and are odified in such way that tend to achieve the even in the face obstacles or changing circumstances) . So the end governs the process of own individual realization in way that mechanistic principles do not. ecause ends themselves change through that influence in way that laws not, are actualized in a more complete way: laws are instantiated but Inds, system goal goal, goal goal they they ends are realized. The reciprocal interaction of end and behavior in trying makes the end an existent and immanent organizing principle in way that laws are not, on Hegel's view.\n\nIn the contemporary literature; Wright has argued for the irreducibility of teleology in similar terms: Larry\n\nAppropriate-but-unsuccessful  behavior may well be the most central kind of teleological behavior; both conceptually and identificatorily; for ic is the behavior of trying; And not only is trying one of the most emphatically teleologicalconcepts but trying behavior constitutes the majority of that systematically behavior we are most reliable in identifying as teleological.  The clearest cases of hunting, and building consist largely of attempts success is quite usually elusive. What makes us predator is stalking\\_rather than writhing or undergoing spasms\\_is the systematic organization ofthe movements about the goal-object, or about the obvious clues to the goalobject; or about something that might be mistaken for a clue: It is this systematicity that makes the direction of the behavior so obvious. And the particular systematicity that gives direction to bit of behavior is that which obtains when that behavior arises because it tends to produce certain result. [Tlhe behavior was plastic and persistent with respect to that result.22 complex fleeing, say\n\nWright = that the fact argues that such systematic plasticity and persistence entail the possibility of a wide range of causal processes that would count as such trying means that it is hopeless to attempt to reduce the teleological relation to an underlying efficient 23 causal one Goal-directed behavior is identified instead by the pattern of the activity's responsiveness the to and the for resources its achievement in the environment: The trying is the objective phenomenon; that which is clear to all who have eyes to see. goal\n\nHegel's version of this claim is phrased in terms of a conception of self determination as elasticity\" as opposed to the passivity involved in causal interaction, fascinating conception whose surface I can only scratch here.24 In that passage is immensely suggestive of the import of this discussion for the question of agency; Hegel writes of mechanism as technique for directed self-determination: goal-\n\n[For mechanism and chemism], end is the selfdeterminer [Selbstbestimmende] that back into the unity of the concept the external determinedness by which it is conditioned. From this can be seen the nature ofthe subordination of the two previous forms of the objective process Thus mechanical or chemical technique, through its character of externally determined, offers itself spontaneously to the end relation.25 brings being\n\nThis idea receives its most detailed formulation within Hegel's treatment of teleology through the claim that the means itself is the most significant and\n\nrealization of the end. In developing this thought, Hegel contrasts mplete way in which the interpenetration of ends and objectivity in the means ntrasts with the achievement of finite, fleeting ends such as the satisfacn of desires:\n\nFurther, since the end is finite it has finite content; accordingly it is not absolute, nor simply something that in its own nature is rational But the means is the external middle term of the syllogism which is the realization of the end; in the means; therefore; the rationality in it manifests itself as such by maintaining itself in this external other; and precisely through this externality: To this extent the means is superior to the finite ends of external purposiveness: the plough is more honourable than are immediately the enjoyments procured by it and which are ends. The tool lasts; while the immediate enjoyments pass away and are forgotten. In his tools man possesses power over external nature, even though in respect of his ends he is, on the contrarys subject to it.\n\nidea here is that in using a means for an end\\_especially repeatedly\\_we ange the means in such a way that it comes to represent more completely particular end for which it was the means.  In fact, Hegel thinks that rough successful use of a means we can in fact make an initially external Irpose into an internal purpose: When a baseball player breaks in a glove; example, he makes it into an object that has his own playing style and Ind shape as its immanent principle: After season, the glove comes to present his fielding in a way that perhaps no particular play could: This is ue even though the end itself is necessarily subject to external influences, g. in the way that the desire to be a fielder might be inculcated by a rent or community: Our use of the techniques of the means is way in hich we assert ourselves in the face of that influence; way in which we anage that influence: The means is therefore Hegel's way of talking about ying as objective and substantial. legel's good\n\nIn Hegelian terms, the means is a way in which the reflection-into-self goal-directed selfdetermining is elasticity, and so it is not surprising that holds of the means that in it, the end's reflection-into-self is itself also Ifexternal and a reflection outwards.\"27 That is, the means is particular ay in which the goal-directed system opens itselfup to external influence by lecting and directing that influence way in which it is active towards the rce of that influence rather than merely passive: In a remarkable passage at illustrates this function of the means, Hegel writes, egel that the end itself in mediate relation with the object and interposes another object between itself and it, may be regarded as the cunning of reason: allows it to wear itself out in [The end] puts forward an object as means, posits\n\nits stead, exposes it to attrition and shields itself behind it from mechanical violence. 28\n\nIt is through the means, therefore; that self-determination is protected from the alienation of the mechanical relationship of cause and effect. But more to the current point; the end represents the constancy of systematic orientation that is maintained behind but also through the manifold and changing causal interactions that constitute the goal-directed behavior in the means.\n\nOn the one hand, this seems to suggest that some causal theorists may be correct in thinking that they need not provide specific criterion for distinguishing intentional from deviant causal chains, since the intrinsic plasticity with respect to the processes employed in goal-directed self-determination entails a diversity of such processes. But on the other hand, what lets the causal theorist off the hook is, on Hegel's view; a fundamentally distinct and irreducible conception of productivity:  To see this, consider another version of the example of the waiter who wants to startle his employer: One can imagine a situation in which the waiter feels his nervousness coming on, and recognizes it as a technique that might be exploited to do what he might otherwise not have the nerve to do. He refrains from controlling his nervousness and instead lets it play out next to the stack of glasses. The glasses are spilled and the employer is startled. In that case, I think we would say that the waiter intentionally startled his employer; even though the causal chain is non-standard, it is not deviant in the relevant sense. What accounts for the difference between this case and Wilson's case, in which the nervousness is a deviant chain?  Locating the difference in an additional causal chain of a certain sort is unlikely to help (e.g. control from some higher-order mental state), because that chain as well can either be employed or not by the directed activity in question. But this is the to the answer: the waiter in this second example acts intentionally because the control of the intention is represented by the plasticity with which the realization of that intention is pursued, and the way in which new means are recognized when present themselves.29 That is, the plasticity is a way of talking about the way in which the purpose illuminates the context and presents processes as means; this is the cunning of reason. And notice that it does so by introducing the interaction of and context in the way that Anscombe's account of the relation between intentional descriptions suggested. This suggests that Anscombe's myriad patterns for the relation of intentions to actions might be understood as variations on the basic form of the teleological relation. point goalkey they goals\n\nA complaint about a contemporary teleological account can help to further bring out the interest of Hegel's account here: In commenting on that teleological considerations explain only facts, not events actions,and these actions track an objective relation between reasons and actions that constitute those actions as intentional : Causation is a 30 Now; Hegel does not share these intuitions about cicher teleology or causa tion, In egct, Hegel holds that teleology promises a better articulation of the individuality of its relata than mechanism does, and it is interesting to see why 31 specific general singular singular\n\nNow insofar as end is this total reflection of objectivity into itself and is SO immediately, in the first place; the selfdetermination or particularity as simple self is distinct from the concrete form, and is a determinate reflection into although in respect of its form it is content.

For example, when we say of someone that he has a on his shoulder; part of what we mean is that he is looking to constitute external events as insults to which he can respond, and even though he does not realize this fact, it is clear to others who then try to avoid saying or anything that could be construed as a slight to him. This is a classic case in which the non-intentional background of intentional behavior is 'behind the herself only by breakdowns such as alienating contexts oppressive factory work) where the dominance ofone in constituting the context results in failure of agency due to other inability to form their context in this way: In these breakdowns, subconscious strategies for making the world into the context of our acour tions are revealed precisely through their unexpected ineffectiveness. Hegel, might expect, holds that the true teleological relation must make this %oroing and sorting explicit: That is, it must show that forming and sorting to be positing an active contribution of the agent\\_rather than merely a presupposing\\_a passive receptivity to a given fact: Thus a theoretical problem for the notion of expression is made into practical problem for individual expressers (whether agents or single-celled organisms). Or; to put it in terms of Hegelian phenomenology; the implicit contribution of the subject's self: understanding is thematized and thus made into part of the problem that the action is attempting to solve. In so the problem becomes not a form of skepticism to be refuted but a potentially alienating element that is to be managed. doing agent (e.g agent's goals agents' one doing,\n\nOn Hegel's view; if the end is to be truly immanent; it must take on its full character in the processes that constitute the means as an object; these its activity; the process of its objective realization. Even though the end is are to be conceived as directing the process of engagement with its context; the nonetheless the end to external conditions. These conditions process exposes create an intelligible distinction between an internal, basic character of the end and the more particular form of its external realization; are the way in which the teleological idea differentiates itself from its own expression. This happens only in the engagement of the means by the end, but may easily the illusion that there must be some prior end acting mechanically generate on the means. It is precisely to combat this illusion that Hegel differentiates teleology from force and cause: they and The end [Zweck] is therefore the subjective concept as striving drive to posit itself externally: End may indeed also be defined as force and essential\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncause; but these expressions fulfill only an incomplete side of its significance; if they are to be predicated ofit as it truly is, can be predicated only in a way that supersedes their concept: as a force that solicits itself to externalization, as a cause; which is the cause of itself or whose effect is immediately cause. # they\n\nTeleological production is therefore clearly intended by Hegel to be a replacement for the notion of a self-cause that has played such an important role in understandings of agency: But more to the point, the intensive interaction between and causal context effectively rebuts the charge that purposes can only explain facts instead of specific events, since the explanatory purposes evolve to be specifically related to the action they explain during the process of its production. The problem of explaining particular actions arises only if we treat such purposes as what Hegel would term abstract universals\\_ But on Hegel's view; this is a conception more ap: propriate to the covering laws of purportedly singular connections than to internal purposiveness . quite goal general quite causal\n\nThis point is important for understanding the differences between causation and teleological productivity as a model of action. One might think that -term would be best represented as abstract universals, e.g. survival Or reproduction, and thus that the abstract/ singular distinction was independent of the causal law/goal-directedness distinction. But the explanations of specific actions-and a fortiori of long-term projects-will be more satisfying to the extent that, e.g survival in a particular way as a particular kind of person is invoked as an explanation, and this points to the fact that the realization of such general modifies and specifies them such that, at best, the general term is just a shorthand reference to the more form of the But this recursive transformation of the in context makes the unilinear picture of causation under covering laws inapt as a general description of the kind of productivity at issue. If Hegel is right about this, then goal-directed productivity cannot be articulated as any specific and distinct kind of causal process , and on this point Hegel has common cause with Wright in rejectthe reduction of teleology to efficient causal mechanisms 3 For Hegel, the important contrast is the local, minimally diachronic causal linkage as opposed to the global, more fully diachronic systematic orientation of the pattern of causal linkages.   The systematic orientation of the system itself changes through its realizations of the (and the frustration of attempts at realization) this is why the plasticity of the system is an articulation of this recursiveness\\_but this change cannot necessarily be represented in the abstract as adoption of one kind of causal chain as to anlong; goals goals specific goal. goal ing goal opposed specific other (though such a change may be involved if such would be an appropriate technique for the reorientation of the system) change\n\nTo realize our ends, we use our bodies as means in mechanical relations to other objects. But this action on the world has a reaction on us and changes Us, and in turn modifies our ends. As this recursive process continues the end and the means are further and further integrated into each other; so that what begins in infancy as a relatively external relation between the body and purposes can develop into tighter fit. The case in which ones end is realized exactly as planned is just a limit case of this schema (both in theory and in practice) .  Even when the end is perfectly realized, it is still changed in the sense that its realization puts it into connection with a host of conditions and events surrounding the action. Ifthe plan is perfect; then this just means that the agent completely put the end into relation with such conditions in the planning process, thus transforming the end internally in anticipation of the resources and contingencies that would be encountered in the external world. But such a perfectly planned and realized end is a limit case-not the paradigm The paradigm cases are those in which we modify our ends both beforehand in anticipation of the context of externalization; and then subsequently as our knowledge or control of that context turns out to be imperfect. I plan, for example; an itinerary for family trip into account the usual weather for this time of year and my children's current nap schedules, but then this must be adjusted on the fly if the weather changes drastically or my toddler poorly the night before. This reciprocal interaction between and context can go either way; of course. Ifthe changes much more than the taking sleeps goal goal\n\nIn this way, Hegel's view has important advantages over Rowland Stout's contemporary teleological view of agency; which similarly holds that the deviant causal chains are deviant because eliminate teleological processes by introducing an element that is not sensitive to the means-end relation. In Stout's causal chains which can be broken down into component events are distinguished from causal processes that, though require \"a certain kind of structure of stages to occur; at any one moment when process is happening, what is happening is the whole process, not just part of it.\"36 Stout then defines a 'mechanism as \"a persisting; selfstanding, entity within the underlying conditions of a process that has the capacity either to undergo or to cause the characteristic stages of that process.\"31 To deal with cases of deviant causal chains, Stout wants to include the condithey theory they\n\ntions that constitute non-interference as part of the underlying nature of the process, so that it is clear that the interference present in the deviant chain cases ends the relevant teleological process and thus erases agency from the event: 38 But this inclusion of a non-interference condition within the essential properties of the process is implausible both because of the necessity of interference or resistance in some form or other,39 and because it therefore to rule out the need for the plasticity and persistence that is central appears to any teleological process. This explains why plasticity and persistence\\_fall out of Stouts account in favor of a less substantive sensitivity to the The former; however; is a messier but more informative and intuitive account of teleological processes: So, for example, Stout is forced to distinguish between the process ofthe sun warming up the stone (if there is nothing to interfere) and the process of the sun stopping the stone from cooling down (if a cool: wind interferes with the former process) But it is deeply counterintuitive to individuate processes in this way; given the omnipresence of interfering conditions in the real world, this method of individuation would multiply basic processes beyond all reason. goal ing\n\nThe basic problems that Stout faces concern the relation between structure and its underlying conditions; in Hegelian terms, between an essence and its appearance; or between the idea and the context of its expression. On the one hand, Stout has the insight that interference can change the nature of a process. But on the other hand, his concern to establish the continuous presence of an underlying condition leads him to argue that such a change results in a completely new process.4 As à result, the elasticity in Hegel's sense, of goaloriented activity is effectively denied .  This also comes out in the way that events happening during a process are ruled out for that reason by Stout as inputs to the process; which is another deeply counterintuitive consequence of his characterization of processes.4 In addition, by Stout's own admission, his insistence on the selfstanding nature of the mechanism means that the capacities that it grounds are understood much more broadly than is normal that not only the watch but also the spring within it has the capacity to tell the time) . This is essentially the problem of the arbitrariness of individuation that Hegel holds follows the false (because rigid) independence of mechanisms. If Hegel is right that the end that specifies the basic character of a teleological process and the means that represents the developed articulation of that character reciprocally interact with each other; then he has a (e.g from mechanism without either of the two counterintuitive results of Stout's view (the fragility of processes in the face of interference and the over-extension of the concept of mechanism), both of which follow from the rigidity of independence on Stout's conception.\n\n&lt;We can see Hegel's avoidance of the second problem (the over-extension of the concept of mechanism) by using these ideas to address the example of the watch. On Hegel's view, we to individuate the watch as a whole as the mechanism to tell time rather than just the spring because the watch as whole includes means to adjust the functioning of the watch to maintain correct time in the face of variable circumstances, whereas the spring itself ought\n\nHegel's avoidance of the first result is just his inclusion of plasticity and persistence in the nature of a teleological process, as described above: It is only in those cases in which the interference overwhelms the capacity of the teleological process to maintain its goalorientation that we should think of the teleological process as and thus, in the case of agency; the causal chain as being deviant rather than intentional . So, for example; in Wilson's original case of the waiter who accidentally startles his employer because he becomes nervous at the thought of doing the fuller picture of the waiter's psychology will be dominated by causal chains that tend to either avoid the result or bring it about in a different way at a different time. The causal chain that extends from the desire to startle to the startling through the nervousness is therefore deviant both in the sense that it contrasts with the preponderance of the agent's orientation and in the sense that nervousness that is the link in the chain is actually a byproduct of the contrary desires to avoid the startling or to execute it at another time. In the modified example; the agent recognizes this function of the nervousness and then the preponderance of his psychology would be directed at non-interference with this mechanism Or indirect nurturing of it (fanning the flames of his nervousness, to mix metaphors). Of course, the possibility of self-deception muddies the waters here, but the criterion for distinguishing deviant from standard intentional chains is the systematic orientation ofthe agents intentional stance, including those causal chains that are not directly productive of the action. The same recognizing his nervousness and mobilizing resources to combat it (breathe deeply, think thoughts), where these attempts to stop the nervousness are ineffective or backfire: In the second case; that recognition is followed by the opposite response; which is further develop that nervousness . ending, SO, key happy\n\ndoes So the watch as a whole is plastic and persistent with respect to the not of telling time if the functioning of the watch modifies itself to track the of correct time; or it is individuated as the key physical artifact human of telling time by virtue of the way that it affords the of the process wearer the opportunity to make such adjustments herself: In the first case; the of the watch. watch tells the time; and in the second we tell the time by means goal telling goal formulate teleological If this is right, then it makes sense to a Hegelian reorientaaccount that sees agency in the plastic and persistent goal-directed the dynamic pattern of those chains. tion of causal chains, as represented by modal theory that possibilities be Though it is important to Hegel's own of action, and thus that the distincrepresented as actualities in the context tions in responses to circumstances that distinguish goaloriented processes from another; are primarily causal ones, and one goal-oriented process conceived globally and diachronically as the differential response to present framework nonetheless but diverse and changing conditions, Hegel's general from the provides constructive way of thinking about these possibilities of analytic perspective, which emphasizes counterfactuals as a way bringing be developed in the significance of alternate possibilities.

If this is not to be a bare counterfactual, we need to tell some story of how the reason is actually related to the action so that the being\n\ncounterfactual receives some support. To provide such a categorical basis for the counterfactual the Causalist may simply appeal to the relation between attitudinal reason and action causal\n\nRoth   argues, the teleological   relation   will not support such specific counterfactuals. It strikes me that from Hegelian perspective, there are at least two difficulties with this argument. The first is that it seems incredible that simply appealing to the idea of a causal relation as support for a counterfactual gives any insight into that counterfactual or leaves it any less bare than before. In fact, it seems more likely that the counterfactuals will inform our understanding of the causal relation  Second, it is well known that the causal relation cannot be understood as a necessary condition the lines assumed by Roth, since over-determination cases are unavoidable counterexamples. Just as one bomb may have caused the collapse of a house before a second bomb had a chance to do the same, Lisa may also have wanted desire that would have caused her to go for a bike ride in the absence of her desire to exercise, but was not causally active in the face of that desire: But, along\n\nBy contrast; explanation by purposes does support counterfactuals, and in a much more relevant sense than even the purported one that we have just seen to fail. This is what distinguishes the normal case of the assassin the target through a direct shot from Davidson's example of the stampeding pigs: achieving the ofkilling the target is more certain and exposed to contingency through the direct shot, and so it is easier to see it as an example of trying to kill the target.  We therefore believe that the shooter who instead startled the pigs would have compensated for whatever error or circumstance caused her to miss; had she been made aware of it beforehand.45 This is a counterfactual that ties the agent to her context in virtue of her competencea way of talking about her skills as means and thus is a counterfactual that articulates a 46 substantial element of our understanding of agency: It does not, of course, have the logical simplicity of Roth's suggested counterfactual, but I take it to be the Hegelian judgment that it is none the worse off for it. killing goal less\n\nThese two Hegelian theses-the significance ofthe means and the necessary transformation of the end\\_articulate the of self-determination as elasticity: In the contemporary understanding; they are ways of understanding the plasticity and persistence with respect to the that defines all directed behavior as the way in which the selects behaviors that conduce to its realization. And it is this conception of plasticity and persistence that shape goal goalgoal\n\nof teleological production; and provides the content of the positive account thus also a way of distinguishing intentional from deviant causal chains:\n\nFinally, since plasticity and persistence are related to the way in which does specifically as an account of embedded agency It does so because the SO theorist primarily serves as the condiexternal context that for the causal tions under which the beliefs and desires that cause action are formed plays a more expanded role in Hegels account of productivity and a role which is more in line with interpretivist theories The diversity and meaningfulness that Anscombe so powerfully makes central to of natural and social context substantial the understanding and explanation of action are organized by a articulation of the force of the 'because' in action explanations by reasons or intentions, and an articulation that is, broadly speaking, productive in the that the causal theorist expects. In Hegel's theory; context plays the role way of the development of intentions, but this development is of the condition recursive; and occurs just as much through the influence of the context on the realization of the intention as in its influence on the initial formation of the intention (ifthis latter process is considered to be something contrastively internal and subjective). It is a model of productivity that therefore embeds the medium of the selfdevelopment of her own the agent in her context as goals, and thus embeds the context in the agent as a system of means for selfexpression. In this way, relatively external purposes that begin either as abstractly subjective or as merely given by natural or social features of the be internalized through the continual working of the on context can that such internalization be successful-this the context. It is not necessary teleological account makes the problem of alienation central concern in the theory of agency; and this is particularly apparent in Hegel's discussions in the Phenomenology: But the account also holds out the possibility of grounding theory of free will as the non-alienated experience of nature a of at home and community which must surely be Hegel's conception with oneself in the other;47 goals goal being\n\n## NOTES\n\n- 1 .

This criterion of non-observational knowledge is plausibly interpreted in terms of a strict introspectability of the relevant reasons for an action, which is then put to use in rejection of the causal view through the plausible observation that for a number of paradigmatically intentional actions, there simply is no introspectable reason-state (a desire or belief) to serve as the cause of the action. (See Rosalind Hursthouse, \"Intention, pp. 86-88.) But the strictness of that criterion has seemed overly high a bar to many. Davidson, Those who have that there are no mental events to qualify as causes of actions have often missed the obvious because they have insisted that a mental event be observed or noticed (rather than an observing or a noticing)\" (Davidson, Essays, p. 12). This is connected with the fact that Davidson denies that the belief or desire is, strictly speaking, an event at all or need be in order to play its role in the event-causal story: In any event, Anscombe's clearest presentation ofhow an intention is non-observational knowledge is in terms of a kind of formal priority of maker's knowledge over its performance, formulation grounded in Aquinas's characterization of practical knowledge as 'the cause of what it understands, which brings us around full circle to the question of the productivity of action, even though this cause is not to be understood as a mere extra feature of events causal large argued\n\n- 9 Anscombe,  Intention, S26.

Anscombe herself rejects what she considers to be the restriction of her view to teleological account, in claiming that Aristotle's understanding exceeds our own in allowing at least for four kinds of causes-and yet even four is not enough (\"The Causation of Action,\" in Knowledge and Mind, ed.

But if Hegel is right that in general mechanical systems of causal interaction are individuated only by reference to the ends that they manifest, then there is every reason to approach agency from this perspective.

Roth then proposes 'situational environmentalist\" account in which singular causal relation is posited between the action and a mental state in which contextual are represented. Thus the mental state forges an explanatory tie between the action and its circumstances, and thus provides a way of accounting for complex action over time and in context. Though very suggestive, Roth's positive account is not well developed in this article. Indeed, it is not clear that it extends at all beyond Davidson's original account, in which beliefs about the environment and desires for the realization of certain are conditions that combine with paradigmatic precisely those homeostatic systems that Davdison also understands as models of the causal power of free will (\"Reasons Explanations of Actions: Causal, Singular; and 839-74, 852) features goals\n\n- 31 .

This transformation, from the Schellingean language of intuition and Indifferenz to his own conception of self-consciousness as negativity, is the indirect concern of this paper: My main purpose here is to go further back, before the Frankfurt period, to uncover dimension of Hegel's early thinkthat played a major role in that final phase of his development almost a decade later: A central, and still rather puzzling dimension of the final turn is a thorough reintegration of the standpoint of the autonomous individual into the social conception of Spirit. ' The autonomous agent of conscience appears in a very prominent place in the Phenomenology; namely at the end of the Spirit\" chapter; where this conceptual figure is the historically latest and systematically most advanced of Spirit.

The main claims identify the core problem (distinguishing intentional from non-intentional actions) and Hegel's proposed solution through teleological goal-directedness. The supporting premises explain how goal-directed behavior works through systematic orientation and plasticity in pursuing means to ends. The example of the waiter demonstrates how this framework can distinguish intentional from deviant causal chains based on the systematic orientation of the agent's intentional stance.",
