Wolfe Centre for History of Science, Dept. of Philosophy and Moral Sciences Ghent University ctwolfe1@gmail.com forthcoming in Ohad Nachtomy and Justin E.H. Smith, eds., The Life Sciences in Early Modern Philosophy , OUP\n\nDenis  Diderot's  natural  philosophy  is  deeply  and  centrally  'biologistic':  as  it  emerges between the 1740s and 1780s, thus right before the appearance of the term 'biology' as a way of designating a unified science of life (McLaughlin), his project is motivated by the desire both to understand the laws governing organic beings and to emphasize, more 'philosophically', the uniqueness of organic beings within the physical world as a whole. This is apparent both in the metaphysics of vital matter he puts forth in works such as D'Alembert's Dream (1769) and the more empirical concern with the mechanics of life in his manuscript Elements of Physiology , on which he worked during the last twenty years of  his  life.  This  'biologism'  obviously  presents  the  interpreter  of  Diderot  with  some difficulties,  notably  as  regards  his  materialism,  given  that  contemporary  forms  of materialism  have  on  the  contrary  strongly  rejected  notions  of  emergence,  vitalism, teleology and any concepts appealing to unique, irreducible features of organisms. In response, some have described him as a 'holist' (Kaitaro) while others have emphasized his  materialist,  naturalist  project  (Bourdin,  Wolfe).  In  what  follows  I  examine  a  littleknown aspect of Diderot's articulation of his biological project: his statement in favour of  epigenesis  within  the  short but  suggestive Encyclopédie article  'Spinosiste.'  Diderot was, of course, a partisan of epigenesis (the developmental-biological theory opposed to preformation, according to which beings develop by successive adjunction of layers of matter), but why  include a statement in favour of a particular biological (or developmental) theory within an entry dealing with a philosopher, Spinoza, who does not seem to have been concerned at all with the specific properties of living beings, how they  grow  from  embryonic  to  developed  states,  and  so  on?  By  trying  to  answer  this question I also try and locate Diderot's biological project in relation to what will become, in the years after his death, the project for a science called 'biology', with figures such as Treviranus  and  Lamarck.  For  it  is  not  clear  that  the  two  can  be  easily  correlated  or causally  linked:  Diderot's  'epigenetic  Spinozism'  is  a  different  conceptual  entity  from what we find in histories of biology.\n\n*  An earlier version of this paper was presented at the Early Modern Medicine and Natural Philosophy conference, Center for Philosophy of Science, University of Pittsburgh, November 2012. I am grateful to the participants for their comments.\n\n1.\n\nDenis Diderot's natural philosophy is deeply and centrally 'biologistic': as it emerges in the mid-eighteenth century, thus right before the appearance of the term 'biology' as a way of designating a unified science of life, his project is motivated by the desire both to understand the laws governing organic beings and to emphasize, more 'philosophically', the uniqueness of organic beings within the physical world as a whole. In what follows I examine a little-known aspect of Diderot's articulation of his project: his statement in favour of biological epigenesis within the short but suggestive Encyclopédie article 'Spinosiste.' 1  What possible relation could there be between Spinozism and epigenesis? Between a metaphysics of substance and modes which, even if it is also a major statement of philosophical naturalism, says almost nothing about biological entities, and a fashionable embryological theory of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries? 2\n\nA difficulty in many histories of biology, or works focusing on the so-called history and philosophy of biology (such as Grene and Depew's 'episodic history' 3 ) is that they flatten out the series of theories, positions, and controversies therein, in a rather linear fashion: preformationism versus epigenesis, Harvey versus Descartes on circulation, Bernard on the milieu intérieur and so on. In contrast, my concern is not so much to stress innate complexity or the non-linearity of any particular context (whether\n\n1  Denis Diderot, 'Spinosiste.' Enc . Vol. XV (1765): 474a. On the emergence of biology as such, see Joseph Caron, ''Biology' in the Life Sciences: A Historiographical Contribution,' History of Science n° 26 (1988): 223-268; Peter McLaughlin, 'Naming biology,' Journal of the History of Biology vol. 35 (2002): 14; Guido Barsanti, 'Lamarck: Taxonomy and Theoretical Biology,' Asclepio vol. 52 n° 2 (2000): 119-131.\n\n2  Sometimes the conatus is presented as a 'vital force', a 'survival principle' within the organism which leads it to seek to persevere in its existence; or Spinoza is interpreted as an 'organicist' (this is notably Hans Jonas's claim in 'Spinoza and the Theory of Organism,' Journal of the History of Philosophy vol. 3 (1965): 43-57; reprinted in Jonas, The Phenomenon of Life. Towards a Philosophical Biology [New York: Harper &amp; Row / Dell, 1966]). But, as François Duchesneau showed, it is a mistake to make such a sharp distinction between Cartesian mechanism and Spinozism: the conatus is itself a mechanical relation between the activity of one individual and others (Duchesneau, 'Modèle cartésien et modèle spinoziste de l'être vivant,' Cahiers Spinoza 2 (1978), 273).\n\n3  Marjorie Grene, David Depew, The philosophy of biology: an episodic history (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004).\n\nin the form 'Paracelsus was right!' or the counter-factual, 'what if midwives had succeeded in their efforts to be recognized and form a Royal College'?), but to point out - here, with respect to epigenesis in its 'materialist' appropriation - that other factors, interests and intentions are at work, which do not fit well either into a history of discoveries, or of a catalogue of theoretical background positions implicit in the naturalist's practice. These sorts of factors are both ideological and metaphysical; they are often highlighted, in contrast, in histories organized around ideas such as 'the radical Enlightenment'. 4  But such histories have very little to say about the integral relation between such radicalism and the shifts in the life sciences, for they focus on heterodoxy, politics and of course philosophical polemics at the expense of naturalistic concerns (an exception being Ann Thomson's work, which seeks to tell a more unified story 5 ). To be fair, the existence of a 'vital materialism' has been emphasized in recent scholarship (although the term goes at least as far back as the 1960s, with Jean Wahl and Yvon Belaval 6 ). But this still leaves out the clandestine, radical dimension: the fascination with generation, species or 'vital minima' is neither just the expression of prodromes or rough drafts of a future normalized science (as presented, typically, in works such as Forerunners of Darwin 7 ), nor a merely ideological construct 'on top of' historical, socio-cultural discourses.\n\nEpigenesis has been many things to many people. Most generically, it is the embryological theory that 'organs . . . are progressively formed from, or emerge from, an\n\n4  Jonathan Israel, Radical Enlightenment.

Jean Wahl describes Diderot as a 'vitalist materialist' and the Leibnizian philosopher of nature JeanBaptiste Robinet as a 'materialist vitalist' ( Tableau de la philosophie française [Paris: Gallimard, 1962], 53, 54). Yvon Belaval suggests that Diderot's non-mechanistic materialism, which brings him close to vitalist insights (of the non-supernaturalist variety), should be described as 'un vitalo-chimisme ou un chimio-vitalisme ': 'Sur le matérialisme de Diderot,' In Europäische Aufklärung.

In that sense, to focus on the case of epigenesis in just about any context in the seventeenth or eighteenth centuries is to be confronted with a total breakdown of any convenient distinction between 'experimental' and 'speculative'\n\n8  C.U.M.

This can sound 'vitalistic', which is a danger for a Kantian. Kant cites Maupertuis' molecules 'endowed with intelligence' (and desire, aversion and memory)  as a major example of the dangers of hylozoism in Der einzig mögliche Beweisgrund zu einer Demonstration des Daseins Gottes , cit. in John Zammito, 'Kant's early views on epigenesis: The role of Maupertuis,' in The problem of animal generation in early modern philosophy , ed.

This is for instance how the mortalist physician William Coward appropriates both Harvey and Glisson (Ann Thomson, 'Encore l'âme matérielle,' La Lettre clandestine vol. 14 (2006), 64-65; Bodies of Thought: Science, Religion, and the Soul in the Early Enlightenment (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008), 113). Similarly, a metaphysics of vital properties - and the question of whether the physiologist should be concerned with it - appears in the controversy between Robert Whytt and Albrecht von Haller on irritability, in which Diderot appropriates both but sounds more like the former philosophically (François Duchesneau, 'Diderot et la physiologie de la sensibilité,' Dix-huitième siècle 31 (1999): 195-216; C.T.

Granted, Harvey does hold in the Generation of Animals that living things, 'as soon as they are endowed with life, . . . suffice for their own nourishment and increase, and this in virtue of peculiar inherent forces, innate, implanted from the beginning,' 18 and he speaks frequently in this work of a vis plastica . 19  He defines epigenesis as the 'addition of the parts that successively arise,' 'the superaddition of parts . . . out of the power or potentiality of the pre-existent matter ( ex potentia materiae pre-existentis ).' 20  But Harvey is not interested in extrapolating from his analysis of the formation of the egg, to the metaphysics of life and matter itself, or better, even if he makes partly Aristotelian extensions from the embryological context towards the nature of life itself, his observations and interpretations are not founded on or interrelated with an ontology of Life (in contrast to Glisson, but also to Diderot's 'Spinozist' construct I will discuss below).\n\n2.\n\nHow is it that this theory, epigenesis, becomes part and parcel of a vital materialism?\n\n16  D e generatio animalium . . . , Exercitatione 52, in Works , 381, and cf. 373, 376 and all of Exercitatione 71, 'On Innate Heat.'\n\n17  Walter Pagel, 'William Harvey: Some Neglected Aspects of Medical History,' Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes vol. 7 (1944), 147.\n\n18  Harvey, Exercitationes de generatio animalium . . . , Ex. 27, in Works , 281.\n\n19  Harvey, De generatione animalium , preface, 'De methodo in cognitione generationis adhibenda'; vis plastica is translated as 'plastic force' or 'plastic power' by R. Willis, in his 1843 edition of Harvey's works. Antonine Nicoglou has counted 23 references to 'vis plastica' in this work. See her thesis in progress, 'La plasticité du vivant : une analyse épistémologique,'Université de Paris-1 / IHPST.\n\n20  Harvey, De generatione animalium , Ex. 51, 45,  in Works , 372, 335.\n\nFor once we get to Maupertuis and Diderot, moving past the impasses reached by preformationist theory, whether ovist or animalist, we find older examples, e.g. ones given already by Harvey, being presented by Maupertuis in the Vénus physique in order to assert epigenesis, in the context of a conception of matter as endowed with vital, selforganizing properties: a vital, non-mechanistic materialism. We can call this position materialism , in that epigenesis as a theory recognizes in nature the power of selfformation as something material. But it was vital in that its proponents (notably Maupertuis) argued that the mechanical principles of physics did not suffice to account for embryo growth and the formation of organisms ('organized bodies') overall. Reflecting on this process of growth, Maupertuis stated that Newtonian attraction does not sufficiently account for organic phenomena, or even 'the simplest chemical operations' 21 ; this force alone cannot properly account for the production of specifically organized bodies : 'A blind, uniform attraction distributed throughout the parts of matter would not explain how these parts arrange themselves to form even the simplest organized body. . . . Why shouldn't they unite at random? ( Pourquoi ne s'unissent-elles pas pêle-mêle ? )' 22\n\nNotice that if the theory of epigenesis now explicitly involves the capacity of matter to self-organize, so that complexity emerges out of material processes alone, we are no longer in a strictly biological context. In that sense, again reflecting elements of the story that we will not find in a history of biology (or biological thought), it is important to notice how scandalous the doctrine can be. Diderot's statement of epigenesis as Spinozism will be my key case of this scandalousness, but examples can be found quite earlier. For instance, in the early 1700s Samuel Clarke attacks Anthony Collins for this view, declaring that\n\nIt being as impossible that the organized Body of a Chicken should by the power of any Mechanical Motions be formed out of the unorganized Matter of an Egg;\n\n21  Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis, Système de la nature.

Lyon: Bruyset, 1756), § III, 141.\n\n22  Maupertuis, Système , § XIV, 146-147; Wolfe, 'Endowed molecules and emergent organization.'\n\nas that the Sun Moon and Stars, should by mere Mechanism arise out of a Chaos. 23\n\n## Collins had argued that\n\nthe Matter of which an Egg consists, doth intirely constitute the young one, and that the Action of Sensation began under a particular Disposition of the Parts by Motion, without the Addition of an Immaterial and Immortal Soul, as the Powers of Vegetation, Gravitation, of producing the Sensation of Heat, Cold, Red, Blue, Yellow,  are  performed  without  the  Addition  of  an  Immaterial  and  Immortal Soul . 24\n\nAs with Harvey and Glisson, it is not easy here to separate the strictly medical or 'biological' content of a theory, and the ideologically charged, polemical but also metaphysically speculative dimension. This is also apparent in Thomas Willis' 'pyrotechnic' account of generation. Willis was only trying to bring together chemistry, anatomy and physiology to produce an integrated model of brain function and cognitive processes, without materialist intentions, but Henry More attacked him for what he called 'Psychopyrism' 25 : he felt that 'according to [Willis] the production of a Soul ex Traduce, would end in meer Materialism,' 26  with the explicitly epigenetic dimension being that 'in Generation some matter only is newly modified.' 27  And indeed, Willis had spoken of the 'Vital Humour in an Egg.' 28  In the eighteenth century, we also find epigenetic concepts either being used with deliberate philosophical -materialist overtones, or as experimental/medical concepts, again with some overlap between the two. The physician Abraham Gaultier's semi-clandestine treatise Parité de la vie et de la mort (1714) puts forth an emergentist concept of matter, medically inspired\n\n23  Clarke, 'Letter to Mr. Dodwell [for Anthony Collins]'( Second Defence of the Immateriality and Immortality of the Soul ), in Clarke, The Works of Samuel Clarke , 4 vols., 1738 (reprint, New York: Garland, 1978), III, 789.\n\n24  Collins, A Reply to Mr Clarke's Defence of his Letter to Mr Dodwell , in Clarke, Works , III, 768.\n\n25  See his 1682 'A Letter to a Learned Psychopyrist'; John Henry, 'Medicine and Pneumatology: Henry More, Richard Baxter, and Francis Glisson's Treatise on the Energetic Nature of Substance ,' Medical History vol. 31 (1987), 34.\n\n26 Joseph Glanvil, Henry More, Sadducismus triumphatus: or, A full and plain evidence concerning witches and apparitions (1681; London: A.

Pordage (London: Dring, Harper and Leigh, 1683), 33.\n\nand with frequent recourse to epigenetic concepts. 29  When the vitalist physician Théophile de Bordeu reflects on the nature of 'cellular substance', he describes a gradual shift from a kind of vital glue, a mucous, nutritive substance, to sheaths of muscular fibre, solely by material superaddition. 30\n\nTo take stock for a moment, these various examples, from More on Willis and Clarke on Collins to later medical theories and the debate between Maupertuis and Diderot, show (i) that a theory about generation is intertwined with shifts in matter theory, and (ii) that this intertwinement has a radical dimension, sensu Israel (whose analysis of the Radical Enlightenment, 31  however, tends to steer clear of the sciences) for epigenesis is not a metaphysically dangerous theory when Harvey introduces it in 1651. There are other, better-known cases that also combine these elements: the example of the polyp, which fascinated a generation of European scientists, was explicitly taken by Charles Bonnet as an exciting but dangerous challenge to the existence of the soul, or at least of a single, indivisible soul in the body. One could also mention the anatomicometaphysical study of monsters, or the concern with species and miscegenation in this period. 32  But the articulation of epigenesis and materialism shows us something else again, at this intersection of radicalism and the new focus on the emergent life sciences. And the sharpest, most distinctive form this takes is in Diderot's Spinozism.\n\n3.\n\nDiderot's biological project is inseparable from claims which are not themselves restrictively biological; he is the proponent of a (programmatic) Spinozist biology. Diderot was not a physician like La Mettrie, or a 'working natural historian' like Buffon; but one of his first publications was the translation of Robert James' Medicinal Dictionary\n\n29 Abraham Gaultier, Parité de la vie et de la mort .

Rather than having a specifically medical or medico-philosophical focus, Diderot is concerned with 'natural history', by which he means the study of the nature of life as a whole, including its ontological status (whereby natural history has a specifically materialist dimension 35 ).\n\nThe latter dimension is apparent when Diderot moves within one sentence, as in his speculative, experimental work the Rêve de D'Alembert (1769), from a statement of epigenesis in the restrictive sense, to claims such as 'Do you see this egg? It is with this egg that we can overturn all schools of theology.' 36  This idiosyncratic combination comes in different prose forms, in Diderot: sometimes in enlightened commentaries on experimental science ( Pensées sur l'interprétation de la nature , Principes philosophiques sur la matière et le mouvement , Éléments de physiologie ), sometimes in more speculative forms, which are harder to categorize (particularly the Lettre sur les aveugles and Le Rêve de D'Alembert ); the latter has been described as Diderot's 'science-fiction'. In both of these sorts of works, Diderot is haunted or rather fascinated by the nature of living beings their capacity to transform, to produce monsters, to return to life when the substance\n\n33 Diderot attended Guillaume-François Rouelle's chemistry lectures at the Jardin du Roi (now the Jardin des Plantes), between 1754 and 1757, and served as secretary during many of the lectures, taking notes and even preparing some of the lectures for Rouelle, which were first published as Introduction à la chymie, manuscrit inédit de Diderot publié avec une notice sur les cours de Rouelle , ed.

But on the other hand, his articulation of all of these in a materialist project does not belong or open onto an episode amongst others in the history of science. I shall try to make both of these aspects more clear by (i) situating Diderot's concern with 'biological life' in the context of the emergence of biology as a science, and then (ii) turning to what I term here his 'Spinozist biology'.\n\n## (i) Diderot's biologism and the emergence of 'biology'\n\nIn a dramatic section of his Pensées sur l'interprétation de la nature (1753-1754), Diderot seems to announce, more directly than in his usual, more metaphorical style, the advent of something like biology :\n\nWe are on the verge of a great revolution in the sciences. Given the taste people seem  to  have  for  morals, belles-lettres ,  the  history  of  nature  and  experimental physics, I dare say that before a hundred years, there will not be more than three great geometricians remaining in Europe. The science will stop short where the Bernoullis,  the  Eulers,  the  Maupertuis,  the  Clairaut,  the  Fontaines  and  the D'Alemberts will have left. . . . We will not go beyond. 38\n\nThis passage has rarely been commented on, and scholars who have tend to miss the radical dimension. Thus Paolo Casini only notices that Diderot is mistaken in his\n\n37  See Jacques Proust, 'Diderot et la philosophie du polype,' Revue des sciences humaines vol. 14 n° 182 (1981).\n\n38 Pensées sur l'interprétation de la nature , § IV, in Diderot, Œuvres complètes , IX, 30-31.\n\ndiagnosis of the situation of mathematics: 'This was a rather curious reaction in a period when the best continental mathematicians were active in solving so many problems left open in the Principia .' Somewhat closer to the point (but only in part), Casini does add that 'at this time the life sciences entered a period of rapid growth and needed a proper new method.' 39  Indeed, similar proclamations of the rise of life science together with a denial of the pertinence of the mechanical, physical and mathematical sciences can be found elsewhere, including the central article of the Encyclopédie , entitled 'Encyclopédie': 'Les esprits sont encore emportés d'un autre mouvement général vers l'histoire naturelle, l'anatomie, la chimie et la physique expérimentale.' 40 Similarly, Buffon stated in the first volume of his Histoire naturelle that 'mathematical truths are just abstractions of the mind, that are in no way real.' 41\n\nThis is science, or programmatic science, although it is antimathematical (and to be clear, Buffon the translator of Stephen Hales' Vegetable Staticks and Diderot the author of several essays on probabilities, were by no means mathematically ignorant). 42 Another example would be the medical vitalist focus on properties of organs (or muscles, such as irritability) which cannot be grasped mathematically (or at least are the object of failed calculations by iatromathematical physicians such as Keill and Borelli): a medical thesis on irritability defended at Montpellier in 1776 by a certain Mr 'D.G.' (who further research identifies as Jean Charles Marguerite Guillaume de Grimaud),\n\n39  Paolo Casini, 'Newton's 'Principia' and the Philosophers of the Enlightenment,' Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London 42:1 (1988), special issue on Newton's 'Principia' and Its Legacy , 44.\n\n40 Art. 'Encyclopédie,' in Diderot, Œuvres complètes , VII, 185. Analogous passages can be found in Diderot's letter to Voltaire of February 19 1758, and in Grimm's Correspondance littéraire , June 1 1765, vol. IV, 1, 649. The Encyclopédie article 'Histoire naturelle,' which is primarily by Diderot with some excerpts of Buffon, contains a reflection on trends and 'fashions in the sciences'; Diderot notes that the 'taste for abstract and mechanical sciences' replaced the taste for the study of antiquity, and that the former taste was in turn replaced by the taste for 'experimental science,' which itself is now losing ground to 'natural history' (an umbrella term for life science partly interchangeable with 'biology', as I discuss at greater length in ''Cabinet d'Histoire Naturelle''). But given this hauteur de vue , Diderot acknowledges - unlike thinkers we might think of as 'vitalists' or 'organicists' - that there is no reason why this biocentric focus might itself some day not be replaced by something else ('le règne de l'histoire naturelle aura-t-il aussi son terme ?') ( Enc. VIII, 1765, 228b).\n\n41 Georges-Louis-Marie-Leclerc de Buffon, 'De la manière d'étudier l'Histoire Naturelle,' in Histoire naturelle, générale et particulière , vol. 1 (Paris: Imprimerie Royale, 1749), 53.\n\n42 If needed expand on Diderot and Mandeville's anti-mathematicism.\n\ndiscusses properties of muscles but also 'animals' such as the polyp - both in terms of their contractility - in order to prove that the 'human machine,' the 'most complicated machine in the universe,' is not reducible to the simple, atomic, intellectual objects of mathematics … 43  But Diderot is neither a natural historian nor a professor of medicine. What is his relation then to these proclamations of the supremacy of the life sciences? Is he putting forth essayistic sketches of a proto-biology, or a philosophical materialism with a vital flavour, as indicated above? Let us consider each possibility in turn.\n\nIf we read Diderot as somehow an actor in the emergence of biology, forty-odd years before its official appearance (or an observer of this appearance, whether or not he was right in his predictions about geometry), the reader may object that this is anachronistic. Yet I do not think this is the real problem in such an identification. The standard view is that 'biology' as a term appears in the late 1790s, in works by Treviranus and Lamarck (roughly at the same time) 44 ; Lamarck planned for a long time to write a treatise entitled Biologie, ou Considérations sur la nature, les facultés, les développements et l'origine des corps vivants (in fact some of the manuscript, dated 1800, survives but it did not circulate; it was published for the first time in 1944). 45  Treviranus aimed not only to provide a precise compilation of the knowledge of his time, concerning the phenomena of life, but also a theoretical framework for this new scientific discipline he called biology, by combining philosophical and experimental analysis and information. 46   Less well known is that the term 'biology' occurs in the context of Naturphilosophie , in authors such as T.G.A. Roose, K.F. Burdach, and C.C.E.\n\n43  'D.G.' (Jean-Charles-Marguerite-Guillaume de Grimaud), Essai sur l'irritabilité (Avignon: Bonnet frères, 1776), 33, 35.\n\n44 G.R.

However, this does not capture his real motivations: he is not seeking to be a more materialist version of a Treviranus, or a Naturphilosoph . If we understood him thus, we would be neglecting the 'Spinozist' dimension of his thought, which is both more speculative and more radical. I've already noted that Diderot's interest (or even fascination ) in the nature of living beings, does not open onto biology as a (nascent) science , and indeed, does not aim at this development. As can be seen in the article 'Spinosiste' and the other texts cited below, Diderot is articulating a junction, a connection between traditional metaphysical considerations, experimental revelations on the nature of Life, and a new kind of philosophical project which is neither presenting itself as the foundation of the study of the natural world, nor as a friendly ancillary to such study.\n\n47 T.G.A.

It is positively articulated in two texts of very different nature: his short article 'Spinosiste' in the Encyclopédie (which is the most 'academic' presentation of the present theme, but also perhaps the most surprising) and a more speculative version of the same text, which we find in his 'experimental' work Le Rêve de D'Alembert ; it is negatively, or 'discursively' articulated in his polemic with Maupertuis, which occurs some 10-15 years earlier but which I shall discuss last. 50\n\nHere is the definition of a Spinozist given in the Encyclopédie (not to be confused with the long, more conventional entry on Spinoza, which is largely authored by the Abbé Yvon):\n\nSPINOSIST, s. m. ( Gram. ):  follower of the philosophy of Spinosa. One must not confuse the ancient Spinosists with the modern Spinosists . The general principle of the latter is that matter is sensitive; they demonstrate this by the development of the egg, an inert body which by the sole means [ instrument ]  of  graduated heat moves to the state of a sensing, living being, and by the growth of any animal which  in  its  inception  [ principe ]  is  merely  a  point,  and  through  the  nutritive assimilation  of  plants  and  -  in  one  word  -  of  all  substances  that  serve  the purpose  of  nutrition,  becomes  a  great  sensing  and  living  body  in  a  greater [expanse of] space. From this they conclude that only matter exists, and that it is sufficient to explain everything. For the rest, they follow ancient Spinosism in all of its consequences. 51\n\nThe juxtaposition (or articulation) is surprising: there are ancient and modern Spinozists, and what characterizes the latter is essentially their commitment to epigenesis. Now, Diderot was fascinated by 'the development of the egg' and related biological phenomena throughout his work, and he relates these to more metaphysical questions: the nature of matter, the possibility that all matter can sense ('is sensitive'), and the shift from a state of inertia to a state of sensibility, or from inert matter to\n\n50 Wolfe, 'Endowed molecules.'\n\n51 Diderot, 'Spinosiste,' Encyclopédie , vol. XV, 474a.\n\nsensing matter, as we see in the above passage and also in those from the Rêve I quote below. I hope it is clear that Diderot sees this as an inseparable relation between empirical phenomena (e.g., 'here are two quite common phenomena : . . . the development of the egg, this move from the state of inert matter to the state of sensing being . . . the return to life of some insects' 52 ) and a materialist doctrine in which the innate 'vitality' of matter demonstrates, or should demonstrate, the vacuity of any purported distinction between matter and thought, or matter and life. This vital dimension of Diderot's materialism is well known, along with the role played in his thought by the shifts - epistemological, experimental and other - in the 'proto-biology' of his time.\n\nBut why present this claim in the article 'Spinosiste'? In fact, very few commentators have asked why Diderot gives such an idiosyncratic definition of 'modern Spinozism.' To be sure, his convictions regarding living matter (or all of matter inasmuch as it is potentially living and sensing) are tied to his admiration for the metaphysics of a single substance composed of an infinite number of modes ('There is only one substance in the universe,' he states in the Rêve 53 ). But nowhere does Spinoza seek to connect his metaphysics to the life sciences; even if the notion of the conatus was frequently taken up in the generations after him to mean something like a survival impulse in living beings, this was not what he meant at all. 54  One of the few writers who did address my question (why should epigenesis be presented as the view of modern Spinozists ?), Paul Vernière, invented a category meant to cover such cases: 'neo-Spinozism' (which was partly controversial). He defined this as a form of holist materialism founded on the life sciences rather than on a priori metaphysical speculation:\n\n52  Diderot, Observations sur Hemsterhuis , in Œuvres , vol. 1 : Philosophie , ed. L. Versini (Paris: LaffontBouquins, 1994), 708.\n\n53 Rêve , in Œuvres complètes , XVII, 107.\n\n54  For an interesting way of reading Spinoza as a thinker of 'Life', however, see  Sylvain Zac, L'idée de vie dans la philosophie de Spinoza (Paris: PUF, 1963), especially ch. IV (as indicated earlier, Hans Jonas's essay 'Spinoza and the Theory of Organism' is less useful here). For the repercussions of 'Spinozism' as heuristic but also polemical construct in Enlightenment medicine and biophilosophy (e.g. in Boerhaave), see Annie Ibrahim, 'Sur le spinozisme dans les philosophies du vivant,' in Spinoza au XVIII e  siècle , ed. O. Bloch (Paris: Klincksieck, 1990) and for a more measured historical assessment, Giglioni, 'Whatever happened to Francis Glisson?', 485-486.\n\n'The neo-Spinozists are not abstract speculators but savants ; starting from precise experiments on embryogenesis and animal physiology, they claim to find in matter itself the laws governing the origin and development of life.' 55  The mystery surrounding the article 'Spinosiste' would then be dispelled: to be a neo-Spinozist is to seek to rearticulate a new form of (metaphysical) monism that would be in closer agreement with scientific data. But there is something odd about this definition, perhaps oddly neat in its way of demarcating a new form of science-friendly philosophical practice. For Diderot is quite willing to take statements of epigenesis into new territories which are neither inductively nor otherwise experimentally founded.\n\nWe can see this most clearly in one of his masterpieces, the experimental philosophical dialogue entitled Le Rêve de D'Alembert ( D'Alembert's Dream ), written in 1769, one copy of which was given by Diderot to Catherine the Great as a present. It is composed of three dialogues, of which the first two concern us here: in the first, the character Diderot debates the character D'Alembert on the nature of matter, thought and sensibility, and tries to convince the latter that all of these are really on a continuum. Shortly after D'Alembert has said to Diderot 'you have something against the distinction between the two substances,' Diderot asks, rather rhetorically,\n\nDo you see this egg? It is with this [egg] that we overturn all schools of theology and all the temples of the world. What is this egg? An unsensing mass prior to the introduction of the seed [ germe ]; and after the seed has been introduced, what is it then? An unsensing mass, for the seed itself is merely an inert, crude fluid. How will this  mass  move  to  another  [level  of]  organization,  to  sensibility  and life? By means of heat. What will heat produce therein? Movement. 56\n\nA lot is happening in this passage. To claim that 'it is with this [egg]' that 'all schools of theology' can be overturned is obviously to step outside of the controlled, empirical\n\n55  Vernière, Spinoza et la pensée française avant la Révolution (Paris: PUF, 1954, 2 nd  edition 1982), 529; he also describes Diderot (and Maupertuis) as neo-Spinozists in an editorial note to his edition of Diderot, Œuvres philosophiques (Paris: Garnier, 1961), 229.

We could call this an ideological or polemical moment (precisely illustrating what we have come to call the Radical Enlightenment); it is also, of course, a step towards philosophical materialism. Furthermore, it is a step away from 'factual' claims about one system of generation (epigenesis) versus another (preformationism) towards a metaphysics of living matter: in this integrated, causally closed universe, which is composed of 'only one substance,' 57  there is no particular demarcation between dead and living matter. And in case we still thought we were dealing with neo-Spinozism understood as a kind of scientifically grounded materialist metaphysics, Diderot happily states here and elsewhere that we are dealing with conjectures, suppositions, thought experiments and all sorts of imaginative, speculative constructs. Crucially - for this sets him apart from proponents of a 'metaphysics of life' like Glisson or, differently, Stahl 58  - Diderot acknowledges that 'the necessary connection in this shift [ sc . from brute matter to thinking matter, or from matter to sensibility and thought, CW] escapes me.' 59  As has frequently been noted, Diderot chooses to put forth some of his most original claims regarding matter, life and sensibility in an experimental work which is neither a philosophical treatise nor an experimental scientific report. 60\n\nIn the second dialogue of the Rêve , the character Bordeu sometimes tells Mlle de Lespinasse, when she is puzzled by some of the speculation (or by biological discussion) to 'do in thought ( par la pensée , literally 'by thought') what Nature does sometimes' (XVII, 149 (twice)). Here is a case in which she is reporting one of the\n\n57 Rêve , in Diderot, Œuvres complètes , XVII, 108.\n\n58 On Glisson, see Giglioni, 'What Ever Happened to Francis Glisson?'; on Stahl as defending a form of vitalism, Kevin (Ku-Ming) Chang, 'From Vitalistic Cosmos to Materialistic World,' in Lawrence M.

'A thread made of pure gold. . . - a homogeneous network. Between its molecules, others interpose themselves and perhaps  form  another  homogeneous  network,  a  tissue  of  sensitive  matter,  a contact  which  absorbs  active  sensibility  from  here  and  latent  sensibility  from there  and  which  communicates  itself  like  motion,  without  including  .  .  .  that there  must  be  some  difference  between  the  contact  of  two  sensitive  molecules and the contact of two molecules which are not, and this difference-what could it be? . . . a habitual action and reaction . . . and this action and this reaction with a unique character . . . Everything concurs thus to produce a sort of unity which only exists in the animal. . ..' 61\n\nIt is not just that Diderot is describing the organizational, transformative potential of 'contact' (which he elsewhere calls 'continuity') between two living molecules, in metaphorical terms ('a thread made of pure gold'). More originally, he is engaging in a form of scientific speculation, as we can see with his appeals to chemical concepts ('action and reaction'), in order to do justice to an apparently holistic phenomenon (the 'sort of unity which only exists in the animal').\n\nDiderot articulates a connection between Spinozism and epigenesis in two very different kinds of texts: an apparently academic, precise entry in the Encyclopédie which combines (or juxtaposes) these different dimensions in a surprising way, and a more speculative, experimental series of reflections in the Rêve de D'Alembert . But as I indicated, there is a third locus for this topic: his debate with Maupertuis a decade earlier, regarding the basic units of living matter or vital minima ('molecules') and what metaphysics is, or should be implicit therein. Some ramifications of Spinozism as an item of or within natural philosophy (fleshing out the persona we encountered above, of the 'modern Spinosist' described in the Encyclopédie ) can be found in this debate, which is both about the units of life and how these should be understood and justified\n\n61  Diderot, Rêve de D'Alembert , in Diderot, Œuvres  complètes , XVII, 119; translation (modified) from http://records.viu.ca/~johnstoi/diderot/dalembertsdream.htm\n\nmetaphysically: a Leibnizian, pan-psychist vision of molecules possessing intentional properties (Maupertuis), versus an emergentist, organizational vision in which these properties are only the properties of the Whole , not of the elements.  Put differently, the Maupertuis-Diderot debate concerning the nature of what they termed 'molecule' is in fact a debate over attribution of properties: should these be applied to the element or the organizational whole? On the surface, this exchange or polemic is also a case of the two authors trading accusations of atheism and Spinozism with each other (for the definition of matter as possessing dynamic, organizational, indeed 'intellective' properties is of course a dangerous one). I shall briefly reconstruct the debate as regards the present topic.\n\nIn 1751, Maupertuis had published (supposedly in Erlangen - actually in Berlin) a Latin treatise entitled Dissertatio inauguralis metaphysica de universali naturae systemate , under the pseudonym Dr Baumann, which he translated into French in 1754 and published with a more specifically 'biological' title: Essai sur la formation des corps organisés . 62  Diderot critically discussed the 'Erlangen dissertation' (and outed its author) in the second edition of his Pensées sur l'interprétation de la nature in 1754 (the first edition had appeared one year earlier), in sections L-LI. Maupertuis replied to Diderot's criticisms in a Réponse aux objections de M. Diderot included in the third and final version of his essay, in his 1756 Œuvres .\n\nIn section XIV of the Essai , Maupertuis asked his readers to imagine a molecule 'endowed with desire, aversion and memory.' 63  Diderot rejected the idea of endowed molecules, at least in its essential form as stated by Maupertuis. In order to challenge Maupertuis' hypothesis, which he accepts at the level of its 'empirical' benefits but not\n\n62  The final version of the text appeared in French with a title closer to the original, Système de la nature , in the 1756 edition of Maupertuis' Œuvres . Marx Wartofsky's 1952 paper is still one of the best commentaries on the topic ('Diderot and the Development of Materialist Monism,' Diderot Studies n° 2 (1952): 279-329, later reprinted in Models. Representation and the Scientific Understanding , Boston Studies in Philosophy of Science, vol. 48 (Dordrecht: Reidel, 1979); specifically, 292-293).\n\n63 Système , § XIV; the term 'endowed' appears in §§ XXXI and LXVI. At the end of the book Maupertuis speaks of 'originarily endowed elements' (§ LIV, 173). The Système and the Réponse are in vol. 2 of the Œuvres ; cited as Système followed by section number (in Roman numerals), and Réponse , followed by page number.\n\nas an overall 'speculative' claim, he seeks to push it as far as it can go, to its 'terrible consequences.' 64  (Maupertuis responded that if one were not already convinced of the sincerity of Diderot's religious beliefs, one might suspect that his intention is not so much to overturn his own theory as to 'himself draw these consequences he calls terrible from it.' 65 ) Diderot felt that Maupertuis's molecules seemed to have been spiritualized, whereas he, Diderot, wanted to materialize the realm of the spiritual (i.e. the mental): first, and epigenetically, there is matter and motion, and gradually, through corpuscular arrangements of increasing complexity - which he terms 'organization' the phenomena or rather faculties of desire, aversion, memory, etc., are added on. Now, this seems rather mechanistic in contrast to Maupertuis; and indeed at this point Diderot introduced the 'dull sensitivity' ( sensibilité sourde ) by means of which all molecules have their place, or fit into place (recall the 'latent sensibility' of the molecules in the Rêve de D'Alembert ). To be precise, Diderot allows for two properties: this rudimentary form of sensitivity, and an 'automatic restlessness' ( inquiétude automate ) which leads the molecules into a variety of possible locations. 66\n\nThe key component in Maupertuis' response to Diderot is a notion which is equally important in Diderot's own thought, that of the Whole ( le Tout ), which has explicit Spinozist overtones. In that sense, when the two authors accuse each other of being Spinozists, it is partly out of bad faith and polemical motivations, but also partly because two monistic visions of matter are at stake - and Diderot is trying to bring out the implicit radicalism of this vision, which Maupertuis wants to keep hidden, wearing the mask of the scientist. It is because both Maupertuis and Diderot are committed to a notion of the universe as a substantial Whole that they are 'neo-Spinozists' in a broad sense, to use Vernière's term- in addition to the specific, idiosyncratic sense manifest,\n\n64  From the outset ( Pensées sur l'interprétation de la nature , § L, in Diderot 1975-, IX, 77) Diderot had declared that he intended to push Maupertuis' hypotheses to their ultimate … or absurd conclusion, in order, he claims somewhat deceptively, to unmask the 'terrible consequences' of the Erlangen Doctor's theory.\n\n65  Maupertuis, Réponse , 197.\n\n66  Diderot, Pensées , § LI, in Diderot, 1975-, IX, 84.\n\ne.g. in the article 'Spinosiste,' that is, a proponent of epigenesis who is also committed to substance metaphysics.\n\nYet as I indicated above, we have to be cautious in endorsing Vernière's concept with respect to both Maupertuis and Diderot, because he insists that what differentiates neo -Spinozists from Spinozists tout court is that the former base their reflections on scientific experiment and induction. This certainly does not apply to the - productive? speculations in the Rêve de D'Alembert . Neither in that text, nor in the Lettre sur les aveugles , nor even in the Éléments de physiologie , does Diderot reason in strictly a posteriori, 'empirical' terms, moving from facts to inductive generalizations. (One need only compare Diderot to Haller, whose physiological works he read very closely: that which distinguishes them is precisely the Spinozist/radical element. 67 ) In addition, the observations, practices and experiments on which the epigenetic theory rests, in Diderot's context, are, as Olivier Bloch observed, no less speculative than those invoked by preformationists or creationists. 68\n\nTo be fair, the figure of the modern Spinozist as an inventor of a new, more empiricist approach to transformations in the sciences can be found elsewhere in this cultural context in the eighteenth century - that is, it did not spring fully formed from Vernière's imagination - , for instance in the Abbé Lelarge de Lignac's 3-volume work against fatalism Le témoignage du sens intime et de l'expérience opposé à la foi profane et ridicule des fatalistes modernes . In this work, which appeared in 1760 (thus five years prior to the above Encyclopédie article), Lignac describes what he terms a 'new Spinozism':\n\nOur  Spinozists  are  quite  subtle  reasoners.  They  abandon  the  materialism  of Locke and revise other points of the doctrine of this Englishman to which they are strongly attached. They mingle adroitly with those of our authors who . . . are drunk  with  the  purported  beauty  of  Locke's  Metaphysics  and  tend  towards universal Spiritualism. Our scattered ( déliés )  Spinozists completely give up on the\n\n67 Namely, if Haller's physiology contributed the idea of a combinatorial system composed of the structural elements of the organism, a system of functional vital properties expressed at various levels of organic integration, Diderot in contrast is either (a) just a commentator on such concepts, (b) a materialist philosopher seeking to accumulate information to support his general metaphysics, or (c), more creatively, a thinker whose reflections on sensibility and fibres, organs, brains, bodies and networks constitute a genuine expansion of vitalist life science, boosted by speculative claims.\n\n68  Bloch, cit. in Bourdin, 'Du Rêve de D'Alembert aux Éléments de physiologie ,' 52-53.\n\nmethod  of  reasoning  by  abstraction  and  consequently  on  Spinoza's  method  they decline to recognise him as their master, and thus are always angry when they are called Spinozists . But they claim to ground Spinoza's system in facts  and deserve the glory of a second invention . 69\n\nAnd there is plenty of reference to Spinoza and Spinozism in the life sciences in the period, usually in pejorative terms (as in philosophy), as in the accusation against Boerhaave that he was a Spinozist. 70  In addition, Vernière's category of neo-Spinozism is not so restrictive as to make its actors - here, Maupertuis and Diderot - strictly a combination of Spinozism and Enlightenment life science; he also allows for the integration of Leibnizian components, which does make much more sense of Diderot's way of understanding the self-organization of living matter, which at times takes the form of a 'materialization of the monad.' 71  But at the level of a framework , Diderot chooses to call it Spinozist, and instead of disqualifying this automatically, we can also consider it either a kind of performative rather than textually strict Spinozism, or a more 'constructivist', home-grown species of the theory; what Ann Thomson once called 'Spinosism with an 's' rather than a 'z', referring to the spelling of Diderot's article. 72  Unlike the more common case, when it is the danger of Spinozism that leads\n\n69 Lelarge de Lignac, Le témoignage du sens intime et de l'expérience opposé à la foi profane et ridicule des fatalistes modernes , 3 vols. (Auxerre: F. Fournier, 1760), vol. 1, 350-351, emphasis mine. Vernière notes ( ibid .) that de Lignac was close to Réaumur, and thus 'up to date' regarding biological research and the sorts of ideological claims relating to such research.\n\n70 The story of how Boerhaave was accused of Spinozism is well known, and can be traced back to his funeral oration (I thank Theo Verbeek for this point). Haller speaks of Boerhaave's 'carelessness' which led him, in an encounter with a cleric who was attacking Spinoza, to 'defend the atheist and hurt the Christian' (letter to Rast of June 5, 1777, in Correspondance inédite de Albert de Haller, Barthez, Tronchin, Tissot avec le Dr. Rast, de Lyon, ed. Dr Vernay (Lyon: Aimé Vingtrinier, 1856), 29). Boerhaave cited Spinoza in his Praelectiones academicae ( ed. Haller, 3 vols., Göttingen: Anton Vandenhoeck, 1739), §§ 570, 578, and La Mettrie associates Boerhaave with Spinoza in his Abrégé des systèmes ( Œuvres philosophiques , ed. F. Markovits [Paris: Fayard, 1987], I, 267). In a strictly medical context, Boissier de Sauvages remarks that mental illness is not always 'a bodily flaw, as Boerhaave implies and the Spinozists assert' ( Nosologie méthodique , 10 vols. [Lyon: Bruyset, 1772], VII,  19).\n\n71 See e.g. the way Diderot moves from the conatus to the Leibnizian nisus, in his consideration of atoms in the article 'Hobbisme' ( Enc . VIII, 235).\n\n72 Ann Thomson, 'Les Lumières radicales sont-elles panthéistes ?,' in Qu'est-ce que les Lumières 'radicales' ?

On the idea of an 'invented Spinozism', see Yves Citton, L'Envers de la liberté. L'invention d'un imaginaire spinoziste dans la France des Lumières (Paris: Éditions Amsterdam, 2006).\n\nthinkers to invent new conceptual tools (from Cudworth or Goclenius to Kant and Fichte 73 ), here it is a positively endorsed form of Spinozism which is invented.\n\n4.\n\nDiderot's Spinozist biology, and epigenesis as the moment of invention of vital materialism, are located in an unusual conceptual space - neither a standard contribution to metaphysical or otherwise systematic discussion of Spinoza, nor a contribution to positive life science destined to become a chapter in a history of science survey. One could then imagine that he chooses to describe 'modern Spinozists' as partisans of epigenesis in order to underscore the radicality of this biological theory, which, as we saw in Le Rêve de D'Alembert , 'can overturn all schools of theology.' Spinozism as epigenesis is not, then, a contribution to positive life science, yet we should not lose sight of the characteristic biologism of the concept, noticeable for instance in its anti-mathematicism. That is, partly like the polyp, monsters and spontaneous generation, epigenesis belongs to  a kind of 'folk biology' which cannot properly be subsumed by the history of biology as a science. And yet, without reverting to the positivistic overtones of Vernière's conception in which Diderot's Spinozism is 'in agreement with scientific data,' we might concede that modern Spinozists of this sort, seek to reconstruct a metaphysics on physiological bases, as Alexandre Métraux has suggested 74 ; but not as inductive generalization.\n\nIf, contrary to earlier readings fixated on the 'myth of the precursor', Diderot belongs neither to the history of biology nor to its prehistory, 75  the question remains :\n\n73 For an interesting claim that German Idealist metaphysics (from Goclenius and Wolff to Fichte and Hegel) emerges specifically as a response to the danger of Spinozism, see Pierre-François Moreau, 'Wolff et Goclenius,' Archives de philosophie vol. 65 n° 1 (2002): 7-14. On the English context, see Rosalie Colie, 'Spinoza and the Early English Deists,' Journal of the History of Ideas , vol. 20, n° 1 (1959): 23-46.\n\n74 Alexandre Métraux, 'Über Denis Diderots Physiologisch Interpretierten Spinoza,' 131.\n\n75 For an early attempt to present 'Diderot's biology' (not Diderot as 'precursor of Darwin', but … as a biologist), see Ferdinand Paitre, Diderot biologiste (1904; reprint, Geneva: Slatkine, 1971): 'Le plus glorieux titre de Diderot à l'admiration de l'historien, c'est . . . d'avoir été le premier transformiste' (89). For an attempt (of the sort made more brilliantly by Canguilhem) to explain why it is wrong to\n\nhow should one account for his complex relation to science, especially life science, which is neither metaphysically grounded (like Descartes' arbor scientiae ) nor a strictly inductive project (like Bacon's tables of experiment)? Not only does his Spinozist biology not fit in the narratives proposed by either the history of biology or (internalist) history of philosophy, furthermore, it also weakens the basis on which some ideologically motivated historians of materialism claim that philosophical materialism the 'handmaiden' of the natural sciences. 76  As Olivier Bloch put it, science is not 'the laboratory of materialism,' 77  or if it is, in a very pluralistic sense.\n\nDiderot's presentation of 'modern Spinozism' as epigenesis plus 'ancient Spinozism,' then, is both\n\n- -a serious engagement with the life sciences in flux in the mid-eighteenth century (and an anti-mathematical one)\n- -a metaphysical project, in which natural history and physiology are in the service of materialism (but a vital materialism, of active, self-transforming matter)\n- -a speculative project (with a 'radical' dimension) which as such does not belong to the history of science and cannot be subsumed within it.\n\n## References\n\npresent Diderot as an evolutionist or transformist (or a precursor thereof), see Lester G.
