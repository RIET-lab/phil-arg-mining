Both professors and institutions of higher  education  benefit  from  a  vision  of academic  life  that  is grounded more firmly in myth than in history.  According to the myth created  by  that  traditional  vision,  scholars  pursue  research  wherever their  drive  to  knowledge  takes  them,  and  colleges  and  universities transmit the fruits of  that research to contemporary and future generations as the accumulated wisdom of  the ages.\n\nFaculty  members  use  the  myth  to  justify  the  pursuit  o f research interests  that  may  not  result  in  new  products  or  a  clear  competitive edge for their university.  Institutions o f   higher education use the myth to  justify  a  tax-exempt  status  and  to  solicit  funds.  The  institutions argue,  correctly,  that  they  are  the  only  institutions  in  modern  lifepublic  or  private-that have  as  their  primary  business  such  a  heavy component of  public service. They are involved not only with creating a growing base of  knowledge for society, but also with providing public access to that base-all without seeking a profit.\n\nYet  the  economic  and  social forces  operating  on colleges  and  universities as institutions, as well as on the interests  o f   faculty members within them, are making the myth embodied in the traditional ideal of the academy more and more difficult to sustain.

These are not  theoretical  questions,  but  practical  questions  o f immediate import that must be answered relatively quickly-and wiselyif  institutions o f   higher education and professors are not to find themselves inextricably in the grip o f   forces they cannot change. The myth of  disinterested  academic  research-however beautiful.  and  however beneficial-is under siege.'\n\nI.\n\nInstitutions of  higher education face the same economic problems as every other institution in society. But  more importantly, while it may once have been true that pure academic research  drove technological development, technology no  longer waits for serendipitous theoretical discovery.2  Technology  is  banging  at  the  door  for  what  it  needsanswers to questions raised by prior technological development and the theoretical means to assure faster development in the fu t u r e .\n\nSuch demands may seem to issue primarily from profit-seeking corporations,  concerned  about  maintaining  their  competitive  edge,  but they  are  in  fact  coming  from  all  sections  o f a  rapidly  progressing society. The demands are such that little difference  is perceivable among them. Corporations seek to increase their competitive edge. Regulatory agencies desire to correct or avoid the excesses of  earlier developments and to keep abreast o f   new  ones.  National  or local  governments want to stay strategically ahead of  whatever competitors they may perceive. In short, technological advance  is  in  the  driver's  seat.  If  universities cannot satisfjr these demands, they will no longer be able to claim that they are even in the  intellectual vanguard,  let  alone that  they are in the lead.\n\nIn such an environment, universities have sought to keep their heads above water through partnerships with industry and government. Sometimes  these  partnerships  consist  of  consortium  arrangements among several  participating  institutions,  and  sometimes an  arrangement between  a  particular university  and  a  particular  corporation  or  governmental agency. Whatever the arrangement, one thing is clear: the stateof-the-art  scientific  and  technological  research  that  universities have always specialized in is, in the contemporary world, far too expensive for any university to conduct alone.\n\nMo r e importantly, the problems that make it necessary to push theory and application to new levels are often more clearly perceived by users than by  pure theoreticians. Cooperation between researchers and users is necessary if  researchers are to  have a clear idea o f   what theoretical\n\n1. See Derek  C.

Such   relationships seem necessary even from the perspective of the academy.\n\nThe costs of the continual replacement and refinement of this equipment are enormous. One can measure both how the need is and how little institutions of higher education have to on equipment by how upset the academic scientific community is over recent budget cuts in the small-instrumentation program at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The NIH has cut this budget sixty-nine per cent from 1991 The result, it is claimed , is that the infrastructure of science will deteriorate because no other sources of funding are available:' Although the original budget is small in comparison with the total amount spent on research and development, it represents a sum when compared with the normal budgets of the universities needing such instrumentation. great spend large\n\nEquipment is one of the most expensive aspects of science. Developments in science are always marked by developments in equipment; each new theoretical  advance carries with it the possibility for, and necessity of, new instrumentation. Currently, one cannot teach biology without the capacity to separate DNA molecules. In physics, OUI capacity to examine subatomic particles has produced both the need for and the capacity to produce enormously expensive clocks that measure incredibly small increments of time A physicist trying to work on the cutting of science, Or trying to teach the physicists of the future, cannot be without access to this equipment. edges\n\nThe same is true of the total spent on research and development. In 1989, American industry spent $71.77 billion on research and development, and the state and federal governments spent $68.72 billion. Only a small portion of these amounts to institutions of higher education; For instance, the Federal government proposed a 1992 budget of $11.5 billion for research at universities .= Although this is a small percentage of the total 1989 budget of $140.49 billion, it represents a amount when compared with normal university  budgets. Most universities   would look at the $231 million Stanford is accused of overcharging the Federal government from 1981 through 1988 and wish for a small portion of that to add to their normal budgets. The impact goes large\n\n3. Stephen Burd, Loss of Federal Grants for Expensive Equipment Upsets Scientists at Major Research Universities, CHRON. HICHER EDuc. Feb. 26, 1992, at A23.\n4. William ).

HIGHER EDuc. , Feb. 5, 1992, at A25. Say\n\non smaller institutions of  even a  little extra money can be  enormous. For  example,  the $3 million  extra  per  year  LeHigh  University  has obtained  from 1984 through 1991 through  its  Ben  Franklin  Center constitutes a good percentage of  the budgets of  many universities.'\n\nUniversities increasingly need more funding as the total is decreasing. Though funding for research and  development increased dramatically during the 1970s to  a high of $154.31 million in 1989, the total fell to $151.57 million in 1990 and is projected to continue to fall.8  Additionally,  the  irregularities  associated  with  university  funding  will  likely lead to a tightening o f   the federal rules on indirect cost. The vagueness of  these rules is claimed to have 'invited opportunistic  interpretation^\"^ and possibly the $350 million in overcharges claimed at 22 universities. Thus, the total funds available may continue to fall.\n\nThe concern about competition from abroad, however, especially  with recent reports that the Japanese rn already spending more on research and development than the United  States, may  well reverse the downward  trend  of funding.1° Still, individual states are cutting back  their spending  significantly  because  of  severe  economic  problems.*l The result  of  these  factors  is  that  many  institutions  of  higher  education, faced  with  their  own  financial  difficulties, are either  entering  the competitive market  for research funds for the  first time or  expanding their existing programs with renewed vigor.\n\nAs more institutions of  higher education chase fewer  dollars, some institutions are bound to have problems. Sorely needed dollars may be diverted to create a research institute in an attempt to  pull  in money to  help  the  general state of  the  institution.  Problems result as these universities often end up with little, or nothing, to show for the invested funds. Yet the demand for such funding still exists within institutions of  higher education: such institutions cannot continue at the forefront\n\n7.

The difference for the total amount spent in 1989 from  the  previous  quoted  figun, of $140.49 million  comes,  apparently,  from  Broad's calculating the total in constant 1991 dollars to discount the effects of  inflation.\n9.

Disputes about how much Japan is spending vis-a-vis the United States turn  on how to calculate exchange rates. B y   the standard rate, the one any tourist pays, Japan is spending almost as much as the United  States. By a rate the federal government uses, in which a dollar is worth 204 yen instead o f   the  (relatively) current 134 market value, Japan is spending nowhere near as much. Clearly, simple comparisons can mislead. As a  percentage of  their  gross national  product,  Japan has been spending  more  than  the United States on research and development for years.\n\nThe concentration upon Japan can mislead as well. What  is ignored is that  Germany is also spending  significantly more than  the United  States as a  percentage of  its  gross national  product and has been doing so for  a  long  time.

The sense that industry and the federal and state governments are going to have to   provide such   funding continues to BrOW \\_ As a result, academia looks far different today than it looked even as little as forty 12 ago. years\n\nThe Massachusetts   Institute of Technology (MIT)   reflects a small hundred new patents a year, with a 1991 success rate in licensing of fifty-three   percent. The  average at most university  and government laboratories is less than one percent. MIT's researchers do not just do research and publish the results for all to see , but produce carefully guarded ideas which the institution then patents and markets. Given the traditional perspective of universities and faculty, MIT looks more like a corporation   engaged in the   relatively   profitable business of producing ideas that it licenses to the highest bidders. 1\n\nII.\n\nThis brave new world of academia has grown up relatively quickly and quietly. While there are strong historical antecedents for the present cooperation between universities and government and between universities and corporations, the recent growth of contemporary partnerships between universities and external sponsors has been phenomenal. There is every reason to expect the pace to accelerate in the future. \"\n\nAs with any fast-paced change, there are growing pains. Stanford University' s difficulties in charging what the government has deemed to be millions of   dollars in unwarranted overhead have made the national news The Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) has hit the pages of national newspapers  and international magazines because of its   relations with the Central   Intelligence Agency   (CIA). To be as charitable as possible, the problems these two institutions face come\n\n12. A recent film sponsored by the National Science Foundation entitled A Partnership for Competitiveness gives one a sense not only of how things have changed, but of the general   sort   of justification given for the change. The film examines five engineering research centers throughout the country funded and otherwise supported by industry The theme of the film is clear its opening remarks: Americans have always been competitive, shown against background of an American runner winning a race and another American playing in piano competition.  The voice-over goes on to say that America must \"'compete as a nation for world markets and standard of living' and that 'for this global competition there is a new American team The players are the nation's industries, universities, and OUr government.

Sullivanle  cuts to the core of  one crucial set of issues. A contract between the NIH and Stanford University 'require(d1 researchers to obtain government approval before publishing or otherwise  discussing  preliminary  research  results.'17 NIH's argument was that if  public funds are to be spent on research, there must be  public accountability  which,  NIH  claimed,  implied  that  funded  researchers were not even to talk about their preliminary findings without governmental  approval.  Judge  Greene  held  that  the NIH's prepublication review  of  any  speech or  publication  produced  as a  result  of  an  NIH grant violated the First Amendment right to free speech.\n\nThe potentially chilling effects o f NIH's position on universities and university  research  are obvious.  Research  proceeds  by  discussion, by the  sharing and  probing of one's judgments and results-preliminary and otherwise. I f   the university is to be  an  open  forum committed to the pursuit o f   knowledge, it cannot allow such prior restrictions on the normal  and  necessary  discourse among participants  in  the  research process.\n\nYet one can easily imagine situations in which such restrictions seem appropriate-whether imposed by governmental agencies or by  corporations. In addition, the facts of  modern life in any highly competitive area  of  research  indicate  that-far from  the  hearty  liberal  discussion and sharing envisioned in the academic myth-university communities are  by  now  very  much  at  home  with  the near frantic  secrecy  often deemed  necessary  by  scholars  to  preserve  and  protect  their  various personal proprietary interests in their own research.18\n\nWhy  would a corporation  fund  research  in  an  area  of  commercial concern and yet allow the results to be  discussed openly, thus risking that  its  competitors  could  gain  the commercial advantage of  the  discoveries, without the expense? Prohibiting altogether the kind  of  res-\n\n15.  Stanford claims that  its problems come  primarily  fmm  the  federal  government having ignored  memoranda of  understanding between the two governing how  indirect costs are to be calculated. See Blumenstyk, S U ~ M note 6, at A25. A34. The point we are making is that, whatever the details o f the  dispute, better policies may  very well have prevented the problems f r o m arising in the first place.\n16.

See Tom  Beauchamp, Ethical  Issues in  Funding  and Monitoring University Research, 11  BUS. &amp; PROF. ETHICS J., 9-11  (1992) (on  ethical  issues  raised  by  potential conflicts of  interest in  such settings].\n\ntrictions deemed necessary by sponsors would certainly inhibit funding, whether by  governmental  agencies, like the CIA,  which  may  require secrecy  in the interest of  what  is perceived to be national security, or by  corporations concerned to protect vital commercial interests. Patent law provides some protection against domestic competition, but in an international environment, where corporations often operate, such protection may  seem rather slim.\n\nHarvard  University's  policy,  for  all  intents  and  purposes,  simply prohibits research done on its time or using its facilities that cannot be published.  The  rationale  is  that  an  institution  o f higher  education cannot  sustain  its  position as an open  forum  for  the  discovery and dissemination of  knowledge unless  all  research  is  pub1i~hable.l~ The price  o f such a  policy  is  the  loss  of  some  research  monies,  a  price Harvard  presumably can afford to pay.  Yet  other institutions, without an  endowment  as  large  as  Harvard's and  perhaps  lacking Harvard's intellectual prestige, do not have that luxury.\n\nBesides,  prohibiting research cuts against another core value of  any academic institution-the autonomy of  its professionals, professors, to determine what  research  they  ought  to  pursue.  Indeed,  prohibiting professors from pursuing particular avenues of  research on the basis of some  ideal  about  the  value  of  a  university being  an  open  forum  is arguably itself  a  form  of  prior restraint. It  is  a  restraint that  not  only denies the academic freedom of  professors, but also impedes universities and colleges from nurturing new knowledge.\n\nInstitutions o f   higher education, it seems, cannot have it both ways. They cannot claim to allow professors to  pursue knowledge, wherever such a pursuit may lead, and at the same time prohibit professors from accepting grants that mandate certain restrictions on their  free speech or  their  rights  o f   publication.20  Further,  in  prohibiting  restrictive research contracts, universities r i s k harming  their  long-term  interest in obtaining outside funding  for  research  that  would  otherwise be  too expensive, thus endangering their putative position at the forefront of knowledge.\n\nIt  would  seem  that  a  university's goals  of  being 1) an open  forum and 2) at  the  forefront  o f knowledge cannot  both  be  met  without compromise, given the necessity for outside funding to pursue research. The  compromises  that  various  institutions  o f   higher  education  have made  between  these  goals are collapsing under the  pressure of  technological  development's  insistent  demands  for  particular  varieties  of pure research  and under the weight of  the massive funding required to do  that research. Given the current climate, it  is imperative that universities recognize the need for change. In order to be meaningful, this\n\n19.  On this issue, see John Shattuck. Secrecy on Campus, 19 J.C. 8  U.L. 217 (1993). 20.  For  further  discussion  of  this  issue,  see  Nicholas  Steneck,  Whose  Academic Freedom Needs to be Protected? The Case of Classified Research. 11 BUS. &amp; PROF. ETHICS J. 17. 24-30 (1992).\n\nchange must begin with the examination of   what have been until now their sustaining myths.\n\nThere will  be  a clear loss if  the university  preserves  its traditional open forum at the cost of  sacrificing its intellectual leadership. There will be an equally clear loss if  intellectual leadership is secured at the cost  of  the  open  availability of  new  discoveries  for  public  scrutiny, discussion, and education.\n\nFaculty, it seems, cannot'have it both  ways either. They cannot be free to pursue whatever contracts they want, whatever the restrictions, and at the same time retain unlimited access to the research results of others who  may  also contract to  do  research  under  restrictions. The myth of  academicians working at the cutting edges.of knowledge, free to hire themselves out to  get the funding to push against those edges, is  itself an unstable  compromise.  Professors cannot  fully retain both 1) the  conditions of  open  inquiry  required  to  ensure  viable  research (and properly  generated research  questions) and 2) the academic freedom to do  whatever  they  wish,  including  accepting grants  with trictions on  publication  and  dissemination of  results.z1  In  additioi professors accept g $ing them from adding to the public s of  knowledge and IS of  higher education adopt policies permit  them  to  d ier  professors  nor  institutions  can 1 themselves out as ulwU1llGU wearers of  the academic traditions of o inquiry, open debate, open criticism, and open contribution. res80,\n\nIn  short,  the  issues  raised  by  funded  research are major  issues of public policy that involve difficult choices between competing valueswhether to prefer academic freedom, even if  it includes the liberty to make contracts with restrictions on speech or publication, or to  prefer the ideal o f   openness which would seemingly preclude such contracts.\n\n## m.\n\nThe  choices  that  need  to  be  made  have  implications  €or broader issues.  For  instance, professors are hired as employees of  universities and remain employees subject to the restrictions their employers impose on  their  work.  Professors, however, are also  professionals  who  were hired  because o f   their  disciplinary expertise. They are historians, musicians,  philosophers,  and  chemists  first,  obligated  to  pursue their professional inclinations as part of  the conditions of  their employment. They, not the institutions that employ them, are the experts in matters concerning the appropriate course that research-and education-should take.22\n\n21. For the  perspective  of  the  AAUP  on this  issue, see B.  Robert  Kreiser.  AAUP Perspectives on Academic Freedom  and  United  States Intelligence Agencies,  19 J.C. &amp; U.L. 251 (1993).\n\nAnother helpful article in this  regard is Rebecca S. Eisenberg. Academic Freedom and Academic Values in Sponsored Research. 66 Tm. L.  REV. 1363 (1988).\n\n22.\n\nSee also Steneck, supm note\n\n20.\n\nThe conflicts that  arise  regarding  funded research are symptomatic of the  more  general  issue  that  arises  for any professional  working within and for any institution. How can one maintain one's professional integrity while  acting as an employee o f   an organization which may, for  good  or  bad  public policy  reasons,  prohibit or  constrain activities that one thinks essential?\n\nIt would be overdramatic to call this an issue of  conscience. Professors are not  the  only  professionals faced  with  hard  choices  because  they find themselves  within  organizations that  can  and  do constrain their professional choices. Physicians who work at hospitals may find themselves unable to do what their conscience requires-like provide abortions or provide free surgery for those without the resources to  paybecause o f   restrictions imposed by  the institution  in which they must work.  Lawyers may  find themselves unable to  do what they  feel obligated to do as professionals-like provide substantial pro bono workbecause the f i r m that  employs them requires too much work on remunerative projects to leave time for other work.\n\nAny solution to the problem of  how professors ought to exercise their professional autonomy within the setting of  institutions of  higher education  will  affect  how  we  ought  to  think  about  the  autonomy  of professionals in  other  settings. The reasons  one  gives  for  a  solution, and the sort of  choices one makes between the competing values, will find a home in other competitive situations in which similar values are at issue and will have implications for medical practice, legal practice, and  professional practice  in  general.  Such reasons  and  choices  have precedential value.  If  the reasons are powerful enough and  provide a broad  enough  conception o f the  role  o f professionals,  they  ought  to provide a basis for a more general understanding.\n\nThe  broader  implications regarding  the  proper  role  of  public  institutions are also a  concern. Universities have  a  monopoly  on the dissemination of  knowledge and skills to future generations and serve as gatekeepers  for  the  professions.  One  cannot  practice  medicine,  for example, without a medical degree f r o m an  institution of  higher education.\n\nUniversities are  given  such  a  monopoly  because  of the  perceived benefits to  the public.  The monopoly also yields manifest benefits  to the  institutions.  Yet  one  could  argue  that  institutions are granted monopolies only on the presumption that they also have certain obligations. Thus, when a publicly supported institution engages in profitmaking research that prevents it f r o m doing what it is given a monopoly to  do,  one must ask whether it deserves the monopoly and what  sort of   institutional arrangement would best serve the originally envisioned purpose.  These  questions are complicated  by  the  need  for  external funding to pay for otherwise unaffordable research.\n\nThe  answers  will  have  implications  for  other  public  institutions, particularly those that are granted monopolies for various public services. We  grant monopolies to hospitals to provide for the public health.\n\nL e sum-total  of  I future generations s that benefit such We support these monopolies through a health care system that provides payments to hospitals and requires surgeons to work through hospitals . Careful  periodic consideration must be given to our   deliberate sustenance of all such monopolies. If we find that hospitals are run primarily as profit-making   organizations, we may want to ask what sort of care. It is no more obvious that a hospital system devoted to earning profits for its stockholders and its   employees, including health care practitioners, provides  the most appropriate   institutional   vehicle for caring for public health than that institutions of higher education with a for   increasing and   passing that knowledge public support.\n\nPublic  institutions , such as universities and hospitals, are   labeled public because they exist to serve a public interest in knowledge and health care Yet these institutions are human artifacts that can be changed if fail to serve well the public ends to serve When such institutions rest on a collection of beliefs about their purpose that is itself in internal   conflict, as is the case with institutions of higher education, change will no matter what. 23 With the unithey they ought\n\nIt is not unusual for an institution to exist for a time despite internal tensions and thep for those tensions under external pressures or from the buildup of heat from the friction, to cause the whole to alter fundamentally . Gordon S. Wood argues that the American revolution was indeed revolutionary because it fundamentally altered the social relations between people, and it is the crucial premise in his argument that 'Colonial society was in tension torn between   contradictory monarchical and   republican tendencies . GORDON $ Wood, THE RADICALISM OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION 124 (1992). It may be argued that the resolution of that tension was not completed by the Revolution long\n\nIt could be argued as well that ope problem with the Meech Accord rejected by the Canadian provinces is that it covered the tension of separate and somewbat independent province under that vague Constitutional phrase, \"a distinct society. That phrase, it could be argued , might hold the nation together for some time, but ultimately would not resolve the tensions inherent in having one province holding such position in nation of supposedly equal provinces. baving unique and that the United States  existed under conception filled with tension between its stated ideals of equality for all citizens and its acceptance of slavery until the Dred Scott case attempted to resolve the tension by, amopg other things, denying that slaves could ever be citizens The   result was Civil War that   produced fundamentally altered relation between citizens and the Federal Government.\n\nThe general thesis is that social institutions rest on conceptions of their point that may be internally incoherent, or in internal tension in some other way, that accommodations to the competing demands are always made within social  institution, and that those tensions will work themselves out thoroughly when the right conditions prevail to make intolerable their co-existence, even with those accommodations. Our claim is that the traditional of the university is and that the rigbt conditions may now prevail for the dissolution of some of internal conflicts. myth its\n\nWe neither applaud nor condemn this change, only mark it.\n\nversities' increased need for external funding and with the concern that restrictions contrary to the supposed ends o f   furthering public knowledge will  be  imposed as  conditions for  such funding,  the  traditional view of  academia has reached a point in which the tensions among the components of  its self-conception have become evident. These tensions will be  resolved  in one way  or another over time; the only question is whether we shall intelligently resolve them, with clear ends in mind, or  whether they will resolve themselves, willy-nilly through the individual decisions of  the various participants.\n\nThus, the problem we face goes beyond the fact that various elements within our conception  of  the  university are in tension  and  that  we must make hard choices between competing values if we are to exercise a measured control over the inevitable change. The sorts of  choices we make and the kind of  reasons we  give will have a gravitational effect on other public  institutions facing similar tensions.  The question we must ask is how to proceed.\n\nnr.\n\nThe ideal  resolution would  be  cleverly  to  restructure the  essential components of our conception of  academia, with a slight twist here, a judicious cut there, reconfiguring in such a way that the most important values  no  longer compete, but, as in  the  best  o f   cases,  further  each other.  But  the  values  in competition are so at  odds with  one another that  'finessing' their conflict does not seem possible. One cannot, for example, make the autonomy of  professors regarding funded research absolute and at the same time guarantee that universities will continue to be  primarily committed to the increase of  public knowledge. Some so r t of  compromise must be made.24\n\nY e t no noncontentious theory will allow one to choose between the competing values. One may argue for the efficiency of letting individual professors  decide  for  themselves  what  research  to  accept.  One  may buttress  that  argument  with  a  claim  that  without  evidence  to  the contrary,  professors  ought  not  to  be  presumed  to  harm  university value~.~5 Such an argument presupposes a more general argument about what sort s of  presumptions ought to be made when individual freedom of choice  is  at  issue.  The  implication,  which  needs  argument on independent grounds, is that the professor's freedom of  choice counts for more than the public's interest in a certain kind of  university.\n\nSimilarly, one might argue that the public's interest is more important than the freedom of  choice o f   individual professors. Presumably, insti- point we are ur g i n g  i s that  mch accommodations, made  singly without much  thought to their long-term  consequences  regarding  the structure of institutions  o f   higher education, are  no longer sufficient. 24.  We are n o t denying that accommodations have already been made. For instance, professors keep the  royalties for books and  articles produced on university time.  The\n\ntutions  such as Harvard are willing to  provide such an argument. I n either case, one is presuming a way of  weighing the competing values. No noncontentious theory provides a decisive and determinate method of  weighing such things. In this respect,  the problem with which we wrestle resembles many other public-policy issues.\n\nOne might address the problem from another direction by examining what universities have actually done to resolve the conflict. According to  Nicholas Steneck, the responses of  universities to this problem fall into  one  of  three  categories:  avoidance,  separation,  and  regulation.28 Avoidance and separation are inadequate, for the reasons sketched by Steneck. By definition, policies of  avoidance refuse to acknowledge the importance of  these problems and are effective only as long as the issue of  funded research rarely arises. Small colleges might avoid the problem entirely, but any institution which takes advantage of  outside funding by charging overhead cannot do this. A s soon as an institution decides that it will profit, it has committed itself to a policy regarding funded research, even though it may  be  doing so without considering what is an appropriate policy.\n\nSeparating funded research  by creating an institute or  'independent corporation' for such research seems the preferred procedure for many large universities.  Such policies of  separation are inadequate because they place the simultaneously vital and problematic research activities in question effectively beyond the control of  the university. No institution should voluntarily relinquish control over matters so vital to its very  existence. Besides,  it  is myth that  such  institutions have  in fact relinquished control. Since a university could readily change the relationship,  real  separation is a legal f i c t i o n . Separating research  fmm traditional university activities is really just a form of  regulation.\n\nThe only type of  policy worth considering, then,  is regulation. The question is what shape regulation of  external research contracts should take. It is a mistake to devote much attention, in the present crisis, to what  specific policy a  university  should adopt regarding its  external contracts. Should all research that may  not be published  be banned?z7 Should individual faculty researchers be given the benefit of  the doubt that  secrecy in  particular contracts is  not  harmful?*8  These questions appear the most pressing, but tr y i n g to adopt a policy regarding these matters runs into the problem of  balancing competing values when no acceptable criterion exists for that  balancing.  In  addition,  adoption of a policy requires a determination about who should decide the content of  that policy.\n\nAnother concern is that the adoption of  a policy, whatever it is, will cut through a complex system of  competing values. I n any even moderately complex social structure, the ways  in which various constitu-\n\n26.\n\nId.\n\n27. see Shettuck. secrecy on Campus, 19 J.C. b U.L. 217 (1 9 9 3 ) .\n\n28.

Change one factor and the other parts of the system must realign themselves . The   system is complex, and the modes of adjustment many , that it is not   possible to know how a simple prohibiting research unless the material is published within a reasonable period of time, it may find itself losing out in the competition for research scientists who might: go to institutions that   provide more choice. The university cannot know beforehand what values the scientists will deem most important.\n\nBesides, a policy on these matters cannot to be both good and effective if it is not made in the right When no substantive and accepted moral theory provides a clear way to make value choices, one must appeal to some procedure that is as pure as it can be, and one must allow the procedure to work to produce the choices. hope way .\n\nS0 it is a mistake to suppose that any policy will settle matters\\_ policy will provide a fulcrum upon which other parts of a university may turn and s0 will provide a basis for change. What is wanted is a policy that best furthers the values in competition, but the content of such a policy is not a priori clear. Any\n\nThus, universities need constitutions   establishing where decisions concerning research contracts of various kinds are to be made what objections may trump potential contracts, and how such contracts are to be reviewed. Only in this way may the   legitimate   interests and demands of scholarship, openness, academic freedom, intellectual leadership, and institutional health be balanced wisely.\n\nOften, when a decision cannot be made, a committee appointed and makes a recommendation only after the urgency has passed so that the powers that be can safely ignore it. Still, appealing to a committee has its purposes. Given a long-term problem of accommodating competing values, a standing committee, properly constituted and following the appropriate procedure, can be a device for coming to grips with an issue with no ready solution. Committees may administrators \"off the hook' and may appear only politically expedient when the solutions offer could be achieved by other especially when some independent basis exists for the decision arrived at by the committee: Yet sometimes a committee can settle the matters at issue for all concerned. gets get they\n\nIt is helpful to contrast a committee as a procedural device with other forms of procedural  justice in which the aim is not to settle conflicts between values, but to achieve a just solution. There is pure procedural justice, and there is perfect   and imperfect  procedural  justice.2 The\n\nlatter occur when we know ahead of time what would be just because we have grounds independent of  the procedures for determining this. I f   we can devise a procedure to produce what we already know to be just,  we  have  perfect  procedural justice,  and  if  we  cannot,  we  have imperfect procedural justice. The criminal justice system is an example of   the latter. To find guilty all and only those who actually committed a crime would be just, but we can design only an imperfect procedure to produce a result more or less approximating what would be just.\n\nWe  have  pure  procedural  justice  when  we  cannot know  ahead  of time what would be just and what is just is determined by the procedure itself. A lottery is a good example. If  the procedure for picking a winner is pure, i.e.,  there is no cheating and no coercion, the outcome is just. The winner is determined by  the  procedure.  It would  be  false to  say that the winner deserves to win in any other sense than that the outcome was  determined  by  the  procedure.  To  say  the  winner  deserved  the outcome would  imply  that  one  had  some  independent  criterion  for determining who ought to win and who ought to lose.\n\nThere is no comparable dissection o f   procedural devices for alternative ways to come to grips with competing values, but a helpful analogy can be  drawn with  this taxonomy  of  procedural justice. A committee can approach pure procedural justice. Properly constituted and following  the  proper  procedures,  it  produces  acceptable  solutions  to  the problems it faces. Such a committee must be properly pure; that is, its decisions must not be coerced by any body external to it or constrained by  external considerations having  nothing to do with the cases before it,  and  it  itself  must  properly represent the various interests involved and  not  be  skewed  to  favor  one  form  of  resolution  over  another.  I f these conditions are satisfied, then no legitimate foothold will support criticism of  its deliberations or decisions.\n\nThe procedure is designed to accommodate, on a case-by-case basis, competing values.  The  difficulty of  such an accommodation, and  the main source of  disanalogy, are the independent grounds for decisions that  accommodate  the  competing values.  For  a  standing  committee, each case presents a test case for each value in competition. No matter how pure the procedure, however,  an objective observer can find  an independent basis  for  rejecting any proffered  solution. This  is  a  consequence of  having  competing values backed  with  competing visions and competing grounds of  support.\n\nThe  standing  committee  is  a  procedural  device  to  'finesse'  the problem primarily created by not having some overarching non-contentious theory that allows one to choose between the competing values. The purer the procedure, the better the arguments that justify particular decisions, the more respectable the members o f   the committee, the more deeply committed to that procedural solution, the less likely it is that those affected by the decision will reject the results o f   the procedure.30\n\nPut  another  way,  the  purer  the  procedure,  the  less  legitimacy  any independent objections will have because they will already have been given  a  fair  hearing  within  the  committee's deliberations and  determined not to be decisive.\n\nIt  would  stretch matters to  say that  the  procedure itself  determines the  acceptable resolution.  Such a  claim is  unnecessary  for what is at the standing committee can only approach pure procedural justice. To say the procedure itself determines what is acceptable would imply that no can properly trump its competitors on any independent grounds . Although those committed to a value may concede that as a practical matter cannot wrest consent from those holding the competing value, need not concede that   theoretically no way that their   value   ultimately deserves to triumph. Agreeing to a procedural   device like a standing committee is an act of trust by those deeply committed to their position that their vision will be treated fairly and with respect. It need be construed only as a pragmatic   step taken because one cannot agreement, not as a theoretical commitment required because no independent grounds give us the right answer. why they they get\n\nIt is the clearest  example we have of a (relatively) pure procedure  whose the  committee  must  be  constituted so as  to  allow  the  procedure  to function and  its  results to  have  appropriate respect.31 These are not separable issues. A procedure's results will be acceptable only provided that the committee that  deliberates is constituted in a certain way and operates  within  a  certain so r t of  governing  framework.  Change  the committee, or change the framework, and the procedure itself  is damNot just any procedure will and not just any committee, however pure, will do. The   procedure must   force evaluation of the various reasons Put another the existence of such a procedure presupposes the existence of certain forms of   relationship between the various constituencies of a university . To create such a procedure is to commit oneself to such a relationship . do, aged. way ,\n\nThe authors point out the tension that exists between the acceptance of procedure, with all that that implies the acceptance of the results of following the procedure, even when one thinks the results mistaken, and the rejection of some of the results of an accepted procedure, with all that that implies for the rejection of the procedure that gave rise to the result. To commit oneself to a procedural resolution of a problem is to commit   oneself to the results of thatprocedure, whatever may beprovided, of course, that the procedure is the appropriate one. for they\n\n- 31 Review panels for research on human subjects are clear example of standing committees that have worked successfully to accommodate sometimes very contentious competing values. Our concern with those panels as model is that we think can exist within almost any institutional setting,   without concern about changing the institutional structure significantly. The proposal we make will require changes, in some cases significant   changes , in institutional structure and  governance if  the   standing committee is to be as successful, and noncontentious, as the review panels. using they\n\npoint  is to articulate alternative positions and the reasons for adopting those positions. The legal process is an example of  how to  come to a decision by considering the weight of  various arguments, for or against some  claim that  has  value  and  is  competing  with  some  other  claim supposed to have more value. The legal process, in short, is a paradigmatic procedural device for resolving competing values in a way  that is supposed to be acceptable. Certain procedural features are of  particular relevance to any committee that would consider what ought to be done  regarding  research  grants.  We  can  discover  some  of  these  by considering  what  a  judge  ought  to  do  in  deciding  a  case  in  which important values conflict.\n\nA judge's first obligation is to comprehend the points of  view o f both pa r t i e s . People do not normally go to the Supreme Court, for instance, unless convinced they  have  a  good  case-a fundamental right  that  is being  denied,  or  a  great  harm  that  is  being  inflicted on them.  The judge must come to understand the principles and arguments that move one party to expend such great effort, and spend so much money, to support  its  claim.  The  judge  must  then  back o f f and  do  exactly the same thing for the other party.\n\nThis complex process of  getting inside the case from each opposing point of  view has two aims. One is to comprehend the nature of  each party's  vision  of  the  law-what each  party  believes  the  law  is  and ought to be, the view that animates the conviction that wrong will be done if  a party's claim is denied. The other is to understand the legal and moral principles which motivate each  claim-how powerful they are and so how wide their scope, how much more will be  affected by them than what is at issue in the particular case, and how buttressed they are by other principles within  the system, and  which principles in  the  system will  be  strengthened and  which  weakened  whichever position is sustained.\n\nThese two  aims are complemented by  another feature of  the procedure. It  is  designed to tease out not just the competing visions o f   law and the opposing principles, but all the relevant reasons for each view.32 This i s accomplished in three  primary  ways.  Opposing  lawyers must can  in  order to  lay  the  groundwork for  appeal  should they  lose, and must respond to questions from judges. When one considers a succession  of cases  about  a  single  issue  or  set  of issues,  all  the  relevant reasons  have  even  more  chance  to  be  heard.  The  opposing  lawyers meet the arguments each gives, must give as many arguments as they build on the arguments given in previous cases, honing and sharpening\n\n32.  One difficulty with analogies, of course. is that there are  o f t e n   as  many points of difference as similarity.  One  might thus  object that  in the  law  evidence is barred  and that surely we do n o t wish to have anything similar i n what we mmmend.  The response is  that barring evidence i s itself  a  matter of  contention, for  considered  argument from both sides, and that rather than restrict any committee from barring evidence, we would suggest that  the same standards be m e t for it as for the  law.\n\nthem,  and  add  new  arguments,  now  made  more  germane or pointed by changes in the factual situations or by the reasoning given by judges in previous decisions.33\n\nOne wants all the relevant reasons to be  heard because even though one  reason  may  be  decisive,  making  sure one has  all  the  reasons guarantees that  one will fully comprehend the ramifications of  a decision. A particular position may  be  based on high principle, but have practical implications decidedly contrary to the public good.=  Making sure one has all the reasons for adopting a position will help one make the proper decision and allow for its full precedential effects. In short, by  alternately  taking  up  the  opposing points  of  view  in a  procedure designed to elicit reasons for a  decision, a  judge  can understand the arguments that me given for the opposing positions and, perhaps more importantly, the opposing visions of  the nature of  the law-how each position will ultimately affect our understanding  o f   the  nature o f   law and of  the principles which underlie it.\n\nThe judge must weigh the competing visions, examine the opposing arguments, and  decide. When more than one judge is hearing a case, the  process  is  both  complicated,  by  having  to  come  to  grips  with opposing understandings of   what ought to be  decided, and eased, by forcing one to  come to  grips with those opposed understandings and articulate one'$ own view more clearly in light of  those alternatives. I n the best  o f   situations, the process furthers the fairness of  the decision by  preventing any  one judge  from furthering particular objectives or deciding on the basis of  particular biases.  Additionally, the evaluative process itself  is furthered by  requiring the judge writing the majority opinion to subject his or her views to the scrutiny of  the other judges and to respond to any objections.\n\n33. The appeal procedure in the law o f t e n forcw out for more detailed examination the  underlying arguments,  and one must ask whether  the s o r t o f procedure we am suggesting should allow for  appeals and,  if s o , to  whom.  Without answering the f i r s t question, since we think that will depend upon local conditions, we can say that if there is  an  appeal  procedure,  it  ought  to  be  either back to  the  original  body  or  to  some comparable body, comparably constituted and equally concerned to elicit the reasons for one decision rather than another. If  the point is to provide arguments for each decision, and to do so  b e f o r e a body  properly constituted,  it  will satisfy neither end to allow an appeal procedure that dismisses either condition as not essential.\n34. We have in mind here such cases as Gideon v.  Wainwright, 372 U . S . 335, 83 S. Ct. 792 (1963). In Cideon, the Court decided that although indigent persons accused of crimes by  a  state were  entitled  to  lawyers to  represent  them, none of thosa who  had been convicted, except Gideon,  had  that  right. They weighed the cost of  granting the right to everyone convicted without a lawyer and especially the difficulty o f retrying all those, with the lapse of  years making evidence and testimony significantly less reliable. and  decided th a t justice  would no t be served by  making  the decision retroactive.  The decision w a s based on the high principle that any citizen likely to be incarcerated for a crime  is  entitled  to representation by a  lawysr, but  the  implications for  those a h d y incarcerated-that they were entitled to be let free because they had not had representation and so were  entitled  to  new  trials,  with  representation-were judged  contrary  to  the public good and to justice.\n\nAs decided cases are incorporated into the body of  law, new  cases arise, either because  of  dissatisfaction with  previous decisions or because  previous  decisions  give  rise  to  new  possibilities.  The  process works  to  expand  the  arguments for  competing  positions  and to encourage the fairness o f   the decisions. Previous decisions are subjected to  scrutiny once again, as positions are re-examined and  evaluated in light  o f their  actual  rather  than  predicted  consequences,  and  new judges, lawyers, plaintiffs, and defendants enter the process and bring with them fresh viewpoints and new arguments.\n\nThe legal process has its drawbacks. As Lon Fuller so nicely pointed out, it converts any problem into a conflict o f   claims and, as a decisionprocedure for settling disputes, squeezes out negotiations and so may prevent the best resolution o f   a c~nflict.~s Settling cases one at a time can lead one slowly into feeling compelled either to overrule precedent or to make what would appear, were it considered afresh, an inappropriate decision.3'  The capacity to make the correct decision in a particular case is in part, perhaps too much in part, a function of  the details of  the  particular  case that  comes before  the court, the  quality o f   the participants  in  the  case,  the  range  of  arguments  brought  before  the tribunal, and the strength and quality of  their presentation.\n\nAll  these failures may  occur, but  properly constructed, such a  procedure will more likely produce appropriate decisions than any alternative when the issues that pass through it themselves require contentious choices between competing  values.  One  may  object  that  when  one cannot decide which value  is the more weighty, the procedure is an odd  choice.  I f   one  does  not  know  how  to  accommodate competing values, how does it help to give the job of  accommodation to a standing committee? 'How,'  it may  be asked, 'can many confused people do a better job than  one confused person? Is not the analogy of the legal deliberations just a rather dressed-up version of  an ordinary committee, and  is  not the  appeal to  a  standing committee just  a  rather elaborate passing o f   the buck?'\n\n35 . [AJdjudication is a form o f decision that defines th e affected party's participation  as that of offiring proofs and reasoned argument. It is n o t 80 much that adjudicators  decide only issues presented by claims of  right or accusations. The point is rather that whatever they decide, or whatever i s submitted to them for decision,  tends to be  converted into a  claim of  right or an accusation o f   fault or guilt. This conversion is effected by the institutional framework within which both the litigant and the adjudicator function.\n\nLON FULLBR.

The example we have in mind consists of  a series of fi v e cases 80 designed that by the  time  one  reaches  the f i f t h case, one  will  be  faced  with  a  choice between two decisions and two principles,  each plausible and firmly grounded in precedent.

It is no wonder that negotiators for one side of a  conflict  are  reluctant  to  meet  with  those  for  the  other  or  that university  administrators are  reluctant  to  meet  in  a  committee with faculty and let the committee be  the final arbiter of  what  ought to  be done. Such a meeting itself legitimates the essential equality o f   all who take part. Thus, agreeing to a standing committee to resolve the problems of  funded research is agreeing to a governance structure in which respect for its deliberations and  its conclusions is possible.  For many institutions of  higher education, this means readjusting the longstanding relationships a~ various constituencies.\n\nVI .\n\nWho is to make the policy? The vaguest formulation  is that a  university make it.  But does that mean that the administration is to make the decision? Some portion of the administration? The faculty, voting by majority rule? Some portion of  the faculty, like a Faculty Senate, or a subcommittee of  such a Senate? The Board of  Trustees? Some portion of the Board? Each option presupposes a conception of  how a university ought to be constituted and where the power lies, or where it ought to lie.\n\nInstitutions of  higher education, whatever the structural differences among them,  are,  as a  class, oddly configured  when  compared with corporations or  with  partnerships  such  as  law h s . The  failure  of universities to grapple with certain oddities in their institutional character in large measure generated many o f   the modern problems hovering around university research policy.38\n\n38.

Getting a handle on just how universities are and ought to be structured is no easy matter. This is further complicated because those structures are themselves changing As the need for funding grows, presidents are required to spend more time courting money than faculty. This requires the creation of administrative   staffs devoted to  fund-raising. As the   need to respond to government regulation has increased and as universities have grown, administrative staffs have grown and a hierarchical   structure has posed itself, somewhat awkwardly, on what was a much more horizontal form of   participation.

It is not uncommon for members of a Board of Trustees to think of universities in thís way After all, many members are drawn the corporate world, in no small part because of the need for outside funding we have been talking about, and it never occurs to some of them that a university may be structured in a very different way Their contact is primarily with the President of the university and its various Vice-Presidents, and that limited perspective, may be misled into this misconception from from they\n\nIt is also, unfortunately all too common that presidents tend to think of universities in this way, and some of the messier affairs between new presidents and their institutions arise from the attempt to import into the academic setting the structure and trappings of the corporation. Among other things, the hierarchical structure makes for easier lines of responsibility and decision-making, and the association of presidents  with those with money (e.8. those in corporations, certainly not faculty) may subtly encourage certain sort of mind-set.\n\n- 41 We are particularly concerned to stress this point because of our own experience in arguing at RIT for the procedure we have suggested. In discussion with one member of the Board of Trustees, we were struck by a curious obstacle in the conversation. It was unwilling to relinquish   policy-making to some broaderbased procedure, but that he did not even understand the proposal. It must have seemed 80 alien as to be incomprehensible.\n\nWe should add, so that we are not misunderstood , that we would think it a mistake as well for faculty to argue either that as ought to make such decisions or that their representations to make decisions about funded research. Proper procedure mustcultivate an atmosphere in which all relevant considerations are adequately explored. body they ought\n\nOne need not envisage power-hungry Boards to understand why members sbould find it inappropriate to Bive up such policy-making; A member might bold the moral view that the Board will ultimately be beld responsible whatever an institution does and that it is of the Board'$ responsibility to set the broad outlines of policy; not to turn over such responsibility to any standing committee as we have suggested would be dereliction of duty. for part such\n\nmaking  rests  with  the  President  or  the  Board  of  Trustees.'* If  one conceives o f   the university as the body of  its faculty, one does not go too far in calling for a vote of  the faculty on the matter. B y   conceiving that decisions ought to be made in a certain way or by  a certain body, one is required to  conceive of  the governing  structure of  a university in a certain way.\n\nLaying  out  the  details results  in the  same  mistake  made  by  those institutions which lay down policy. On the one hand, the system is so complex, and the modes of  adjustment between the parts so many and varied, that changing one aspect will cause the others to adjust themselves. One cannot be sure what the wadjustment will produce. On the other hand, there are enough variations within the various institutions of   higher education that  choosing one model  for the  sort of  standing committee we recommend may not answer well a particular institution's long-term needs. To select one model is to suppose that all should be the same. Additionally, it is to suppose that universities are currently in a position to move without difficulty to that reconfiguration. Finally, it  supposes  that  a  single  structure  will  in  fact  produce  the  results supposed and, as Rawls would  put it, strengthen itself as it matures, whatever the institutional setting, deepening the commitment of  those within to its essential f01~m.43 Since we do not think that any of  these suppositions are true,  we  think  it  inappropriate to  argue for  one  canonical model for such decision-making.\n\nThe form of  such a standing committee is also a matter for decisio and as much a matter of  evolution as the principles for funded researc that  ought to  come  from  such a  committee's  deliberations.  The most we should do, and the best we can do, is to lay down a few guidelines for its construction.\n\nProviding  such ines  may  mislead  for  a  variety  of reasons. Creating such a committee does not require simply following a formula: get the right mix o f   constituencies within the academic communityfour faculty, three administrators, one student,  one staff member, and give them a meeting time, an agenda, and a deadline. Instead, creating such a committee requires that  an institution  come to  grips with  its\n\n42. This is arguably what happened a t RIT where the Resident handled the Institute's cont r a c t s and contacts with the CIA aut o f   his o f f i c e . He argued that this needed to be done on grounds  of national security, but  the  very  form  of  his  solution  to  what  he perceived to be a problem presupposed a governance structure of  the  Institute, M what he perceived to  be  a governance structure, that  allowed,  and  perhaps  even obligated, him as President to make such arrangements.\n\nSee Daniel  H.  Perlman, E t h i c a l Challenges of  the College and  University Presidency, in ETHICS ANI) HXGHER EDUCATION (WILLIAM W. MAY ED. 1990) for a helpful discussion o f the professional and moral obligations of  college and university presidents.\n\n43.  Rawls refen to the sustaining and deepening of  commitment as the problem of stability.  H e   builds  into  that  concept the  idea  that  a  system  becomes  more  and  more stable if  the  system encourages the  participants in the  system to  internalize its norms. See JOHN hW, A TIiEORY OF JUSTICE, 177-82  ( 1 9 7 1 ) .\n\ngovernance structure \\_ Our concern is not with the details, but with the understanding that behind the details lies a governance structure adequate to handle the problem and reflect its complexities.\"\n\nWhat is required is what we call the 'constitutional approach  ~ This approach depends upon two basic principles: a) university-wide acknowledgment   of a 'federated   separation  of powers\" (attended by system of checks and balances), together with b) hierarchically arranged rights and responsibilities that translate into a placement of decisionmaking rights within the federated separation of powers at the univerThis approach recognizes that the interests of the various constituencies of the university are best served by an understanding of the tensions inherent in the traditional  myth of academia and a public commitment to working out those tensions through a procedure such as we have described. Such understanding and commitment will require thorough examination of the current governance structure university.  Additionally, it require a restructuring that is appropriate to create such a standing committee as we have recommended and that is amenable to accepting any result of that committee's delibsity . will\n\nVII.\n\nBuried within the traditional myth of academia, we have suggested , is a tension   between the ideals of open inquiry\\_the increase and dissemination of knowledge~and the ideals of freedom of choice of academics. A thorough history would show that the tension has existed time and that neither set of ideals has ever been, Or could be, fully achieved. The tension shows more brilliantly these because of the increased need for external funding.  We suggest that a procedural device offers the best chance of coming to grips with this tension:  Standing committees can, over time, work their through particular  grant applications and give reasons for preferring one over long days way\n\nThis move is calculated to ''finesse\" the difficulties of making the hard choice between equally compelling values. Those values are required to meet and jostle in real cases and be settled by reasons that will survive the particularities of each meeting. The end result may be what we now No such procedural device, instituted within an ongoing system, can guarantee  structural changes in that system. But if its adoption is conceived as part of the larger issue of the fundamental have.\n\n44. For a review of procedures adopted by various institutions of higher education, see Eisenberg,  supra note 21.\n45. A result might be, for instance, that it is a mistake to allow research to take place outside the institution proper. [f university already has set up separate the university itself, such result will cause some severe wrenching within the university . We are not urging such result, but   pointing out that the sort of commitment we are urging may have that result. from\n\nconstitution regulating a university' s affairs, the likelihood for fundamental change is increased, and the result of that change will be the replacement of that traditional with  something else, something perhaps more nuanced to the realities of practice. myth",
