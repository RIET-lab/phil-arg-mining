They are not controlled by external forces or manipulated by outside agents. They set  goals  for  themselves,  establishing  principles  for  their  choices  and  actions,  and they are able to act in accord with those principles. Just as deliberative democracies legislate so as to balance competing interests, autonomous agents deliberate to reach some  consistency  among  their  competing  desires  and  values.  And  just  as  good governments  create  their  laws  in  the  open  without  undue  influence  by  covert factions,  autonomous  agents  form  their  principles  for  action  through  conscious deliberation without undue influence by unconscious forces. Autonomous agents are self-controlled not weak-willed, self-aware not self-deceptive. Given this description, it would be nice to be an autonomous agent.\n\nIndeed, we believe we are , for the most part, autonomous agents. 1 However, there are threats to this commonsense belief. Some philosophers argue that if causal determinism is true then we lack free will and hence are not fully autonomous or responsible for our actions. 2 One might also worry that if certain explanations of the mind-body relationship are true, then our conscious deliberations are epiphenomenal in such a way that we are not really autonomous. Philosophers also analyze political freedom and various socio-political threats to people's autonomy.\n\nBut  other  threats  to  autonomy  are  less  often  discussed,  threats  that  are  not metaphysical or political but psychological. These are threats based on putative facts about human psychology that suggest we do not govern our behavior according to principles we have consciously chosen. For instance, if our behavior were governed primarily by unconscious Freudian desires rather than by our reflectively considered desires, we would be much less autonomous than we presume. Or if our behaviors were  the  result  of  a  history  of  Skinnerian  reinforcement  rather  than  conscious consideration, our actions would be shaped by our environment more than by our principles. Since the influence of Freud and Skinner has waned, we might feel we have  escaped  such  threats  to  our  autonomy  from  the  psychology.  But,  as  I  will explain below, more recent and viable theories and evidence from social psychology pose significant threats to autonomous agency.\n\n## 1. AUTONOMOUS AGENCY\n\nIn this section I explain more fully what I mean by autonomous agency. In the following section, I outline the relevant research in social psychology, the ways it threatens our autonomy, and some responses to these threats.\n\nOn most conceptions  of  autonomous  agency  it  clearly  requires  freedom  of action, which is the ability to act on one's desires without external constraint. But such  freedom  is  not  sufficient  for  autonomy,  since  agents  may  also  be internally constrained or influenced by external factors in ways more subtle than constraint or coercion.  For  instance,  agents  may  act  on  addictions,  phobias,  or  even  strong passions that they would prefer not to move them. Or agents may be influenced by subtle manipulations (e.g., advertising) or by unrecognized situational factors (e.g., peer  pressure)  that,  had  the  agents  known  about  them,  they  would  not  want  to influence them. These cases suggest that autonomy requires more than simply being free  to  act  on  one's  desires;  it  also  requires  some  measure  of  internal  consistency among one's desires and values and some capacity to understand oneself and one's situation.  I will discuss these requirements in terms of principles and knowledge . 3\n\n## 1.1 Autonomy requires reflectively chosen principles\n\nWe adult humans are autonomous in ways that young children and animals are not. This is in part because we are often moved not simply by our strongest urge in a given situation; we are also able to consider our immediate desires in terms of our long-term goals, including our moral and social obligations. 4 However, it would be inefficient, if not impossible, to reflect on our goals and obligations every time we act. Rather, we tend to deliberate about such matters calmly and reflectively to establish the ways we hope to respond without much reflection when faced with the relevant situations. 5 This deliberation may take the form of counterfactual reasoning: when  I  am  in  situations  of  type X ,  I  should  do Y .  For  instance,  if  I  find  myself confronted with a person in need, I should respond by helping him; as I consider job applicants  I  should  ignore  irrelevant  information  and  focus  on  the  information  I deem important. The details may be left somewhat vague, but the goal is to establish principles for action, reasons that will guide you to act in particular ways in certain types  of  situations  so  that  you  act  consistently  with  your  reflectively  considered preferences, even when you do not or cannot consciously deliberate at the moment of action.\n\nHence, autonomous agency requires the ability to form and act on principles. The  formation  of  these  principles  should  occur  through  conscious  deliberation without the influence of any unconscious motivations the agent would reject if she knew about them. And the principles should be as internally consistent as possible so that the agent does not betray some of her own principles by acting on others.\n\nGiven this conception of autonomy, we can see that an agent's autonomy is threatened to the extent that she is ignorant of factors that lead her to act against her principles-i.e.,  were  she  to  recognize  these  factors,  she  would  reject  them.\n\nSimilarly, an agent's autonomy is threatened by rationalization : cases in which the agent finds herself acting against her consciously chosen principles but retrospectively comes up with reasons to justify her action. Here, actions inconsistent with  prior  principles  are  explained  (to  herself  and  others)  in  terms  of post hoc principles adjusted to fit the actions. 6 Of course, we are all subject to cases of  ignorance  and  rationalization.  But  are  we  subject  to  these  challenges  to  our autonomy to a greater extent than we realize?\n\n## 1.2 Autonomy requires knowledge\n\nThese  considerations  further  suggest  that  autonomy  depends  on  the  agent's ability  to  know  her  principles  and  to  know  how  to  act  on  them.  Ideally,  an autonomous agent can articulate to herself and others her principles for action. At a minimum, she can recognize whether she is acting on reasons she would accept were she to consider them. An agent's knowledge of her principles is unhelpful if she is unaware  of  the  motivational  states  or  external  factors  that  lead  her  to  act  against them.  Ignorance  of  such  factors  hinders  the  agent's  ability  to  counteract  their influence in order to act consistently with her principles. Finally, the agent has to know how to get herself to act according to her principles, even when she feels more motivated to act against them. Hence, autonomy requires some capacity to introspect accurately on one's motivations for action and to know why one acts as one does. To the extent that we do not know ourselves and our situations, we lack autonomy.\n\n## 1.3 Autonomy comes in degrees\n\nNotice  that  the  above  conditions  are  not  meant  to  provide  an analysis of autonomy;  I  do  not  know  what  the  complete  set  of  necessary  and  sufficient conditions  for  autonomy  would  be.  Rather,  I  have  described  these  conditions  in terms of degrees of satisfaction. Intuitively, different agents seem to possess more or less autonomy, and an agent seems to exercise more or less autonomy in different decisions  or  actions.  The  degree  to  which  agents  are  autonomous  seems  to  align nicely with the degree to which they know their own principles for action and know how  to  act  on  those  principles  (though  there  are  likely  other  conditions  I  have neglected). Accordingly, autonomy is compromised to the degree these conditions are compromised. 7\n\nSeeing autonomy in this way accords with our practices of attributing moral responsibility (e.g., praise and blame): we attribute responsibility to varying degrees depending in part on (1) the degree to which agents possess the relevant capacities to form and act on principles and (2) the degree to which agents have the opportunity to act on their principles. For instance, we hold children responsible to the degree that  they  have  matured  to  understand  their  reasons  for  acting,  and  we  hold  adults responsible to the degree that they are in a position to know their obligations and to control their actions accordingly. 8\n\nFinally,  this  view  allows  us  to  see  that  empirical  challenges  to  autonomy come in varying degrees. For instance, information about human psychology may suggest that we possess less autonomy than we think, without thereby suggesting we are entirely subject to forces beyond our control. Hence, one way to read the rest of my  discussion  is this: To  the degree that social psychology's  theories  and experimental results suggest limitations to the capacities required for autonomy, to that degree  our  autonomy  is  compromised.  My  main  goal  is  to  bring  attention  to these  largely  unnoticed  empirical  threats  to  autonomy  and  to  examine  their  depth and  scope.  These  points  will  reinforce  an  underlying  theme  of  this  chapter:  that autonomy  should  be  investigated  empirically  as  well  as  conceptually  and  that exploring  empirical  challenges  to  autonomy  and  responsibility  is  at  least as illuminating as debating would-be global threats such as determinism. 9\n\n## 2. THE THREAT OF SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY\n\nWe have seen, then, that an agent lacks autonomy to the extent that she is unable  to  know  her  own  motivations  or  reasons  for  action  or  to  know  what situational factors are influencing her to act against her principles. Furthermore, an agent lacks autonomy to the extent that she acts in conflict with principles she has adopted or acts on reasons she would reject if she were to consider them.\n\nResearch in social psychology over the past few decades suggests significant limitations to these conditions of autonomy. 10 Specifically, some social psychologists  have  interpreted  their  research  as  demonstrating  three  interrelated theses:\n\n- (1) The Principle of Situationism :  Our  behavior is  influenced to a significant and surprising  extent  by  external  situational  factors  that  we  do  not  recognize  and over which we have little control. These factors are often ones we would not want to have such influence on us if we knew about them.\n- (2) The Disappearance of the Character Traits : Internal dispositional states are not robust  or  stable  across  various  situations;  traditional  character  traits  are  not good predictors of behavior.  Hence, consistent principles we endorse or aspire to develop tend to be ineffective given the power of certain situational factors.\n- (3) The Errors of Folk Psychology and Introspection :  We generally do not know about the first two theses, and hence our explanations of our own and others' behaviors are based on mistaken folk theories or inaccurate introspection. Our introspection does not give us privileged access to what motivates us to act.\n\n## 2.1 Experiments and Implications\n\nIn order to clarify these theses, I will summarize some experimental results. 11 The most common experimental paradigm is simple.  The psychologists manipulate certain  factors  that  we  would  not  expect  to  influence  our  behavior.  But  the\n\nexperimental group, which is exposed to the manipulated factor, behaves significantly differently than the control group, indicating the influence of that factor on behavior. Meanwhile, behavior within each group is consistent enough to suggest that other factors-including personality traits-play no significant role in determining behavior. Often, subjects are then asked to explain why they behaved as they  did.  They  do  not  mention  the  manipulated  factor  as  having  played  any  role; rather, they mention other, more 'principled' reasons for their choices and actions. Some of these experiments involve relatively trivial behavior, in which case subjects may  feel  obliged  to  come  up  with  rationalizations  for  behaviors  that  are  not generally  guided  by  reflectively  chosen  principles. 12 However,  other  experiments involve situations in which most people presumably seek to act in accord with their reflectively  considered  principles.  I  will  focus  on  experiments  involving  morally relevant behavior.\n\n1)  In  1964  when  Kitty  Genovese  screamed  for  help  for  half  an  hour  while being stabbed and raped in Queens, the forty people who witnessed the event did not help or even call the police. Social psychologists began testing whether this lack of intervention may have been due to a situational factor-the number of bystanders present-rather than, as the media explained it, the inherent apathy and callousness of  New  Yorkers.  Numerous  experiments  showed  that  increasing  the  number  of people who witness an emergency or a person in distress decreases the chances that anyone will intervene. For instance, when subjects heard a woman take a bad fall, 70%  of  solitary  subjects  went  to  help,  but  if  subjects  sat  next  to  an  impassive confederate,  only  7%  intervened. 13 A  plausible  explanation  is  that  when  we  are around others, our perception of the situation alters; perceived responsibility to act is diffused by  the possibility that someone  else  will (or might)  take action. 14 Confounding the problem, if no one does take action, we construe the situation as less serious-if no one is reacting, it must not be so bad after all. 15\n\nBut  people  do  not recognize these  group  effects:  'We  asked  this  question every way we knew how: subtly, directly, tactfully, bluntly. Always we got the same answer. Subjects persistently claimed that their behavior was not influenced by the other people present. This denial occurred in the face of evidence showing that the presence  of  others  did  inhibit  helping'. 16 Rather,  when  asked,  subjects,  like  the media, refer to dispositional traits (e.g., apathy or altruism) to explain their own and others' behavior-traits that do not significantly correspond with people's behavior-or they refer to their perception of the situation, which is skewed by a situational factor they do not recognize as influencing them. Presumably, people's refusal to admit the influence of group effects is an indication that they do not accept it as a legitimate influence. Rather, the principles they articulate refer to dispositions to  respond  to  those  in  need  based  primarily  on  how  great  the  perceived  need  is. Hence, it appears that people can fail to act on their principles because of situational factors they don't recognize or accept as reasons to act.\n\n2) In another experiment Princeton seminary students were asked to prepare a lecture either on the parable of the Good Samaritan or on their job prospects.  Some\n\nsubjects were told they were late getting to the lecture hall while others were not. En route, they came upon a man slumped in a doorway, coughing and groaning (as in the Biblical story).  While 63% of the 'early' subjects offered help, only 10% of the 'late'  subjects  assisted  the  man  in  need.  No  significant  correlations  were  found between the subjects' helping behavior and their self-reported personality traits or the subject matter of their lecture. 17 The 'hurry' factor influenced some subjects by changing their perception of the situation: 'because of time pressures, they did not perceive the scene in the alley as an occasion for ethical decision'. 18 Again, people are not aware of the influence of this situational factor on their perception or their behavior. 19 Even if people consider themselves altruistic, even if they prefer not to be affected by factors (like being in a hurry) that they view as irrelevant to helping those in need, it is difficult to see how they can consciously override the influence of factors they do not believe influence them.\n\n- 3) A study by Isen and Levin showed that subjects who found a dime in a payphone, and hence got a 'mood boost', were then fourteen times more likely to help  a  passerby  pick  up  dropped  papers  than  subjects  who  did  not  find  a  dime. 20 Again, no one predicts or desires that their helping behavior is influenced by such seemingly irrelevant factors.\n- 4)  Finally,  the  well-known  Stanley  Milgram  obedience  studies  consistently found  that  about  two-thirds  of  subjects  will  shock  a  man  into  unconsciousness during a learning experiment. 21 Situationists  suggest  that  the  incremental  levels  of the shocks (15-volts) make it difficult for subjects to find a justifiable point at which to  question  the  authority  of  the  experimenter. 22 People  certainly  do  not  predict  of themselves that they would continue well past the point that the learner appears to go  unconscious  to  the  450-volt  switch  marked  'Danger:  XXX'.  We  assume  our principles  would preclude us from performing such actions.  And no one predicts that so many others would do it either. 23\n\nIn  each  of  the  above  experiments  people's  explanations  for  their  own  and others'  behavior  refer  to  character  traits  or  principled  reasons  while  ignoring  the situational  factors  that  in  fact  make  the  significant  difference.  That  is,  people  are ignorant of  significant  causes  of  their  behavior  and,  if  asked  to  explain  their behavior, they tend to offer rationalizations ,  confabulating  reasons  to  try  to  make sense of their behavior. 24 Psychologist Roger Schank summarizes the general idea: 'We do not  know how we decide  things  [â€¦].  Decisions  are  made  for  us  by  our unconscious;  the  conscious  is  in  charge  of  making  up  reasons  for  those  decisions which sound rational'. 25\n\nTo  the  extent  that  situational  factors  play  a  large  role  in  determining  our behavior,  differences  in  people's  internal  dispositions  appear  to  play  a  relatively small role. That is, if a particular situational factor (such as finding a dime) can elicit similar  behavior  from  most  subjects,  then,  it  is  claimed,  differences  between individuals' characters are correspondingly insignificant in producing their behavior. The question of whether this work in social psychology implies an elimination of\n\ncharacter traits is controversial both within social psychology and in philosophical reactions to it. 26 I  will  not  try  to  adjudicate  that  debate.  I  will  simply  suggest  that even if elimination is not warranted, to the extent that character traits play less of a role in our behavior that we ordinarily suppose, this would threaten our autonomy to the extent we do not then act on consistent principles we endorse. 27\n\nIn  addition  to  experiments  like  those  described  above,  the  evidence  for  the 'disappearance of character traits' comes from experiments that test for correlations in  subjects'  behavior  across  various  situations  designed  to  elicit  trait-relevant responses  (e.g.,  honesty,  extroversion,  impulsivity).  For  instance,  Hartshorne  and May tested students for honesty by examining their willingness to steal money, lie, and cheat on a test. 28 While the subjects behaved similarly in repeated cases of any one of these situations, they did not behave consistently across these situations; for instance, knowing that a particular student cheated on a test did not reliably indicate whether  he  would  steal  or  lie.    In  general,  people  predict  a  very  high  correlation between  character  trait  descriptions and  behaviors  in  relevant  'trait-eliciting' situations, but such correlations in fact hit a very low 'predictability ceiling'. 29 In other words, if we want to understand why an agent does what he does in situation X , we are better off either looking at his past behavior in situations just like X or at the way most people behave in X than we are considering what we take to be the agent's relevant character traits.\n\nSuch  conclusions  raise  a  problem  for  autonomy  because  the  principles  we adopt  for  our  own  behavior  are  usually  not  so  situation-specific;  rather  they  look more like character traits that will dispose us to feel and respond to a wide range of situations  in  an  appropriate  way.  To  act  on  a  principle  of  honesty  requires overcoming  inclinations  to  lie  or  cheat  across  a  range  of  situations  where  such behavior is inappropriate. We do not usually form situation-specific principles, such as the desire to help people specifically when we are not in a hurry. 30 Rather, we aim to develop consistent tendencies to respond to the aspects of situations that call for traits such as altruism, generosity, courage, or diligence. The more these tendencies can be disrupted by unrecognized variations in situational factors that we don't want to influence us, the less consistent we will be. And the less we recognize how easily these tendencies can be disrupted, the less we can make conscious efforts to shore them up in order to act consistently. 31\n\nTo the extent that the dispositional traits we identify as our principles do not in  fact  correspond  with  consistent  behavior,  we  are  identifying  ourselves  with constructed concepts rather than actual motivational states. This limits the influence of  our  principles  on  our  actions.  If  future  behavior  cannot  be  accurately  predicted based on the possession of a character trait, then adopting a principle to act on that trait  appears  fruitless.  I  may  reflectively  endorse  being  generous  but  doing  so appears  to  be  ineffective  to  the  extent  that  (1)  I  cannot  predict  how  I  will  be influenced  by  situational  factors  that  vary  across  different  'giving'  opportunities, and  (2)  there  is  no  such  trait  as  generosity  to  cultivate.  Research  in  social psychology  suggesting  the  disappearance  of  character  traits  thus  threatens  our autonomy  to  the  extent  that  it  suggests  limitations  on  our  capacities  to  form consistent principles for action and to know how to act on our principles.\n\nSuch research also suggests a more systematic limitation to our knowledge. If we tend to explain human behavior in terms of character traits while being ignorant of  the  influence  of  unnoticed  situational  influences,  then  this  suggests  that  our explanations  and  predictions  of  our  own  and  others'  behavior  will  often  be inaccurate. Furthermore, on this view, our introspective reports about why we feel and act as we do are based on our (largely inaccurate) folk theories rather than any direct access to our own mental processes. Social psychologists argue that our folk psychology suffers from the fundamental attribution error , 'people's inflated belief in the importance of personality traits and dispositions, together with their failure to recognize the importance of situational factors in affecting behavior'. 32 Then, they suggest, when we introspect on why we feel or act as we do, we grasp for the most plausible folk psychological explanation, rather than accurately introspecting on our own mental states: 'The accuracy of subjective reports is so poor as to suggest that any  [introspective]  access  that  may  exist  is  not  sufficient  to  produce  generally correct and reliable reports'. 33\n\nThere are numerous social psychology experiments suggesting that our folk psychology and our introspection are inaccurate. 34 I'll describe just one to illustrate the  threat  to  autonomy.  Nisbett  and  Bellows  asked  college  students  to  assess  a candidate, Jill, for a counseling job. 35 Subjects judged Jill according to four criteria ('likeability', 'intelligence', 'sympathy', and 'flexibility') after they read a threepage application file with information about her life, her qualifications, and a prior interview with her. Five factors in Jill's file were manipulated across different sets of subjects: (1) whether Jill was described as attractive, (2) whether she had superior academic credentials, (3) whether she had spilled coffee during her interview, (4) whether she had recently been in a car accident, and (5) whether the subject was told he or she would later meet Jill. After judging Jill on the four criteria, subjects were then asked to introspect about how much each of these factors had influenced their judgments on each of the criteria. 36\n\nThe results show that the subjects' introspective reports rarely correlated with the actual effect the various factors had, as  determined  by  between-subject comparisons (with one exception: academic credentials did influence judgments of intelligence  just  as  subjects  reported).  (See  Figure  13.1).  For  instance,  subjects reported  that  whether  Jill  had  been  in  an  accident  had  the  greatest  effect  on  their judgments of her sympathy and that her academic credentials had the greatest effect on  how  much  they  liked  her,  but  when  the  manipulated  factors  were  compared across  subjects'  judgments,  it  turned  out  that  these  introspective  reports  were inaccurate; instead, believing they would meet Jill had, by far, the strongest effect on subjects' judgments of her sympathy (as well as her flexibility) and reading that Jill spilled coffee in her interview had the strongest effect on how much they liked her!\n\nFigure 13.1. Nisbett and Bellows' (1977) experiment. Bold line represents actual effects of manipulated factors (on X-axis) on judgments (Y-axis) as measured across 'actor' subjects; circle  line  represents  reports  by  'actor'  subjects  about  the  effects  of  the  factors  on  their judgments; and triangle line represents predictions by 'observer' subjects about the effects the  factors would have  on  their  judgments.  Reproduced  from  Nisbett  and  Bellows  (1977, 619).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA second group of subjects was asked simply to imagine they were judging some unspecified candidate for an unspecified job and, without actually viewing any information, they rated how important the five factors (appearance, academics, etc.) would be to their judgments on the four criteria (likeability, sympathy, etc.). These subjects' predictions were statistically identical to-and hence as inaccurate as-the reports  by  the  subjects  who  actually  considered  the  information  about  Jill  (see Figure  13.1).  The  authors  interpret  these  results  as  showing  that  the  introspecting subjects did not actually make their judgments based on the reasons they reported. Rather,  they  were  unaware  of  how  various  factors  influenced  most  of  their judgments,  and  they  retrospectively  theorized  about  what  influenced  them  in  the same  way  the  uninformed  subjects  theorized  about  what  factors would influence them. And in both cases, the theories were generally mistaken. In the one case where\n\nthe theories were accurate, it is because the connection  between academic credentials and intelligence fits plausible cultural norms about such judgments: the authors explain, '[v]erbal reports should be correct wherever there exists a correct causal  theory,  correctly  applied  in  the  particular  instance', 37 but  'introspection played little  part  in  subject  reports'. 38 Social  psychologists hence suggest that our introspection  about  why  we  do  what  we  do  looks  more  like theoretical reasoning about what someone might do in our circumstances.\n\nNisbett  and  Wilson  conclude  from  such  experiments:  'It  is  frightening  to believe that one has no more certain knowledge of the workings of one's own mind than would an outsider with intimate knowledge of one's history and of the stimuli present  at  the  time  the  cognitive  processes  occurred'. 39 Indeed  it is frightening, because  our  autonomy  is  compromised  if  it  turns  out  that  what  we  think  we  are doing  when  we  introspect  on  the  reasons  we  act  does  not  in  fact  involve  reliable access  to  our  principles,  but  instead  involves  'just  so'  stories  derived  from  our inaccurate folk psychology. The threat appears graver still if psychologists develop theories to predict our own behavior better than we ourselves can, since prediction goes hand in hand with control.\n\nLet  me  be  more  precise  about  the  threats  to  autonomy  posed  by  such research.  In  these  experiments,  when  subjects  offer  reasons  for  their  attitudes  and actions,  they  are  usually  doing  two  things:  (1)  claiming  that  those  factors  have causally  influenced  them, and (2)  explaining  the  factors  they  think justify their attitudes and actions. For example, when subjects report that knowing Jill has been in an accident made them more likely to see her as sympathetic, they are presumably explaining not only the influence of that factor but also their view that its influence is  legitimate  (e.g.,  she'll  understand  suffering  better).  Conversely,  when  subjects report  that  Jill's  spilling  coffee  was not a  factor  in  their  rating  of  how  much  they liked her, they are reporting that they think it had no influence on them and also that they think it should have no influence on them-clumsiness is not a good reason to like (or dislike) Jill. 40 In such cases, the reasons subjects report as the basis of their judgments  often  accords  with  principles  they  accept  (or  would  accept).  However, these  experiments  indicate  that  factors  the  subjects  see  as  irrelevant  are  in  fact influential  while  most  factors  they  see  as  important  are not .  To  the  extent  such results can be generalized, it seems that the reasons we offer as explanations for our behavior look more like retrospective rationalizations.\n\nFurthermore, such experiments suggest limitations on our knowledge of how to influence our actions to accord with our principles. For each unrecognized effect on our motivations and actions, our deliberations about how to influence our future actions are correspondingly restricted. For instance, if you're hiring someone for a job, you'd likely deliberate about which criteria are important to you and how you will determine if candidates meet those criteria. But it seems your judgments may often be affected by unrecognized factors that you would not want to be influential, such as the candidate's appearance or whether they spill coffee at the interview. 41 The less accurate your knowledge of which factors might influence you, the less you can control the influence of those factors you want to make a difference-that is, the less you can act on your principles.\n\n## 2.2 Responses to the Threat of Social Psychology\n\nI  have  presented  these  experimental  results  and  interpretations  from  the perspective of the social psychologists in order to highlight the challenges they pose to autonomous agency. But I will now suggest some avenues for responding to their interpretations  so  that  we  might  defend  our  autonomy  against  these  threats. 42 My main goal has been to show why the degree to which we are autonomous agents is, in large part, an empirical question. But I will now suggest that it remains, in large part, an open question.\n\nFirst  of  all,  the  extent  of  human  actions  to  which  the  social  psychology evidence applies remains unknown. For instance, these experiments usually involve complex experimental set-ups, designed precisely to 'trick' subjects, who are doing things without being asked to attend to what they are doing. In some cases there is little reason to think subjects care about the activities being studied, so they may not really  have  what  they  see  as  reasons  for  what  they  do-they  only  come  up  with reasons  when  asked  to. 43 Perhaps  some  of  our  more  considered  actions  are  less subject to situational effects.  And some the situational effects will surely involve the  salient  aspects  of  the  situations,  the  very  ones  we  get  ourselves  into  by consciously choosing to do so.  For instance, when someone deliberatively settles on becoming an ER doctor,  they  are  knowingly  putting  themselves  in  situations  that will  lead  them  to  help  people  in  distress.  A  reflective  decision  to  become  a professional philosopher includes a decision to be in many fewer such situations.\n\nFurthermore, in the experiments subjects are asked to explain their judgments or  responses  only after they  complete  them.  When  the  subjects  report  their experiences, they are not introspecting but retro specting on processes they performed earlier during the task. Perhaps subjects' poor  memory of the thoughts they had accounts for some of the problems ascribed to their poor introspection. 44 None  of  these  experiments  ask  subjects  to  consider  what  principles  they  want  to influence them before they act, in order to determine whether such deliberation can counteract  the  disconnect  between  subjects'  reported  reasons  and  their  actions.  It would be helpful to test what would happen if subjects were asked to consider their principles of action before they engage in the relevant behavior. 45 Experiments that test  for  the  effect  of  prior  introspection  are  needed  to  determine  the  influence  of conscious deliberation about one's principles.\n\nIn fact, some experiments have tried  to  determine  the  effect  of  one  type  of prior  introspection  on  one's  behavior.  These  experiments,  however,  suggest  that introspecting on the reasons for our attitudes can be disadvantageous. Specifically, they imply that when subjects introspect about why they feel the way they do about something, they may not access the actual reasons for their feelings but instead come up  with  what  they  think  are  plausible  reasons,  and  this  disrupts  the  consistency between the  feelings  they  then  report  and  their  subsequent  actions,  and  they  may even make choices they later regret. The upshot, according to Timothy Wilson, is that  'self-reflection  may  not  always  be  a  beneficial  activity';  indeed,  'at  least  at times, the unexamined choice is worth making'. 46\n\nFor  example,  one  experiment  asked  dating  couples  to  report  their  feelings about their relationship, including how long they thought it would last. But one set of subjects was first asked to introspect on the reasons for their feelings about their relationship, while control subjects just reported their attitudes without introspecting on them. The correlation between subjects' reported attitudes (e.g., how long they thought the relationship would last) and their behavior (i.e., whether they were still dating  several  months  later)  was  significantly  lower  (.10)  for  those  subjects  that introspected than for the controls (.62). 47 As Wilson interprets it, the introspecting subjects came up with what they saw as plausible reasons for their feelings but they did not have direct access to the actual reasons they felt as they did. These subjects then adjusted their reported attitudes to match the reasons they had thought up so that  their  behavior,  motivated  by  their  'real'  attitudes,  did  not  then  match  their introspective reports.\n\nThe problem raised by this experiment (and others like it 48 ) is not only that it provides  more  evidence  that  we  are  often  mistaken  in  our  explanations  for  our actions and attitudes, but also that it suggests we often act on motivations we have not  considered  and  which,  in  fact,  we  might  not  accept  as  principles  for  action. Luckily,  in  this  case,  there  is  actually  some  experimental  evidence  that  limits  the scope of such research. In the dating study and others like it, when the experimenters controlled for subjects' knowledge (e.g., whether the partners knew each other well), they found that knowledgeable subjects did not face  the  problem  of  inconsistency after introspecting on their attitudes. That is, the behavioral measure aligned much more  closely  with  the  attitudes  subjects  reported  based  on  their  introspected reasons. 49 Such studies suggest that when subjects know and care about the relevant issue,  they  seem  to  have already considered  the  principles  they  want  to  motivate their  behavior.  So,  unlike  unknowledgeable  subjects,  they  need  not  adjust  their attitudes to match reasons they come up with on the spot. They already have good reasons  and  their  attitudes  and  behaviors  reflect  these  reasons.    In  such  cases,  it seems we have deliberated about our reasons for feeling and acting as we do, and these deliberations have 'sunk in' so that our actions align with our principles.  Our introspection  on  our  reasons  does  not  disrupt  our  attitudes-rather,  we  revisit  a pattern of reasoning we have already made our own.\n\nThis  is  consistent  with  my  account  of  autonomy,  because  it  suggests  that increased knowledge of the world and ourselves increases our ability to act in accord with our principles. 50 And it suggests that reflective consideration of one's principles is  the  first  step  in getting oneself to act on them. When unknowledgeable subjects introspect on their reasons, they are trying to locate their reasons for the first time, trying  to  justify  their  attitudes;  it  is  not  surprising  that  their  behavior  does  not immediately match these reasons. But such introspection may initiate the process of disrupting  and  overcoming  habitual  behavior  and  unconsidered  motivations  that don't accord with the principles the agent would accept. 51\n\nMy  reason  for  examining  the  social  psychology  research  has  not  been  to conclude that it shows we are not autonomous agents. Rather, my aim has been to bring attention to some implications of social psychology that have not been fully examined  and  to  illustrate  that  the  scope  of  our  autonomy  can  and  should  be\n\nexamined empirically. While the research I have examined does suggest important limitations to our autonomy, more experiments are required to learn when and how conscious consideration of our principles makes a difference in our behavior. Too few  experiments  have  dealt  with  attitudes  and  actions  we  care  about,  whose outcomes are of direct relevance to our significant interests and goals. And too few have examined how prior deliberation about how we want to be influenced affects what we in fact do.\n\nBut regardless of these shortcomings, social psychology  offers useful paradigms and starting points for the empirical investigation of what has for too long been designated a merely conceptual issue, the nature and scope of our autonomy. 52\n\n## NOTES\n\n- 1 Below I explain why autonomy is best understood as a property agents may possess and exercise to varying degrees.\n- 2 The connections between the concepts of autonomy, free will, and moral responsibility are complicated, in part by the variety of ways philosophers use each of them.  Though I will not defend it here, I believe an adequate account of autonomous agency will be sufficient as an account of free and morally responsible agency, and my discussion may be read in this way. See Taylor (2005).\n- 3 For accounts of autonomy that suggest some of the features I outline, see Frankfurt (1988; 1999),  Dworkin  (1988),  Taylor  ([1977]  1982),  Wolf  (1990),  Watson  (1975),  Mele  (1995), Christman (1991), Bratman (1987) and Fischer and Ravizza (1998). Some of these accounts, however, are described in terms of conditions required for free agency or morally responsible agency rather than autonomous agency (see note 2).\n- 4 That we often take on such obligations without coercion suggests, somewhat paradoxically, that autonomy can include being governed by a form of external control so long as the agent autonomously accedes to such control.\n- 5 Regret facilitates such deliberation about how to act differently next time around. Watson (1975) discusses the importance of acting on one's values , 'those principles and ends which [the agent]-in a cool and non-self-deceptive moment-articulates as definitive of the good, fulfilling, and defensible life' (105).\n- 6 Such rationalization may be difficult to distinguish from cases where the agent modifies her principles  in  light  of  her  actions  or  their  outcomes.    One  way  to  test  whether  an  agent  is rationalizing her actions with principles she does not really hold is to see whether or not she accepts those principles at other times and in relevantly similar situations.\n- 7 Cases  become  complicated  when  the  agent  knowingly  chooses  to  do  something  that  will compromise his opportunity to satisfy these conditions in his later actions.  For instance, he may autonomously take drugs knowing it will compromise his ability to act autonomously. Hence, we sometimes attribute responsibility to an agent's actions that were not autonomously performed (e.g., when he lacks knowledge or control), because those actions are 'traceable' to actions or choices that he did perform autonomously (e.g., many cases of drunk driving).\n- 8 This  explains  why  we  mitigate  an  agent's  responsibility  when  he  is  ignorant  of  his obligations or the consequences of his actions (where such ignorance is not itself culpablesee previous note), or when he is under extreme emotional duress or cognitive load.\n\n- 9 Elsewhere  I  examine  similar  empirical  challenges  to  autonomy  (or  free  will)  from  other sciences that explore human nature, such as evolutionary psychology or neurobiology, each of which suggests certain limitations on our knowledge of and control over our motivations and behaviors.  See, e.g., Libet (1983), Wegner (2002), and Nahmias (2002).\n- 10 I should note that social psychology is a diverse field; the work I discuss represents selected elements  within  it,  notably  the  'situationist'  camp  led  by  researchers  such  as  Lee  Ross, Richard Nisbett, Timothy Wilson and their collaborators.  For objections to the situationist paradigm,  see,  e.g.,  Sabini,  Siepmann,  and  Stein  (2001),  Krueger  and  Funder  (2004),  and Cotton (1980).  For more detailed discussions of the implications of this research for free will and responsibility, see Nahmias (in prep.), Doris (2002) and Nelkin (in press).\n- 11 For  extensive  reviews  of  such  experiments,  see  Nisbett  and  Wilson  (1977),  Ross  and Nisbett (1991), and Wilson (2002).\n- 12 For example, the position effect: presented with identical products, consumers tend to select the ones to the right, but they reject the role of position in their decision, instead coming up with reasons why they think the selected product is better than the other (identical) ones. See Ross and Nisbett (1991, 30-32). See Spinner (1981) for discussion of the distorting effects of demand conditions (i.e., subjects' being asked to explain their actions).\n- 13 See  Latane  and  Darley  (1968,  1970)  and  Ross  and  Nisbett  (1991,  42).  In  another experiment,  when solitary subjects  heard  an  experimenter  feign  an  epileptic  seizure,  85% intervened;  when  subjects  believed  there  was  one  other  subject  listening,  62%  intervened; when  they  believed  there  were  four  other  subjects,  31%  intervened.  And  in  all  these experiments, interventions occurred faster when there were fewer subjects.\n- 14 A  woman who heard Genovese screaming explained, 'I didn't let' my husband call the police; 'I told him there must have been 30 calls already'.\n- 15 Post-experiment  interviews  suggest  this  interpretation:  subjects  in  groups  describe  the emergencies in different terms (e.g., the fall victim's 'cries' become 'complaints') and notice them more slowly than subjects who are alone. Subjects also may want to avoid embarrassing themselves  by  taking  action  when  no  one  else  seems  to  think  something  should  be  done, though in some experiments subjects could not even see how others were reacting.\n- 16 Latane and Darley (1970, 124).\n- 17 Darley and Batson (1973).\n- 18 Ibid . , 108.\n- 19 See Pietromonaco and Nisbett (1982); they describe to subjects the Good Samaritan study and then ask them to predict the outcomes.  Subjects predict that the majority of  seminary students would stop to help in all conditions, but that 20% more would help if their religious calling was based on a desire to help others.  Subjects thought that being in a hurry would make no difference to whether the seminary students helped.\n- 20 Isen and Levin (1972). See Miller (2004, appendix) for some confounding factors regarding these experiments.\n- 21 See Milgram (1969).\n- 22 See Ross and Nisbett (1991, 56-58).  This interpretation is strengthened by the fact that of the  subjects  who do stop  the  experiment,  most  do  so  when  the  'learner'  appears  to  go unconscious (at 300 volts), a point where they can offer a justification for stopping. Many other  factors  have  been  shown not to  correlate  with  subjects'  behavior  in  the  experiment, including gender, age, socioeconomic  status, national origin, and various personality measures.\n\n- 23 After having the experiment described to them, psychologists predicted that only 2% of the subjects would continue to the end.\n- 24 However,  in  some  cases  subjects  act  so  inconsistently  with  their  principles  that  they disassociate themselves from their behavior, expressing surprise and dismay at their actions. This happened with some of Milgram's subjects, and in another famous situationist study, the Zimbardo prison experiments, where subjects given the role of prison guard became so cruel and  aggressive  that  the  experiment  had  to  be  terminated.  Though  some  guards  offered justifications  for  their  behavior,  one  self-described  pacifist  said  of  his  force-feeding  a prisoner, 'I don't believe it is me doing it,' and another said, 'I was surprised at myself. I was a  real  crumb' (Doris 2001, 51-53). Comparisons with the behavior of American soldiers at Abu  Ghraib  seem  apt  (see  Nelkin,  in  press).    In  fact,  Zimbardo  recently  testified  in  their defense  and  wrote  that  the  prison  guards  'had  surrendered  their  free  will  and  personal responsibility  during  these  episodes  of  mayhem  [â€¦].  [They]  were  trapped  in  a  unique situation in which the behavioral context came to dominate individual dispositions, values and morality to such an extent that they were transformed into mindless actors alienated from their normal sense of personal accountability' (www.edge.org).\n- 25 Quoted at www.edge.org.\n- 26 See,  e.g.,  Ross  and  Nisbett  (1991,  chapter  4);  Doris  (1998  and  2001);  Harman  (1999); Flanagan (1991, chapter 13); Merritt (2000); Miller (2003); Kamtekar (2004).\n- 27 Despite  some  similarities  between  the  situationists  and  the  more  radical  behaviorist tradition-notably the shared claim that environmental conditions play a significant role in human behavior-the situationists do recognize the importance of internal cognitive states, namely  people's  perceptual  and  motivational  construal  of  their  situations.  However,  these dispositions to perceive situations in certain ways are relatively specific and do not support the attribution of recognized character traits.\n- 28 Hartshorne and May (1928).\n- 29 Ross and Nisbett describe this 'maximum statistical correlation of .30 between measured individual  differences  on  a  given  trait  dimension  and  behavior  in  a  novel  situation  that plausibly tests that dimension [as] an upper limit. For most novel behaviors in most domains, psychologists cannot come close to that' (1991, 3).\n- 30 This is not to say that we don't aim to have principles that are open-ended and flexible, but we aim for them to be responsive to factors whose influence we accept or would accept, not to ones whose influence we don't recognize and would not accept if we did recognize it.\n- 31 It  is  this  challenge to character traits that leads some philosophers-notably, Doris (1998 and 2001) and Harman (1999)-to suggest that social psychology challenges virtue ethical theories since they appear to require the possibility of robust character traits.\n- 32 Ross  and  Nisbett  (1991,  4).  That  we  tend  to  refer  to  character  traits  in  explaining behaviors-especially others' behaviors-is a claim informed by experimental research, not just intuition (See ibid., chapter 5). The basic idea is that we attend to other people-dynamic and interesting as they are-and not to their environments-seemingly static and boring as they are-so that we attribute causal power to agents (the word 'agent' itself suggests this) rather than to the situational factors that influence agents.\n- 33 Nisbett  and  Wilson  (1977,  233).  Their  explanation  for  our  successful  cases  in predicting others' behavior is that we usually interact with people in similar situations over time.  And our explanations of our own  behavior  are  accurate 'due  to the incidentally correct employment of [folk] theories' (233).\n\n- 34 See Nisbett and Wilson (1977); Ross and Nisbett (1991); Wilson (2002).\n- 35 Nisbett and Bellows (1977).\n- 36 Since each subject was exposed to four of the five factors, each offered 16 self-reports (one for each of the four factors' affect on each of the four judgments about Jill-i.e., likeability, intelligence, sympathy, and flexibility).\n- 37 Nisbett and Bellows (1977, 614).\n- 38 Ibid., 623.\n- 39 Nisbett and Wilson (1977, 257).\n- 40 Reported causal influences will not always be offered as justifications; for instance, some people may recognize that attractiveness influences their judgments of 'likeability' but not accept that influence as a good reason.\n- 41 Ross and Nisbett (1991, 136-138) discuss the 'interview illusion': whereas subjects believe interviews  will  correlate  with  performance  at  a  rate  of  0.6,  the  actual  correlation  between judgments based on interviews and later job performance is usually below 0.1.\n- 42 One  response  I  will  not  explore  here  is  that  this  research  is  empirically  or  conceptually flawed.  For some suggestions that it is, see references in note 10.\n- 43 Many studies deal with consumer choices, or puzzles, or quickly made choices.  In fact, I have  found  only  one  experiment,  a  dating  study  discussed  below,  in  which  subjects  are reasoning about something that will have any direct impact on their own lives.\n- 44 Ericsson  and  Simon's Protocol  Analysis (1984)  shows  that  concurrent  introspection  is much more accurate than retrospection.\n- 45 For  instance,  in  the  job  interview  study,  presumably,  many  subjects  had  at  some  point thought about the influence academic credentials should have on judgments of intelligence, and perhaps-just as they report-those thoughts did play a role in those judgments.\n- 46 Wilson and Schooler (1991, 192). See also Wilson (2002).\n- 47 Wilson et al. (1989). One might suggest that we do not expect or care to be able to offer accurate reasons for our romantic feelings (that the idea of justifying one's love seems wrong). However,  we  do  offer  reasons  (to  ourselves,  friends,  and  family)  for  why  we  are  in  the relationships  we  are  in,  and  presumably,  we  want  those  reasons  to  bear  some  relation  to reality,  and  we  do not want  the  act  of  coming  up  with  such  reasons  to  disturb  our  actual feelings.\n- 48 For  instance,  a  study  on  voting  behavior  showed  that  subjects  who  introspected  on  why they  liked  or  disliked  candidates  before  reporting  their  attitudes  thereby  disrupted  their reported attitudes so that their behavior correlated with their reported attitudes significantly less than it did in controls who did not introspect: -0.43 vs. 0.46 (Wilson et al. 1989).\n- 49 In  the  dating  study,  for  introspecting  subjects  who  knew  their  partner  well,  behavior correlated  with  reported  attitudes  at  0.56,  compared  with  -0.19  for  subjects  who  had  been dating a short time (Wilson et  al. 1984). In the voting study cited in the previous note, for subjects who knew a good deal about politics, the correlation between reported attitudes and behavior was 0.53 (Wilson et al. 1989).\n\n50 In fact, knowledge of the social psychology evidence itself might increase our autonomy (1) by improving our ability to attend to situational influences we tend to overlook (see Beaman, Barnes, and McQuirk 1978; see Pietromonaco and Nisbett 1992), (2) by informing us about how to manipulate our environment to increase the likelihood that we act on our principles (e.g.,  'channeling factors' are subtle changes in environment that can significantly increase\n\nour ability to carry out planned actions), and (3) by decreasing our confidence in the strength of  our  character  traits  so  that  we  do  not  rely  on  them  to  guide  us  successfully  through tempting situations (see Doris 1998).\n\n51 See Holt (1989; 1993).\n\n52 This chapter is drawn from ideas developed over a number of years and with feedback from many audiences and friends to whom I am grateful.
