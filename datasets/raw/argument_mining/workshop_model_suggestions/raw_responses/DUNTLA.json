    "user_content": "## Toland, Leibniz, and Active Matter 1\n\n## Stewart Duncan\n\n20 March 2009\n\nIn the early years of the eighteenth century Leibniz had several interactions with John Toland. These included, from 1702 to 1704, discussions of materialism. Those discussions culminated with the consideration of TolandÕs 1704 Letters to Serena . 2 In the fourth letter, Toland argued that Spinoza could not account for the presence of motion in the world. In the fifth letter, Toland argued that matter is necessarily active. Leibniz read relevant parts of TolandÕs book, and commented on these two arguments.\n\nTolandÕs active matter view Ð like CudworthÕs belief in plastic natures Ð placed him intriguingly between Hobbes and Leibniz. For Toland was clearly attracted to something like Hobbesian materialism. But Toland also claimed, in a somewhat Leibnizian way, that the minimal Hobbesian picture is inadequate, and there must be more basic structure in the world. In particular, he thought, we need to acknowledge that matter is not only necessarily extended and solid, but also necessarily active. Toland nevertheless stopped short of adopting a full-blown Leibnizian metaphysic, such as one involving the rehabilitated substantial forms of LeibnizÕs ÒNew SystemÓ, Ò primitive forces , which contain É an original activity Ó (AG 139). 3\n\nIn this paper I argue for two main theses about this exchange and its consequences for our wider understanding. The first is that, despite many claims that Toland was at the time of Letters to Serena a Spinozist, we can make better sense of him as a sort of Hobbesian\n\n1 [Acknowledgements.

I give references to this using the abbreviation ÔLTSÕ followed by letter and section numbers.\n\n3 I use various abbreviations for editions and translation of LeibnizÕs work: ÔAÕ for the Academy edition of LeibnizÕs SŠmtliche Schriften und Briefe ; ÔAGÕ for Ariew and GarberÕs Philosophical Essays collection (Indianapolis: Hackett, 1989); ÔGPÕ for GerhardtÕs Die philosophischen Schriften von Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz ; ÔKSÕ for the Correspondence de Leibniz avec la princesse Žlectrice Sophie de Brunswick-Lunebourg , edited by Onno Klopp (Hannover: Klindworth, 1874), a three volume edition of the Leibniz-Sophie correspondence that corresponds to volumes 7-9 of KloppÕs larger edition of LeibnizÕs correspondence; ÔLÕ for LoemkerÕs Philosophical Papers and Letters collection, second edition (Dordrecht: Kluwer, 1989); and ÔWFNSÕ for Woolhouse and FrancksÕs LeibnizÕs ÔNew SystemÕ and Associated Contemporary Texts (Oxford: Clarendon, 1997).\n\nmaterialist. Here one might helpfully contrast the ways in which Hobbesian materialists responded to LeibnizÕs criticisms of their materialism. Hobbes didnÕt have a chance to respond himself.  Damaris Masham had only a short correspondence with Leibniz, and 4 seemed to persist in her view.  Toland, however, adapted his materialism in a way that 5 attempted to respond to Leibniz, but without changing the fundamental character of his approach.\n\nThe second main point concerns reasons for materialism, and in particular a story Locke tells in the Essay about materialistsÕ motives. Locke sees materialists as motivated by the alleged inconceivability of an immaterial mind. LockeÕs comments suggest an interesting historical narrative about the reasons of early modern materialists. And if we look at the arguments of Hobbes and Toland, we see that they both used arguments involving conceivability considerations to support their materialism, but neither did so in anything like the straightforward way that Locke suggests. Hobbes is concerned more with criticizing dualistsÕ misuses of conceivability arguments than with promoting his own. Toland defends his materialism by arguing that matter is active, and argues that matter is active by using a conceivability argument. But this is not the crude conceivability argument that Locke suggests motivates materialists. Thinking about the Letters to Serena thus suggests that there is a useful story we might tell about the use of conceivability considerations in support of early modern materialism, but it is not the simple story that Locke tells. 6\n\nThis paper is divided into four main sections. The first introduces the Leibniz-Toland exchanges of 1702-4. The second looks in particular at the fourth and fifth of TolandÕs\n\n4 Leibniz did write two letters to Hobbes. However, itÕs not clear that Hobbes received them. Indeed, the second letter begins as if Hobbes had never been aware of the first, and itÕs not known whether the second was ever sent. Moreover, they focus on political philosophy and on physics, rather than the truth or otherwise of materialism. See Thomas Hobbes, The Correspondence of Thomas Hobbes , edited by Noel Malcolm (Oxford: Clarendon, 1994), 713-22 and 731-5.\n\n5 [Removed for review]\n\n6 These two theses, taken together, give us a picture of both what Toland was arguing for and how he was arguing for it. They also suggest important broader claims: negatively, a certain question about just how widespread Spinozism was as a philosophical phenomenon, and positively, an interesting narrative about motives and reasons for materialism in early modern philosophy. Neither of these broader claims can be fully defended here. But they can be motivated, and do suggest a further value to looking at Toland, beyond those of understanding his work and his exchanges with Leibniz.\n\nLetters to Serena . The third tackles the issue of TolandÕs alleged Spinozism, and how that relates to a materialism that Leibniz describes as Hobbesian. And the fourth looks at the argument of the fifth letter in the broader context of the use of conceivability considerations in arguing for materialism in the early modern period.\n\n## 1. LeibnizÕs exchanges with Toland\n\nLeibnizÕs interactions with Toland extended over several years. Leibniz had become aware of Toland while reading LockeÕs response to Stillingfleet, in which Locke is at pains to distinguish his view from TolandÕs.  Leibniz later wrote comments on TolandÕs 7 Christianity not Mysterious , the relevant text of TolandÕs.  The discussions on which I focus in this paper 8 then took place in 1702 and 1704. And Leibniz and Toland continued to interact, albeit more sporadically, for several more years. 9\n\nToland traveled to  the court in Berlin, where Sophie Charlotte was queen, and to the court in Hanover, home of the Electress Sophie. 10 While around, Toland managed to provoke, debate, and generally arouse negative opinion. At one point he argued that there were no cannibals in North America Ð that those stories had just been made up by the Spanish to cover their cruelty to the inhabitants. Leibniz objected, giving some reasons for believing there to be cannibals. Sophie, on hearing of TolandÕs view, suggested that the cannibals might at least be useful friends for Toland to have: ÒIÕm not surprised that Toland takes the cannibalsÕ side, because they might one day be his protectors Ð for he, unfortunate man, has all of Christianity against himÓ (KS 2.376).\n\nOne of the debates that Toland provoked was his extended exchange with Leibniz about materialism and related issues. This exchange falls into three reasonably distinct parts.\n\n7 See chapter 10 of M.R. Antognazza, Leibniz on the Trinity and the Incarnation (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2007).\n\n8 Leibniz, ÒAnnotatiunculae subitaneae ad librum de Christianismo Mysteriis carente:\n\nConscriptae 8 Augusti 1701Ó, in A Collection of Several Pieces of Mr John Toland (London, 1726). The text is on pages 60-76 of the appendices in volume 2.\n\n9 Thus, for instance, Toland, A Collection (2.400-2) contains a letter written by Leibniz to Toland from Hannover dated 1 March 1710. And as late as 1716 Leibniz commented on TolandÕs comments on one of LeibnizÕs replies to Bayle (AG 225-30).\n\n10 Toland wrote a book about his travels, An Account of the Courts of Prussia and Hannover (London, 1714).\n\n## 1.1 Sophie Charlotte letters\n\nThe first part is in an exchange of letters arranged by Sophie Charlotte. In Berlin, Toland presented his materialist views to Sophie Charlotte. She then arranged a discussion between Toland and Leibniz about the issue, conducted by letters that she sent back and forth. The exchange seems to have begun with a letter from Toland, which no longer exists. Leibniz describes his first letter as a response to Òthe letter that was sent some time ago from Paris to Osnabruck, which I recently read, at your command, in HannoverÓ (AG 186). Toland then wrote a further letter in response to LeibnizÕs, and Leibniz responded to that one too. 11\n\nMost of LeibnizÕs first letter is devoted to discussing the extent to which thought depends on the senses. The discussion is complex. But Leibniz sums up his position as follows.\n\nYet I agree that, in the present state, the external senses are necessary for our thinking, and that if we did not have any, we would not think. But that which is necessary for something does not, for all that, constitute its essence. Air is necessary for our life, but our life is something other than air. The senses provide us material for reasoning, and we never have thoughts so abstract that something from the senses is not intermixed with them; but reasoning requires something else besides that which is sensible (AG 191).\n\nLeibniz turns then to a second question, Òwhether there are immaterial substances Ó (L 551). He thinks there are such things. Perhaps they are always united to bodies, but that wouldnÕt be to give up on immaterial substances. Going further, Leibniz does argue that there is a substance separate from matter. But this is God, not some finite created substance. In addition, Leibniz argues Ð or rather says Ð that there can be no mechanical explanation of perception.\n\nToland responded to Leibniz in a letter of his own to Sophie Charlotte. TolandÕs main strategy is to agree with much of what Leibniz says, but deny that this shows Òthat there is something in our thoughts that does not come from our sensesÓ (GP 5.509). Toland also draws attention to ways in which the development of thought parallels the development of\n\n11 LeibnizÕs first letter, on what is independent of sense and of matter, is printed at GP 6.499508, and translated at L 547-553, and at AG 186-92. TolandÕs letter is at GP 6.508-14, and LeibnizÕs response at 6.514-9.\n\nthe body, and argues that Ò we have room to conclude from this common progress of the soul and the body that the soul is what it is, thinks what it thinks, and does what it does because of the body and corporeal things Ó (GP 5.511).\n\nLeibnizÕs response to that came in another letter to Sophie Charlotte. In large part Leibniz spells out material thatÕs familiar from the ÒNew SystemÓ. He also notes that ÒI see nowhere where he [Toland] directly attacks the immateriality of the soulÓ (GP 5.517), which seems right. In this exchange, at least as it survives, Toland focuses solely on the dependence of thought on the senses, and says nothing directly about materialism. Perhaps both Leibniz and Toland are assuming some close connection between TolandÕs sort of empiricism and materialism, but that too is unstated.\n\n## 1.2 Bayle letters\n\nThe second part of the 1702 exchange between Leibniz and Toland about materialism involved discussions between them and Pierre Bayle. In Note C of the entry ÒDicaearchusÓ in his Dictionary , Bayle argues against the view Òthat the soul is not distinct from the bodyÓ. 12 Bayle argues that, if you say that bodies have the power of thought, you have to say they always have this. Thus you must say Òeither that the substance that thinks is distinct from the body, or that all bodies are substances that thinkÓ (Bayle 1991, 65). Toland wrote to Bayle, criticizing this argument. 13\n\nTolandÕs objection is reported by Bayle at the beginning of his response to Toland in Note L. TolandÕs idea is that one can say that some but not all bodies think, if one says that thought arises from the Òmechanical disposition of several parts of matterÓ (Bayle 1991, 68). That is, matter doesnÕt think just because itÕs matter, but because itÕs matter with its parts put together in the right way. And this view, Toland argues, hasnÕt really been engaged by Bayle. Faced with this mechanistic version of the view that matter can think, Bayle responds that it\n\n12 Pierre Bayle, Historical and Critical Dictionary: Selections , edited and translated by Richard H. Popkin (Indianapolis: Hackett, 1991), 65. For discussion of some of the arguments against materialism in ÒDicaearchusÓ, see Todd Ryan, ÒBayleÕs Critique of Lockean SuperadditionÓ, Canadian Journal of Philosophy 36 (2006) 511-34.\n\n13 TolandÕs letter to Bayle seems not to exist. Thus Elisabeth Labrousse, in discussing this exchange, refers only to LeibnizÕs letter to Bayle. She also confirms the thought that itÕs TolandÕs letter to which Bayle is responding in note L to ÒDichaearchusÓ. Elisabeth Labrousse, Pierre Bayle (Paris: Alin Michel, 1996, first published 1994), 238n.\n\ndoes not really change the situation. Rearranging mechanical parts, argues Bayle, cannot produce thought. What it can do is change the amount of motion in the system. But it could not produce thought, Òif each organ before being put in its place was not actually endowed with the ability to thinkÓ (Bayle 1991, 70).\n\nLeibnizÕs involvement in this exchange consists in a letter to Bayle. Fundamentally, Leibniz agreed with Bayle. For he thought that Òwhen it is appropriately organized, matter can become suitable for allowing clear thoughts, but not for giving rise to thoughts where there were noneÓ (WFNS 131). In an earlier draft of the letter, Leibniz added a further argument. 14 This is a version of his famous mill argument (which, when it occurs in its most famous location in the ÔMonadologyÕ, is in a section after one that mentions Bayle). 15\n\n## 1.3 Letters to Serena\n\nThe third part of the exchange centers on TolandÕs Letters to Serena , which was published in 1704. This book, which consists of a preface and five letters, is closely connected to the 1702 debates. The first three letters, on ÒThe Origin and Force of PrejudicesÓ, ÒThe History of the SoulÕs Immortality among the HeathensÓ, and ÒThe Origin of Idolatry, and Reasons of HeathenismÓ, are all addressed to the woman who Toland calls, in his title and preface, Serena. Serena is usually and plausibly thought to be Queen Sophie Charlotte. These may well be versions of work that Toland wrote for Sophie Charlotte when in Berlin in 1702.\n\nThe preface (which itself is a letter), and the fourth and fifth letters, each appear to be addressed to a different man. The fourth letter, which presents arguments against Spinoza, is addressed to an anonymous ÒGentleman in HollandÓ. The fifth letter argues that matter is necessarily active. Its early passages make clear that it was addressed to someone other than the addressee of the fourth letter, whoÕs referred to as Òour worthy FriendÓ (LTS 5.1, 164). The unnamed addressee of this fifth letter may well have been Jakob Heinrich von\n\n14 For the evidence that this is an earlier version, see WFNS 126, n130.\n\n15 Toland also appears to have written a set of ÒCritical RemarksÓ on LeibnizÕs system, which are dated 1703 but were not published until 1716. These respond to part of LeibnizÕs debate with Bayle (specifically, LeibnizÕs response to the comments Bayle made in the second edition of the Dictionary ). R.S. Woolhouse, ÒJohn Toland and ÔRemarques Critiques sur le SystGLYPH&lt;144&gt;me de Monsr. Leibnitz de lÕHarmonie prŽŽtablieÕÓ, Leibniz Society Review 8 (1998), 80-7 argues convincingly for TolandÕs authorship of the remarks. Leibniz responded to these remarks in 1716 (AG 225-30).\n\nFlemming, who probably met Toland in Berlin in 1702. 16 The preface is titled as Òa Letter to a Gentleman in London, sent together with the following DissertationsÓ. The addressee of this letter may well have been Pierre Desmaizeaux. 17\n\nThe fourth and fifth letters connect closely to the 1702 debates about materialism. Leibniz saw proofs of much of the relevant text: the end of the third letter, the fourth, and the start of the fifth (LTS 5.1-16). He commented on these passages in a letter. 18 Leibniz saw Toland as having taken a step in the right direction. Toland was right in particular, Leibniz thought, to distinguish local motion from motive force, for only by doing so can one avoid introducing the problematic miracles of occasionalism. Nevertheless, Leibniz disagreed with TolandÕs view of matter as necessarily active, if only because Leibniz wanted to distinguish matter from body ( corps ) and corporeal substance ( substance corporelle ). This was perhaps the central point of disagreement between Leibniz and Toland. In broad terms, it was that Toland, though he had adopted the Leibnizian notion of widespread and underlying activity, was far from having adopted the full Leibnizian metaphysical scheme. 19\n\n## 2. TolandÕs position in the fourth and fifth Letters to Serena\n\n## 2.1 TolandÕs materialism\n\nLeibniz clearly thought that Toland was a materialist, thinking first that he was an atomist materialist, then that he was a plenist materialist like Hobbes. These descriptions of TolandÕs view occur in LeibnizÕs 1702 reports to Sophie of what Toland had said to Sophie Charlotte.\n\n16 See S. Brown, ÒTwo Papers by John Toland: His ÔRemarques Critiques sur le SystGLYPH&lt;144&gt;me de M. LeibnitzÉÕ and the last of his Letters to Serena Ó, Rivista I Castelli di Yale 4 (1999), 5579. Brown assembles (58-9) the case for Flemming being TolandÕs correspondent.\n\n17 For the case that the addressee is Desmaizeaux, see Woolhouse (1998, 83).\n\n18 This letter is published in G. Tognon, ÒLeibniz et Toland: Una letter inŽdite ˆ propos de Letters to Serena Ó in Leibniz: Werk und Wirkung. IV. Internationaler Leibniz-Kongress (Hannover: G.W. Leibniz-Gesellschaft, 1983) 784-93. It is also reprinted in G. Tognon, ÒLeibniz, Toland, et Spinoza: Una letter inŽdite ˆ propos de Letters to Serena Ó, Bulletin de lÕassociation des amis de Spinoza 12 (1984) 2-11. I cite the 1983 publication.\n\n19 Stuart Brown argues that Leibniz himself reacted to Toland, particularly by becoming more clearly opposed to belief in separated souls. Stuart Brown, ÒThe Leibniz-Toland Debates on Materialism and the Soul at the Court of the Queen of PrussiaÓ, in H. Poser (ed.), Nihil Sine Ratione: Mensch, Natur, und Technik im Wirken von G. W. Leibniz, VII. Internationaler Leibniz-Kongress (Berlin: G.W. Leibniz Gesellschaft, 2002), 1.147-54, in particular 1.151-4.\n\nThe first relevant letter here is one written by Leibniz to Sophie on 9 September 1702.\n\nMr Toland [É] read a discourse to the Queen about the soul, which depended on, roughly, LucretiusÕs view, that is on the concurrence [ concours ] of corpuscles. But Toland doesnÕt say why matter has motion and order, nor why there is sense in the world (KS 2.362).\n\nIn responding to Leibniz four days later, Sophie agreed that Toland needed to explain those things indicated by Leibniz (KS 2.363-4). That is, Leibniz and Sophie agree that Toland needs to say why thereÕs motion and order in matter, and why there is sense in the world. So far, they think, his materialism fails to do that. By the time of another letter to Sophie, later in September, Leibniz had changed his characterization of TolandÕs view a little.\n\nThe view is HobbesÕs view that thereÕs nothing in nature but shapes and movements. This was also the view of Epicurus and Lucretius, except that they admitted the vacuum and atoms or hard particles, but Hobbes thought that everything is full and fluid, which is also my view. But I think that we ought to look for the origin of action, perception, and order underneath matter, that is, underneath that which is purely passive and indifferent to movement (KS 2.364).\n\nLeibniz had come to think of Toland as a Hobbesian rather than a Lucretian materialist Ð that is, as a materialist believer in a plenum rather than a materialist believer in atoms in the void.\n\nHowever, in the surviving texts of the three discussions described above (the one conducted via Sophie Charlotte, the one involving Bayle, and the one centred on Letters to Serena ) TolandÕs position is somewhat elusive. In the first set of discussions, Toland focuses on the dependence of thought on the body and senses. Nothing he says seems incompatible with materialism, but nothing he says really asserts it either. Something similar goes on in the discussions involving Bayle. Again we see Leibniz saying that Toland is a materialist, but not Toland saying it himself.  Bayle is careful indeed to note that Toland is not arguing for the materialist position, just objecting to the argument against it that Bayle had given. 20 The\n\n20 ÒHe only wanted to show that I was wrong in accusing Dichaearchus of inconsistency, and that the system does not fall part just because this philosopher has not admitted sensation and\n\nsame sort of thing seems to be true about the discussion of Letters to Serena : Toland approaches materialism, but doesnÕt state it.\n\nThere was a significant change in TolandÕs view of the material world during this period. In the fourth and fifth Letters to Serena Toland thought of matter as necessarily active, but there is no sign of that view in the earlier exchanges. 21 In the Letters to Serena Toland wanted to change our picture of matter. And we may well speculate that he wanted to do that in order to make materialism more appealing. But the statements of and arguments for materialism that one would expect are absent.\n\nIt is nevertheless plausible that Toland was a materialist throughout this period, at least about the natural world. We have LeibnizÕs reports. And though Toland does not come out and assert materialism, he does not deny it, and his various arguments (for the dependence of the mind on the senses, against BayleÕs objections to thinking matter, and even for active matter) are compatible with a plenist materialist picture of the world. If you began with a Hobbesian conviction that the natural world contains only extended material things, added a Lockean conviction that all matter is solid, and then the distinctive view that matter is necessarily active, you would end up, it seems, with more or less TolandÕs view in Letters to Serena . Without the addition of the view that matter is active Ð an addition that comes only in Letters to Serena Ð we have, as Leibniz says, something very much like HobbesÕs materialism.\n\n## 2.2 Active matter\n\nThe main view advocated in letter five, which Toland expresses in various ways, is that matter is necessarily active. Toland believes that things can have necessary or essential features: features they always have, and which are part of their definition. Thus he says that Ò Matter is necessarily active as well as extended Ó (LTS 5.1, 164), that Ò Activity ought to enter into the Definition of Matter, [and] it ought likewise to express the Essence thereof Ó (LTS 5.2, 165), and speaks of Òmatter being definÕd active as well as extended (to which you may add Solidity, with the incomparable Mr. LOCK)Ó (LTS 5.2, 166).\n\nimperishable life to be in bodies that have once been aliveÓ (Bayle 1991, 69).\n\n21 Brown (2002, 149) describes TolandÕs view in the 1702 discussions as seeming to be Òa kind of materialistic LockeanismÓ.\n\nIn talking about the activity of matter, Toland often talks about local motion, change of place. Indeed, he emphasizes the extent to which we can observe motion throughout the world, at all scales and places (LTS 15-6, 186-92). One might suspect, reading this, that Toland thinks that matter is always in motion. But Toland also insists on a distinction between motion and an underlying activity, Òbetween the internal Energy, Autokinesy, or essential Action of all Matter, without which it couÕd be capable of no particular Alteration or Division; and the external local Motion or Changes of Place, which are but the various Modifications of the essential Action as their SubjectÓ (LTS 5.17, 193-4). 22 ItÕs not altogether clear just what this underlying activity or energy is, and how it relates to motion. Particular motions of an object must be closely related both to the motions of some other object, their cause, and to the internal essential activity of the object itself. It is clear however that TolandÕs considered view is that this underlying activity is whatÕs necessarily present, not the local motion itself.\n\nThe view that matter is necessarily active, curious though it may seem, does have various precedents in early modern philosophy.\n\nLeibnizÕs own views serve as some sort of precedent. Consider the ÒNew SystemÓ, with its talk of rehabilitated substantial forms called Ò primitive forces , which contain É an original activity Ó (AG 139). Those expressions of LeibnizÕs do suggest that underlying the material world is force, something active Ð which is roughly TolandÕs view. Consider also LeibnizÕs various anti-Cartesian suggestions (most famously perhaps in the ÔDiscourse on MetaphysicsÕ) that we need to think of the world as containing not just extension but also force, which is something metaphysical. The use of ÔmetaphysicalÕ suggests the force is on a different level than the extension, in a way TolandÕs view doesnÕt acknowledge. But one could nevertheless see Leibniz, in very rough outline, as taking the Cartesian extended world, or the Hobbesian world of matter in motion, and adding underlying active force to it. And one could see Toland as doing, at that level of abstraction, pretty much the same thing.\n\n22 ÔAutokinesyÕ is a word used by Cudworth in his True Intellectual System (159, 668), and I presume that Toland took the word from there. (The OED records no earlier, indeed no other, uses than CudworthÕs, though Henry More had used ÔautokineticalÕ in his 1647 Philosophicall Poems .) ÔAutokinesyÕ appears to have been constructed by Cudworth from Greek. ÔAutokinesisÕ, perhaps the most obvious Greek word for Cudworth to have used as a source, is a somewhat unusual word, in a way that suggests Cudworth may have taken it from Plotinus.\n\nLeibniz is not the only one to have a view somewhat resembling TolandÕs. One might see SpinozaÕs view of extension (in particular, his view that motion and rest is the infinite immediate mode of extension) as another. Thus Bennett, for instance, talks of how Spinoza Òthinks of the world as somehow self-moving, perhaps like an animalÓ. 23 I discuss the relation of this view to TolandÕs in section 3.1 below.\n\nLooking beyond these names that are often associated with Toland, we find other precedents for the belief in the activity of matter. Indeed Hobbes at one time (the 1660s) believed that God was an extended corporeal thing, but one with powers unlike most corporeal things. 24 God, said Hobbes, Òis corporeal and infiniteÓ, Òa most pure, and most simple corporeal spiritÓ. 25 Though Hobbes shied away from saying definitely how this spirit works on other corporeal things, the one analogy he did offer (involving the mixing of liquids) suggests that it is an active material thing. Thus he said that Ò[i]f then such gross bodies have so great activity, what shall we think of spirits, whose kinds be as many as there be kinds of liquor, and activity greater? Can it then be doubted, but that God, who is an infinitely fine Spirit, and withal intelligent, can make and change all species and kinds of body as he pleaseth?Ó (EW 4.309-10).\n\nGassendi provides a further example. For he seems to have believed that atoms possess a vis motrix , Òthe natural and internal faculty or force by which atoms move and goÓ. 26 For Gassendi, Òatoms are mobile and active because of a force of moving and acting that God gave them in his creation of themÓ. 27 Though Gassendi here is talking about atoms rather than larger bodies, again we have the suggestion, from another rather prominent modern philosopher, that material things do not have purely passive natures.\n\nOne might also suggest that the ÒhylozoicÓ or ÒStratonicÓ atheism discussed by Cudworth in his True Intellectual System is close to TolandÕs view. Ò Hylozoism Ó says\n\n23 Jonathan Bennett, A Study of SpinozaÕs Ethics (Indianapolis: Hackett, 1984), 107. I should note that Bennett goes on to say that Ò[a]lthough he [Spinoza] attached importance to this, I canÕt make it yield interesting philosophyÓ.\n\n24 [Removed for review]\n\n25 Thomas Hobbes, The English Works of Thomas Hobbes , edited by W. Molesworth (London: John Bohn, 1839Ð40) 4.306.\n\n26 Gassendi, Syntagma , at Opera 1.273a, quoting the translation of Antonia LoLordo, Pierre Gassendi and the Birth of Early Modern Philosophy (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007) 140.\n\n27 Gassendi, Syntagma , at Opera 1.280a, quoting the translation of LoLordo (2007, 143).\n\nCudworth Òmakes all Body, as such É to have Life Essentially belonging to it (Natural Perception, and Appetite), though without any Animal Sense or Reflexive Knowledge Ó (TIS 105). 28 However, though that has certain similarities to TolandÕs active matter view, it is also importantly different, attributing more to matter than Toland does. This is most clearly shown by the fact that Toland actually attacks this view, where he criticizes philosophers who have Òtaught that all Matter is animatedÓ (LTS 5.23, 209). Like Cudworth, Toland calls this view hylozoic, and associates it with with Strato. 29 Indeed, Toland goes on in this section to criticize CudworthÕs own view that the world contains plastic natures, suggesting that CudworthÕs view differs from hylozoism Òonly about wordsÓ (LTS 5.23, 211). 30\n\nNevertheless, though we might think that the standard early modern view was that matter was passive, and thus that Toland had a strange and idiosyncratic conception of it, there are in fact several precedents for his view. None of them are exactly his view, and none of this is to say that his view wasnÕt still somewhat out of the ordinary. But it was not just the weird opinion of one isolated man either.\n\n## 2.3 Conceivability argument\n\nTolandÕs central argument for the active matter view in the fifth letter is a conceivability argument. Toland argues that Ò Matter cannot as much as be conceivÕd without an Action of its own, or under some Effect of such an Action Ó (LTS 5.4, 168). He moves pretty quickly from this to the conclusion that matter is necessarily active. I suggest that the following structure captures what Toland is saying.\n\n- 1. Ò Matter cannot as much as be conceivÕd without an Action of its own, or under some Effect of such an Action Ó (LTS 5.4, 168).\n- 2. An implicit premise about the sort of conceivability used above being a good guide to possibility.\n\n28 Ralph Cudworth, The True Intellectual System of the Universe (London: Richard Royston, 1678), facsimile reproduction (Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt: Friedrich Frommann Verlag (GŸnther Holzboog), 1964).\n\n29 Thus I disagree with the suggestion of Tognon (1983, 785) that LTS 5.23 is an attack on Leibniz.\n\n30 This discussion of CudworthÕs does suggest that one might also look for ancient precedents for TolandÕs claims. That would take me too far from the central topic here. But see LoLordo (2007, 142-3) on Gassendi on the motion of ancient atoms.\n\n## 3. ÒMatter is necessarily activeÓ (LTS 5.1, 164).\n\nToland supports his first premise by working through a series of examples of matterÕs features, and arguing that each of them is or is the result of some action, in particular some motion. One might think that this is a terribly unpromising strategy. Surely, you might suggest, one can conceive of an object at rest as easily as an object in motion. However, Toland argues, thereÕs a wide variety of qualities that we conceive of objects as having which are so tightly tied to motion that we cannot conceive of the object having the quality without conceiving of the object as having motion. Thus Toland says, for instance, that Òmatter without Action É must be something deprivÕd É of all Sensible Qualities É since all these depend immediately on MotionÓ (LTS 5.4, 168). So to conceive of an object as green, for instance, is to conceive of it as a thing possessing motion, because motions (say, the motions of light and the motions of parts on the surface, and indeed the motions that created the texture of the surface) are responsible for the objectÕs being green. The same story is told about heat, taste, etc, and indeed about divisibility (because division is done by motion).\n\nNote two things about this argument. First, note that Toland is relying on a strong sort of conceivability, which involves a good deal of understanding, in saying that we cannot conceive of inactive matter. Presumably he thinks that the weaker sense, in which one can conceive of inactive matter, is not a real guide to possibility. Second, note that we have to get from inconceivability without local motion to the essential presence, not of local motion, but of the underlying activity. Some of TolandÕs language suggests that he thinks matter is inconceivable without the underlying activity, but then his examples are of motions, and itÕs not even really clear how to conceive of the underlying activity.\n\nI will not here explore these criticisms in depth, or look much at ways in which one might defend the argument. But note that, in responding to the first criticism, one might begin by arguing that weaker sorts of conceivability appear to be poor guides to possibility. Thus I might initially think I can conceive of an ant the size of an adult human, and thus think it to be possible. I might draw a picture of an enormous ant to support my claim. But then, thinking more about ants, I might well conclude that no ant could really be that size, as it would collapse under its own weight. ItÕs not obvious that such a thing is possible after all. This narrower sense of possibility, in which giant ants are impossible, requires a stronger sort of conceivability as a guide to it Ð more or less the sort of conceivability that Toland relies\n\non. In responding to the second criticism, one might try to separate things more strictly than Toland tends to Ð have first a argument that matter is necessarily in local motion, then second an argument that that local motion must be supported by an inner activity.\n\n## 3. TolandÕs alleged Spinozism\n\n## 3.1 IsraelÕs interpretation\n\nSo far I have just been referring to Toland as a materialist. Several authors have, however, argued that Toland is in Letters to Serena advocating a sort of Spinozism, despite his apparent objection to Spinoza in the fourth letter. Thus Jonathan Israel says that Òall Toland is doing in his discussion of motion in matter is restating SpinozaÕs thesis that motion is inherent in matter while pretending to criticize him for not expounding that very positionÓ. 31 Spinoza says that motion and rest is the infinite immediate mode of extension. 32 While that latter position is not obviously exactly the same as TolandÕs view that matter is necessarily active, it is close enough that this interpretation needs to be taken seriously. 33\n\nDiscussion of this interpretation does need some account of what counts as Spinozism, as opposed to materialism, atheism, or radicalism, all of which are associated with Spinoza, but presumably none of which is enough in itself to make a view count as Spinozism. IÕll take it, for working purposes, that just some closer connection is required, leaving it open just what that is. In one case it might be having SpinozaÕs one substance view. In another it might be being a materialist because of oneÕs reading of Spinoza. There need not really be a fixed set of conditions.\n\n31 Jonathan Israel, Enlightenment Contested (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), 184. Israel is not the only person to think of Hobbes as a Spinozist. Ann Thomson, ÒInformal NetworksÓ, in Knud Haakonssen (ed.) The Cambridge History of Eighteenth-Century Philosophy (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006), 121-36, says that TolandÕs Letters to Serena Òpresent SpinozaÕs ideas and claim to criticize them by insisting that motion is essential to matterÓ (130). Rosalie Colie, ÒHobbes and the Early English DeistsÓ, Journal of the History of Ideas 20 (1959), 23-46 says that Toland was a ÒSpinozist in many of his viewsÓ (45) and seems to agree with TolandÕs contemporary critic William Wotton that TolandÕs criticism of Spinoza in the fourth letter, though genuine, is just a means to the end of a revised and improved Spinozism.\n\n32 Spinoza, The Letters , trans. Samuel Shirley (Indianapolis: Hackett, 1995), Ep64. 33 John Yolton, meanwhile, suggests that TolandÕs active matter view might Òbe an indication of some awareness on his part of the doctrine of forces in NewtonÕs accountÓ. John Yolton, Thinking Matter (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1984), 101.\n\nSome aspects of Letters to Serena , and of closely associated texts, do lend support to the Spinozist reading, but the evidence is far from overwhelming. 34\n\n- 1. Consider the central view that matter is necessarily active, which Israel points to. This is plausibly a view of SpinozaÕs, though various objections made at the time suggest that not everyone saw it as SpinozaÕs view (see point 4 below). The view that matter is active is indeed TolandÕs view in Letters to Serena . But as weÕve seen, this has precedents other than the Spinozistic one. So this observation alone is not enough to lead us to conclude that Toland is a Spinozist.\n\nNow one might suggest that itÕs a combination of views including the active matter one that indicate TolandÕs Spinozism. If Toland is an atheist materialist who believes in active matter, one might well say, the connection is rather closer. Then the world, in TolandÕs view, contains just one thing (the matter), which is active. And thatÕs not so far from SpinozaÕs one substance view. However, itÕs not so clear Toland is an atheist. For towards the end of the fifth letter he states his belief in GodÕs existence, and defends his active matter view against the objection that it implies the non-existence of God (LTS 5.30). Of course, this could be dissimulation too. But we need some evidence for that, aside from the observation that it must be the case if the claim that Toland was a Spinozist is to be maintained. 35\n\n- 2. Think about the way that letters four and five fit together. TolandÕs overall message might be summarized as ÔSpinoza cannot explain the presence of motion in the world, but I canÕ. ThatÕs a somewhat odd thing to say unless you look seriously at other views, such as views which invoke a God distinct from the world, or you hold some variant of SpinozaÕs\n\n34 I should emphasize here that IÕm just talking about the text and views of Letters to Serena (and to a lesser extent the 1702 exchanges with Leibniz). ItÕs another question what to make of some of TolandÕs later views, in such works as his Pantheisticon .\n\n35 Brown (1999, 66) points to some passages from TolandÕs 1703 ÒCritical RemarksÓ that seem to suggest materialism. But the passages donÕt terribly clearly say that there is no God Ð they might well just be proposing materialism about the natural world, which is perfectly compatible with whatÕs said in Letters to Serena . Brown (1999, 71) also suggests that LeibnizÕs 1702 paper on an universal spirit (L 554-60) provides evidence that Toland was a pantheist at this point. But the relevance of that paper to LeibnizÕs thought about Toland is highly questionable, Toland not appearing to be a believer in a soul of the world. Note too that Leibniz seems not to think Ð or at least to say Ð that Toland is a Spinozist. And goodness knows Leibniz was willing to say negative things about Toland.\n\nview yourself. Toland doesnÕt do the former, suggesting he was in fact presupposing a sort of one-substance materialism: not exactly SpinozaÕs view, but something recognizably like it. However, thereÕs another way to understand the relationship between the two letters. In a letter, which later became letter four, Toland said ÔI think Spinoza is wrong about this topicÕ. Then Flemming asked what Toland himself thought about the same topic. And in response, in what became letter five, Toland told him. If, as seems most likely, these letters really did start out as letters Ð their presentation as letters is not just a literary device Ð this is at least as plausible a story about the connection of the two letters as the one above.\n\n3. Consider the way in which Toland distinguishes Òbetween the internal Energy, Autokinesy, or essential Action of all Matter, without which it couÕd be capable of no particular Alteration or Division; and the external local Motion or Changes of Place, which are but the various Modifications of the essential Action as their SubjectÓ (LTS 5.17, 193-4). That language, in particular the talk of modifications, suggests Toland is taking the option which he notes Spinoza doesnÕt take, saying that motion is an attribute of the one substance. However, TolandÕs descriptions of the world do not in general suggest the adoption of the substance-attribute-mode framework that Spinoza adapts from Descartes. So TolandÕs active matter view is not really the sort of modified Spinozism that Toland suggests Spinoza might have held.\n\nSpinoza himself does not take over that entire framework from Descartes. Whatever other changes one might think he makes, we can at least agree that Spinoza thinks that a substance can have more than one attribute, contrary to DescartesÕs view that a substance has exactly one principal attribute. But the basic language, and something of the picture of the metaphysical structure of substances, is the same. Toland does not share this picture. He does think that matter has some essential features, features it always has to some degree or another. But he does not think that all of matterÕs other features are modes of these essential features. A bookÕs being green is for Toland the result of the extension, solidity, and motion of its parts. But none of those three essential features is for him an attribute of which being green is a mode.\n\nThat there are echoes of Cartesian metaphysical language such as this is unsurprising, just given the time in which Toland was writing, and his wide range of influences. But the systematic approach appears to be absent. Moreover, even if it were present, that would be a\n\nrather weak connection to Spinoza. Certainly, for instance, one could adopt that framework and still believe in the existence of a God distinct from the world, the existence of multiple substances in the world, and even that thinking substances are distinct from extended substances. On its own, itÕs just not a good indicator of adherence to Spinozism. And even when combined with some sort of materialism, it still leaves the question of TolandÕs Spinozism open.\n\n- 4. A further thing that might shed some light on TolandÕs alleged Spinozism is his criticism of Spinoza. TolandÕs main idea is that Spinoza cannot explain why there is motion in the world.  Toland explicitly connects this criticism to one that Tschirnhaus made in letters to Spinoza, a criticism that Spinoza was somewhat elusive in answering. That connection to TschirnhausÕs criticisms is one reason to think that Toland was no Spinozist in Letters to Serena . Tschirnhaus was not supporting Spinoza by making this criticism Ð how is Toland supposed to be? Well, Toland might be repeating TschirnhausÕs criticism, but all the while thinking thereÕs a Spinozistic answer (which he Toland has). But some more detailed investigation of this issue is necessary.\n\nToland knew Tschirnhaus as the author of various letters in SpinozaÕs Opera Posthuma . TschirnhausÕs criticisms of Spinoza on motion, to which Toland refers, occur in some of those letters. 36 The issue first arose in two letters of January 1675. Tschirnhaus asked for Òthe true definition of motion, together with its explanationÓ (Ep 59). Spinoza basically refused to answer the question, saying that his views were Ònot yet written out in due orderÓ (Ep 60). The issue came up again in letters of May-July 1676. Tschirnhaus told Spinoza that he was puzzled about Òhow the existence of bodies having motion and figure can be demonstrated a priori, since there is nothing of this kind to be found in Extension, taken in the absolute senseÓ (Ep 80). Here, as indeed in his earlier letters, TschirnhausÕs question came together with a similar question about how Spinozistic extension can explain the variety of bodies in the world. Spinoza responded that the solution lies in having the correct conception of extension. For Òfrom extension as conceived by Descartes, to wit, an inert mass, it is not only difficult, as you say, but quite impossible to demonstrate the\n\n36 TschirnhausÕs letters are Ep 59, 80, and 82, and SpinozaÕs replies Ep 60, 81, and 83. Toland refers in the fourth letter to all of these letters, using the numbering system of the Opera Posthuma , on which they are letters 63, 64, 69, 70, and 71.\n\nexistence of bodies. For matter at rest, as far as in it lies, will continue to be at rest, and will not be set in motion except by a more powerful external causeÓ (Ep 81). The answer must then presumably lie in having a different conception of the nature of extension, though Spinoza did not explicitly say here what that conception is. The matter is pursued a little more in the next two letters, though without the basic situation changing: Spinoza thinks that DescartesÕs conception of extension is wrong, but doesnÕt have a fully written out explanation of how variety and motion of bodies follow from his own conception of extension.\n\nThat lack of an explicit explanation leaves considerable room for interpretive work here. And because this issue is tightly connected to the general issue of how Spinoza thinks attributes relate to infinite and finite modes, how one understands this issue depends very much on how one understands SpinozaÕs overall metaphysical picture. Nevertheless, though the details of SpinozaÕs ultimate positive answer are not obvious, the content of the question Ð namely, how Spinoza can explain the presence of motion in the world Ð is clear. There is a similar question that Spinoza has an answer for, about the cause of any particular motion. That will be some other particular motion. But the question of why there is motion at all in the world, which presumably ought to be ultimately given in terms of the attribute of extension, remains.\n\nWith that background in mind, look now at the main argument of the fourth of TolandÕs Letters to Serena . It runs as follows. 37\n\n- 1. Spinoza must explain why there is motion in the world.\n- 2. There are two possible explanations he might have given: God (actually this itself can be split up, for we have first push explanations and occasionalist ones); matter as an attribute.\n- 3. Spinoza canÕt give the first sort of explanation, for he denies thereÕs a God distinct from the world.\n- 4. But he also denies the second option. So\n- 5. Spinoza cannot explain why there is motion.\n\nToland is fundamentally worried about the same issue as Tschirnhaus, namely how Spinoza can explain why there is motion in the world. Indeed, Toland himself makes the\n\n37 See LTS 4.10-5, in particular 4.12.\n\nconnection between the two objections later in the fourth letter (LTS 4.13, 148-53). Along the way, Toland notes how Òtho his system is at best but an ingenious Philosophical RomanceÓ (LTS 4.13, 152), Descartes did at least answer this question, by invoking God. That may not be a good answer, but Spinoza, Toland argues, doesnÕt have any answer at all. Perhaps, Toland speculates, Spinoza was somehow mislead by his geometric manner of presentation (LTS 4.13, 153). Earlier, Toland suggests that Spinoza dodged TschirnhausÕs objection because Òhe couÕd not bear to part with his System, nor to lose the hopes of heading a new SectÓ (LTS 4.12, 148). Throughout, Toland is clear that he thinks of his and TschirnhausÕs objection as the same objection.\n\nIn his letter about Letters to Serena , Leibniz comments on TschirnhausÕs criticism. 38 Leibniz says that ÒSpinozaÕs correspondent who urged him to say how motion and the variety of things come from extension was an acquaintance of mine, and someone of real merit. This person thought that Spinoza could have said more on the topicÓ (Tognon 1983, 792). That is to say, I suppose, that Tschirnhaus disagreed with TolandÕs suggestion that Spinoza could not answer TschirnhausÕs question. What exactly we should think about LeibnizÕs views here is hard to say Ð a full story would involve some thoughts about what Leibniz in 1704 thought about how his younger self had reacted to the thoughts of Tschirnhaus and Spinoza. 39 But Leibniz does seem at least to be registering some suspicion about whether SpinozaÕs situation is really as bad as Toland makes it out to be.\n\nRoger Woolhouse, while granting that it Òhas always been obscure to his readersÓ how Spinoza thought that motion follows from extended substance, suggests that TolandÕs difficulties might come in part from misunderstanding Spinoza. 40 ÒLike Clarke, Toland gets off on the wrong foot by supposing that SpinozaÕs God is simply the material worldÓ. 41\n\n38 ÒHe [Toland] objects that Spinoza never properly answered the question of his friend (and mine) [Tschirnhaus], who asked Spinoza how extension could give rise to motion in bodies, and [Toland also remarks] that Spinoza caused his friend [Tschirnhaus] to hope for an solution of this problem, but appears never to have kept this promise, for there is no such answer in his posthumous worksÓ (Tognon 1983, 791, my translation).\n\n39 For discussion of that earlier encounter, see for instance Mark Kulstad, ÒLeibniz, Spinoza and Tschirnhaus: Metaphysics ˆ TroisÓ in Olli Koistinen and John Biro (ed.), Spinoza: Metaphysical Themes (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), 221-40.\n\n40 Roger Woolhouse, Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz: the Concept of Substance in SeventeenthCentury Metaphysics (London: Routledge, 1993)\n\n41 Woolhouse 1993, 94.\n\nClarke, seeing similar problems, had found only the explanation of particular motions by other particular motions as an answer, and rightly found that not completely satisfactory. What he (and Toland) had not seen was the story about motion and rest being an immediate infinite mode.\n\nToland indeed doesnÕt talk about the infinite mode. But aside from the issue of whether the understanding of SpinozaÕs one substance as the material world really is wrong, itÕs not so clear that attending to what Spinoza says about the infinite mode helps much in answering TolandÕs objection. Presumably this infinite mode, which Spinoza named in a letter, has some role to play in the explanation of why there is motion in the world. But what that role is is mysterious: perhaps not exactly absent, but certainly puzzling enough to question. Thus, whether or not Toland misunderstood SpinozaÕs overall picture, he does seem to have latched onto a perfectly fair criticism. 42\n\nOf course, a supporter of IsraelÕs reading might say that Toland has only latched on to that criticism as a sort of cover. To attend only to the criticism, they might say, is to miss the overall point, that Toland is in fact arguing in the fifth letter for the very sort of view he criticizes in the fourth. That the fourth letterÕs objection closely resembles TschirnhausÕs just acts as extra camouflage, nothing more.\n\nThis is a judgment of overall intent, and one of a sort thatÕs quite hard to refute. However, we have seen a variety of pieces of evidence both for and against TolandÕs advocating a concealed Spinozism in Letters to Serena , and the evidence is far from overwhelming. There seem indeed to be a variety of notable differences between their views.\n\nThose differences Ð such as TolandÕs not adopting the substance-attribute-mode framework, let alone the details of the system such as the infinite immediate mode of extension, motion and rest Ð might seem, however, to be of a rather narrow and technical sort. Indeed, Israel argues, while stipulating that no one should be called a ÔSpinozistÕ unless they replicate his whole system accurately may make sense as a philosophical exercise it is scarcely relevant in the context of a broad, deep-seated cultural\n\n42 Further complicating the issue about how the explanation might go, thereÕs good reason to think that ÔmotionÕ in the name of the infinite mode doesnÕt mean the same thing as ÔmotionÕ, the name for the state of individual bodies. See Bennett 1984, 106.\n\nphenomenon É [some radical authors] do not, of course, embrace SpinozaÕs system in every respect; often indeed, they only partly understood it. Nevertheless, what these writers stood for was a broad cultural phenomenon called ÔSpinozismÕ (Israel 2006, 184).\n\nCertainly there are different things one might call ÔSpinozismÕ. And indeed it makes little sense, if youÕre interested in the spread of radical ideas somewhat like SpinozaÕs, to look only at those people who believed all that Spinoza believed. On the other hand, one could make too much into Spinozism. Even in the study of broad cultural phenomena, thereÕs some interest in distinguishing, say, Spinozism from Hobbism, to the extent that this is possible. 43\n\nTaking this all into account, we might say that TolandÕs view in Letters to Serena is Spinozist in a weak and broadly applicable sense of that term, but not in a stronger one. Toland is a materialist about the natural world, and if Spinozism broadly speaking is just atheist materialism, Toland is part of the way there. On the other hand, as weÕve seen, itÕs not at all clear that Toland at this point denied the existence of a God distinct from the world. And if we just think of Toland as a materialist, we might better call him a Hobbesian than a Spinozist. Indeed, he seems to have had a broadly Hobbesian view in 1702, and added the active matter view only later as a way of modifying this view to defend the main ideas (nonatomist materialism about the natural world) against LeibnizÕs criticisms (see 4.2 below). 44\n\nThis exercise might seem a rather pointless one, a silly game of putting people in boxes. But discussing this interpretive issue does reveal ways in which TolandÕs materialism is like, and ways in which itÕs not like, the views of Spinoza and Hobbes. More of those connections come out if we think about the ways in which Toland argues for materialism. That also sheds some light on a broader issue, the use of conceivability considerations by early modern materialists in their arguments for materialism.\n\n43 See Noel Malcolm, ÒHobbes and the European Republic of LettersÓ, in Aspects of Hobbes (Oxford: Clarendon, 2002), 457-545, especially 535-7.\n\n44 One might also start to wonder more broadly about just how much Spinozism (as opposed to Hobbism among other things) there was exactly. For discussion of another questionable claim of partially concealed Spinozism, see Paul Lodge, ÒBurchard de Volder: CryptoSpinozist or Disenchanted Cartesian?Ó in Tad Schmaltz (ed.), Receptions of Descartes: Cartesianism and Anti-Cartesianism in Early Modern Europe (London: Routledge, 2005), 128-46.\n\n## 4. Conceivability and Materialism\n\n## 4.1 LockeÕs suggestion\n\nOne puzzle about early modern philosophy is why the few materialist philosophers were materialists. Locke provides a story about this in his Essay , where he sketches two parallel arguments: one for dualism from the inconceivability of materialism, and one for materialism from the inconceivability of dualism. For instance, Locke characterizes an argument on each side in Essay IV.iii.6, describing the arguments as coming from those Òover zealous for, or against the Immateriality of the SoulÓ.\n\nWho, either on the one side, indulging too much their Thoughts altogether in matter, can allow no existence to what is not material; Or who, on the other side, finding not Cogitation within the natural Powers of Matter, examined over and over again, by the utmost intention of Mind, have the confidence to conclude, that Omnipotency it self, cannot give Perception and Thought to a substance, which has the Modification of Solidity. 45\n\nThat gives us arguments for dualism and materialism. Most relevantly, hereÕs the one for materialism.\n\n- 1. An immaterial thinking thing is inconceivable\n- So 2. An immaterial thinking thing is impossible\n\n## So 3. The human mind is material\n\nObviously Locke has his comments to make about these arguments, both of which he rejects. Both arguments seem crude, and open to obvious objections. For one thing, neither shows awareness of an idea that Locke is especially concerned to point out Ð that the limits of conceivability to us might not be the actual limits of possibility.\n\nDespite that, there is something to LockeÕs suggestion that this is a motivation for materialism. Leibniz at least agreed that it was. For he attributed to Hobbes an argument from the inconceivability if immaterial things (given HobbesÕs theory of ideas) to materialism. Moreover, when he corresponded with Damaris Masham (around the time he was discussing materialism with Toland) Leibniz was confronted with someone arguing for\n\n45 John Locke, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding , edited by P.H. Nidditch (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1975) IV.iii.6.\n\nmaterialism in just that way. Masham at one point told Leibniz that Òmy own belief that there is no substance whatever unextended is ... grounded upon this that I have no conception of such a thingÓ. 46\n\nI should emphasize that IÕm not interested in evaluating LockeÕs view precisely as he had it in mind, however exactly he did. For one thing, IÕm interested in what Toland said in 1704, a few years after Locke wrote. But Locke provides us with an interesting suggestion as to how to understand the motives and arguments of the materialists of the time. Does anything like this story stand up under examination?\n\nHere I look at only two cases: that of Hobbes, about which Locke knew to some extent, and that of Toland. There is, I argue, some truth in the suggestion that conceivability considerations play an important role in their arguments. The story is not nearly so simple, however, as one might think just from reading LockeÕs suggestion. On the one hand, we actually find Hobbes arguing against the use of conceivability arguments, albeit conceivability arguments he thinks are used to support belief in immaterial beings. And on the other, though Toland does make use of a conceivability argument, itÕs far from the one that Locke suggests. There is a story to tell about the use of conceivability considerations by early modern materialists, but itÕs more complex than the one Locke tells. Neither Hobbes nor Toland is averse to arguing for materialism by using conceivability considerations, but neither does it in the straightforward way that Locke discusses and Masham endorses.\n\n## 4.2 HobbesÕs critique of conceivability arguments\n\nEven if Leibniz is right in his reading of Hobbes, we have to note that we can also find Hobbes arguing in De Corpore against othersÕ misuse of conceivability arguments. The key mistake he attributes to them lies in moving from the observations that we can talk about ÔAÕ and ÔBÕ, and can think about A without thinking about B, to the conclusion that A can exist without B existing. Hobbes gives at least three examples of this alleged error: thinking there can be thought without a body; thinking there can be accidents (e.g., quantity and heat) without body; and thinking there are such things as Òseparated essencesÓ. 47 Hobbes seems to\n\n46 Masham to Leibniz, 8 August 1704, WFNS 216-7, GP 3.359. On the arguments discussed in this paragraph, see note 5 above.\n\n47 De Corpore , chapter 3, section 4. Thomas Hobbes, Part I of De Corpore , translated by\n\nthink that the view that there are Òseparated essencesÓ is a view of both Aristotle and the later scholastic tradition. 48 The view that certain accidents can exist apart from body is plausibly also a view of many members of that tradition. And the view that thought can exist without body is a view both of members of that tradition and of Descartes. Let me think a little about this, with particular reference to views about the mind.\n\nThe Latin edition of Leviathan gives us more detail about what Hobbes thought Aristotle thought. 49 AristotleÕs first mistake in this realm, Hobbes claims, was to think that there are certain things, essences, that correspond to the word ÔisÕ. Even if we grant that there are essences though, Aristotle still seems to have gone wrong, because he thought, Hobbes claims, that some essences could exist apart from beings of which they are the essences. Hobbes gives two examples. The first sort of separated essences discussed are heavenly separated essences, which Òare present to the spheres of the heavens and drive them in a circular motionÓ. 50 HobbesÕs second example of an allegedly separated essence is the human soul. One possible source for this claim in AristotleÕs work is De Amina 1.1, which suggests, at least conditionally, the independent existence of the soul: ÒIf there is any way of acting or being acted upon proper to soul, soul will be capable of separate existenceÓ. 51 Another possible textual basis for HobbesÕs claim is De Amina 3.5: a mysterious passage, but one that might be taken to claim that thought is in some sense a form, and that it is in some sense separable. 52 Indeed, this seems to have been a key text for those who tried to form a coherent whole from Christian theology and Aristotelian philosophy, for it offered an opportunity to\n\nA.P. Martinich (New York: Abaris Books, 1981), 231.\n\n48 ThereÕs often some ambiguity whether HobbesÕs target is a view of AristotleÕs, or a view that later scholastics developed from an Aristotelian base. Often his approach is to criticize both a core view he attributes to Aristotle, and related uses of the view by later Aristotelians. For a further example, see Thomas Hobbes, Behemoth; or, The Long Parliament , edited by F. Tšnnies (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1990) 41-2.\n\n49 Leviathan , Latin edition 46.17.\n\n50 HobbesÕs textual basis for this claim may include Metaphysics 12.8. This is CurleyÕs speculation in his edition of Leviathan , p474, n10. Further technical classification, distinguishing these forms from the more usual sort, grew up in the area. See Dennis Des Chene, LifeÕs Form: Late Aristotelian Conceptions of the Soul (Ithaca: Cornell University Press,  2000), 77.\n\n51 403a10-1. For Aristotle, I use the translations of The Complete Works of Aristotle: The Revised Oxford Translation , edited by Jonathan Barnes (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1984).\n\n52 430a10-26.\n\nconnect AristotleÕs ideas to claims about immortality. 53 As a claim about Aristotle, what Hobbes says may seem dubious. As a claim about what others constructed out of Aristotelian and other materials, itÕs not so strange. Thus Aquinas, for instance thought both that the soul was a form, naturally united to body, and that it could exist apart from a body to which it was united. 54\n\nHobbesÕs remarks appear then to have both Aristotle and Aristotelians as targets. But they are not his only targets. Hobbes is also attacking Descartes. When Hobbes talks about the Ògross errors of certain metaphysiciansÓ one of his examples is of philosophers who Òfrom the fact that it is possible to consider thinking without considering body É infer that there is no need for a thinking bodyÓ. 55 That appears to pick out, among other things, DescartesÕs Sixth Meditation argument for a real distinction between mind and body. There Descartes claims that Òthe fact that I can clearly and distinctly understand one thing apart from another is enough to make me certain that the two things are distinctÓ. 56 Descartes argues, via that claim, from his ability to clearly and distinctly conceive of mind apart from body and vice versa, to the conclusion that mind and body are really distinct. Abstracting away from the details, this is an argument from the conceivability of mind without body to the conclusion that the mind is not physical, which is one of the arguments targeted in the Ògross errorsÓ passage.\n\nDescartes, though, did not endorse the claim that if I can conceive of AÕs existing without BÕs existing, then A can exist without B existing , but the weaker claim that (given certain other views, particularly about God) if I can clearly and distinctly conceive of AÕs existing without B existing, then B can exist without A existing . A special sort of conceivability, clear and distinct conceivability, is involved here. And only conceivability of this sort can, for Descartes, license the move to possibility. HobbesÕs objection appears to ignore this important aspect of DescartesÕs argument.\n\nWhatever the merits of HobbesÕs arguments, they add up to his making a case for\n\n53 See Hugh Lawson-TancredÕs discussion in his introduction to his translation of AristotleÕs De Anima (London: Penguin, 1986), 90-100.\n\n54 For discussion of AquinasÕs view, see Stump, Aquinas (London: Routledge, 2003) 191216.\n\n55 De Corpore , chapter 3, section 4.

So he does in a sense use conceivability to argue for materialism. But his approach doesnÕt fit LockeÕs story. What Hobbes is doing is more like LockeÕs criticism of an argument for dualism than it is like LockeÕs description of an argument for materialism. Conceivability is at work in HobbesÕs argument, but not in the same way itÕs said in Essay IV.iii.6 to motivate materialism. Indeed, in almost exactly the opposite way. So though Ð perhaps because we agree with LeibnizÕs reading of Hobbes, or because we note MashamÕs argument Ð we might think thereÕs something to LockeÕs comment, itÕs far from being the whole story.\n\n## 4.3 TolandÕs use of conceivability\n\nToland was writing after Locke, so Locke could hardly have had him in mind. But if we think in general about the role that conceivability plays in TolandÕs defence of materialism, what do we see? We see, I think, a complex use of conceivability considerations to defend materialism. Toland is not entirely adverse to arguing in this way. But his employment of conceivability considerations is far from the crude one that Locke sketches in the Essay .\n\nTo see this, look at how Toland apparently adopted the active matter view as a way of making his view more Leibnizian, and in response to LeibnizÕs criticisms. 57 ThereÕs little explicit and direct evidence here. However, this is a plausible way to reconstruct the evolution of TolandÕs position into the active matter view of Letters to Serena .\n\nIn their 1702 exchanges, Leibniz thought Toland was a Hobbesian materialist, and there was no sign of the active matter view. Leibniz thought, however, that this materialism was inadequate. As he put the point to Sophie on 9 September 1702, ÒToland doesnÕt say why matter has motion and order, nor why there is sense in the worldÓ. Moreover, in his next letter to Sophie Leibniz saw the solution as lying in an underlying activity: ÒI think that we ought to look for the origin of action, perception, and order underneath matter, that is, underneath that which is purely passive and indifferent to movementÓ. 58 And indeed, we can see the active matter view as a response to just this criticism of LeibnizÕs. At the very least, it\n\n57 The classic version of such a reading is F. H. Heinemann, ÒToland and LeibnizÓ, Philosophical Review 54 (1945) 437-57.\n\n58 These are the two letters from which I quoted longer passages in the section on TolandÕs materialism.\n\ngives Toland a way to explain why there is motion in the world.\n\nMoreover, Leibniz himself claimed to see Toland moving in his direction as their debate went on. In the last letter of the series transmitted via Sophie Charlotte,  Leibniz says this.\n\nI see nowhere where he directly attacks the immateriality of the soul. He recognizes apparently that the features [ notions ] of matter, size and impenetrability, are purely passive and canÕt give a principle of action, and that the modifications of these material features [ notions ], figures and movements, the machine, can produce neither perception nor thought (GP 6.517).\n\nThat is, Leibniz writes as if Toland has already moved in some way towards LeibnizÕs position. For previously Leibniz had objected to Toland on such points, and now he finds that Toland ÒrecognizesÓ the issue. Personally, I find that hard to discern from the letter to which Leibniz is replying. But it is a small piece of evidence in favour of the idea that Toland didnÕt just change his view, but changed his view in response to LeibnizÕs criticisms.\n\nAnother sign of Toland moving in LeibnizÕs direction, this one from 1704, comes from LeibnizÕs letter on Letters to Serena . There Leibniz praises TolandÕs distinguishing between local motion and motive force (Tognon 1983, 791). So again Leibniz thinks of Toland as having changed his position in the right, Leibnizian, direction. Admittedly, neither of these texts exactly addresses TolandÕs modification of his materialism (by adopting the active matter view) in response to LeibnizÕs criticisms. But they do support the relevant, more general thought, that Toland was to some extent persuaded by Leibniz, and was willing to modify his position in response to Leibnizian criticism.\n\nOne might worry that Leibniz only makes the most relevant criticism Ð the one to which IÕm saying Toland was responding Ð in letters to Sophie, rather than in letters to Toland. ThereÕs nothing exactly parallel in those letters to Toland via Sophie Charlotte. There is a lack of very direct and explicit evidence. Mind you, there are also obvious gaps in our record of the exchange, so we can hardly say with say certainty that Toland did not hear of this Leibnizian criticism. And notice what happened. Leibniz saw TolandÕs view, points out a problem, and suggests a solution. Two years later, Toland published a modified view, adopting just that solution. It would almost be remarkable if Leibniz didnÕt have something\n\nto do with this change.\n\nIf we understand the evolution of TolandÕs views in that way, then we can see his conceivability argument for active matter as a complex use of conceivability considerations to defend materialism. This is not the rather crude conceivability argument for materialism envisaged and criticized by Locke. Rather it is the use of conceivability to support the evolution of a more complex form of materialism. This, like HobbesÕs invoking conceivability to argue against Aristotelian and Cartesian immaterialism, gives us a small insight into the complex issue of how seventeenth- and early-eighteenth-century materialists supported their unpopular positions. LockeÕs story is far too simple Ð perhaps obviously so. But when we look at some of the details, we do see conceivability arguments at work. ItÕs just that theyÕre not all working in the way LockeÕs comments suggest they would be.\n\nWe end up, then, with a picture of Toland as a materialist rather more like Hobbes than Spinoza. Indeed in 1702 Toland seems to have been arguing for Hobbesian materialism against Leibniz. This exchange lead him to change his views in response to LeibnizÕs criticisms. In some ways his view did get closer to LeibnizÕs. But he became a Hobbesian who believed that matter was active rather than passive, not a Leibnizian or a Spinozist. To defend this new materialism against Leibniz, Toland used a conceivability argument. That lends support to LockeÕs thought that materialists were motivated by conceivability. But the conceivability argument used by Toland is far from the crude one pointed to by Locke. This (together with reflecting on some of HobbesÕs arguments) suggests that we might well tell a Lockean story about reasons for early modern materialism, but not LockeÕs story.",
