However, having died in 1804, two years before Mill was born, Kant himself could not have perceived his theory in the light of this contrast. Of course, he did stress the opposition between his conception of morality a8 baged on duty for duty's sake and a teleological conception of morality according to which the purpose of moral action is to maximize human happiness. Today we typically deecribe this contrast as that between teleological where the morally right i8 gpecified through an antecedent conception of the good, and deontological theory where the right is not defined in terms of the great theory good\n\nWhile this schematic characterization is consistent with Kant's own attempt to distinguish his conception of morality duty-based from \"heteronomous, happiness-based conceptions\\_ it does not capture other motivations behind his moral theory. For one thing, thinking of a deontological theory as that which defines the right independently of the can be misleading As John Rawls has pointed out, we might infer that which would be crazy Although Kant does think that the moral worth of an action is determined by the agent8 intention, he is concerned with the intentions of real actions with determinate consequences, not simply with empty intentions that are never put to the test in action. Bood\n\nFor another our present-day understanding of what makes an ethical theory deontological can also cauge us to distort the historical context influencing Kant'8 understanding of what is to be included in a complete account of morality. Deontological theories may not start with theory of the good, but that does not mean Kant should have completely ignored the relation of morality and the Kant scholars in the past have maintained that Kant need not have added arguments that the purguit of the moral life entails the supposition of the highest good, that these arguments endangered his effort to separate the moral concern for the right from the prudential hope for reward ? Kant, however ,recognizes that a theory of the right ignoring the good could lead to the formulation of eccentric principles or could not rule out &amp; conception of moral worth and the moral life which would be fanatical. thing; good. and\n\nFurthermore, Kant's own understanding of the major alternatives to his view i6 different from ours, given our tendency to contrast him with Mill. Again it is John Rawle who reminds us that Kant was arguing not only against teleological but also against a rival form of deontological theory which Rawls calls rational intuitioniem\\_ This tradition runs from Plato eventually to Moore and Ross, although Kant knew it in the of Leibniz' and Wolffs perfectionism\\_ The theories contrast with Kants 'constructivism ~The distinctive feature, then, of intuitionistic views is not their being teleological or deontological, but the especially prominent place that they give to the appeal to our intuitive capacities unguided by constructive and recognizably ethical criteria \" Both Millø principle of utility Kants construction of the categorical imperative are intended to provide reflective procedures that substitute for intuition. Rational intuitionism is still \"heteronomous for Kantians; although in less obvious sense than happiness-based theories are It accepts the distinction between the natural order and the moral order, and it recog nizes that moral concepts are non-natural cannot be intuited through the sensory media. But it maintains that the moral principles reflect an independently given moral order that is grasped through a different intuition; one that is purely rational . Kants notion of autonomy would make the postulation of a prior, independent (and therefore heteronomous) moral order unnecessary. His theory shows instead how moral principles are obtained not through intuition but through thought alone, that is, through the formal procedures of reason. theory, guise and and\n\nToo much stress on these formal procedures, however, has also distorted our perception of Kant'8 full theory of morality. In addition to the most general formulation of the categorical imperative, Kant offers four other versions, without explaining exactly how these are derived from theorig inal formula or how they are conceptually connected with one another. Since Kant himself does more to illustrate and explicate the first two principles (the law of nature and the end-in-itself formulations) than the autonomy and kingdom of ends principles; commentators have worked through these in greater detail , even though the latter two probably have greater eppeal.\n\nThese   formulations can be characterized roughly as follows. The categorical imperative is not a specific moral command, but &amp; general formula to which any specifically moral command would have to conform \"Act only on that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it should become universal law is admittedly formal, since it does not give me enough content to tell me exactly what I must do in find out what is meant by \"universal law, procedure for seeing whether the rule 1 want to follow in a particular action could be a To follow the procedure, ask whether the personal principle or maxim on which [ am about to act particular case could be generalized 80 that anybody could act on it\n\nin comparable circumstances. Itry to see what would happen if the ciple were a of human nature, such that everybody could always be everybody acting consistently on this principle, or could not really want (or \"will\" what would result, then conclude that the principle is not one [ could include in the set of rationally acceptable reasons on which everyone could act consistently: While this test might not provide sufficient reason for thinking that I had thereby identified moral a8 distinct from other kinds of principles, it would at least establish prima facie necegsary condition that any moral principle would have to satisfy. On this conception of morality moral principles are valid universally; that is, if 1 find that a type of action i8 right or wrong for me, must also believe it to be right or wrong for anyone prinlaw\n\nWhile the first, or \"law of nature, formula thus readily \"derives\" in a certain sense from the most general statement of the categorical imperathat every rational has an absolute value in itself, and ought not be treated simply a means to own ends, but However, if [ value myself because can apply the universalization test and conform to the categorical imperative, but recognize when perform the procedure that the implication is that any other person could and should also perform it, then Ishould value in them what [ value in myself, nection after all between the first and second formulations. In turn, this capacity leads me to think ofboth myself and others as autonomous. This thought becomes the third formulation, whereby \"the will of every rational being\" is acknowledged a8 0 will that \"makes universal law\" (p union of these autonomous agents under common principles. These principles are laws because they apply to all, but also because the laws are the same principles each rational being could agree to legislate to itself and thus to generalize to others. being my\n\nThis last formulation sums up the others and adds the attractive ideal of a moral community produced by unanimous; uncoerced agreement to the principles regulating permissible action. Autonomy and agreement to respect it are central moral and social ideals. If are only ideals however, and can never be realized in moral practice, they become abstract, and their appeal becomes thin. This abstractness is precisely what worries Hegel, who is the most notable early critic of Kant in that he recognizes the attraction of the Kantian notions but thinks are inadequate without a fuller, more concrete social-historical philosophy Hegels worrieg are shared by later critics who have fears in turn about Hegel's own solutions. To show both why Hegel's response to Kant is justified, but why Kant's moral philosophy remains vital , [ will continue my discussion of Kant's ethics by considering how it looks when viewed through Hegel's eyes. In this way will be reconstructing an important they they\n\nbut frequently ignored chapter in the history of ethics while showing its pertinence to present-day ethical theory.\n\n## L HEGEL'S SOCIAL ETHICS\n\nKant tell us about Hegel' own conception ofethics. Hegel attacks Kantian morality in many of his writings, but instead of then stating a different moral theory, he goe8 on to discussion of gome other topic, for instance religion or the state. Herbert Marcuse concludes from this tendency to change the topic that Hegel does not have a systematic ethics, but T. M Knox infers the contrary, namely, that Hegel's ethics is surreptitiously Kantian. W. H. Walsh thinks that the logical consequence of Hegel's position appears unsatisfying because it \"leaves no room for personal morality of any kind\" (p. 18).* Alan Donagan expresses this dissatisfaction by inverting Hegel'8 argument that Kantian Moralität , which allows the private individual to appeal beyond social mores to universal moral standards, is empty, and that concrete values come instead from Sittlichkeit, the social order. 0 case in Nazi Austria; Donagan argues that what is empty is Sittlichkeit , not Moralität, since individuals need to be able to dissent in times when the society is manifestly evil. To charges that Hegel's theory is socially relative in dangerous ways; Rossvaer responde in turn that Hegel'8 notion of Sittlichkeit i8 a \"legitimate extension\" of Kant's theory, one that recognizes that social institutions are themselves designed to make the moral oughts become what actually is the case Citing Viggo\n\nSo if thinking of morality purely private matter of the individual's conscience seems too abstract, the Hegelian criticisms should show that moral reflections are vacuous unless they take account ofthe social world in which they will be realized a8 concrete actions. From the Hegelian's perspective on morality 88 geen from the more inclusive context of Sittlichkeit, social action that is al8o moral will not need to be analyzed in terms of Kant's metaphysical dualisms between reason and inclination, intentions and consequences; or the sensible and the intelligible realms: Whereas   Kant   thinks moral leads   directly to religious  and metaphysical postulates, Hegel deliberately leads it in another direction. He can be understood historically as going beyond Kant's effort to secularize moral philogophy Kant begins this process by grounding moral philosophy in reason alone, not in religion. postulates may follow moral beliefs, says but morality is not derived from religious   premisses. In going privatemoral   conscience religious beliefs but and historical   considerations (which could include religion seen as a social institution), Hegel extends the process of secularizing moral philosophy . Marcuse and Knox could thus both be right, since Hegel's is not to replace Kants moral philosophy with another, competing moral philosophy, but to accept it, a8 theory Religious Kant, from from goal\n\nwhile recognizing its limitations; as a special case of a larger theory of social   action In the Hegelian jargon, standpoint   recognizing Sittlichkeit, Moralität i8 thus aufgehoben, that is, Kants formal procedures will be both \"negated\" (criticized for their limitations) and \"preserved\" (embedded in a more inclusive philosophy). from\n\nThe most well-known objections to Kantian ethics are those in the Philos ophy of Right (1821) and the Phenomenology of Spirit (1807). complete summary is found in the entry on Kant in the Lectures on the History of Philosophy, and somewhat sketchier is the comparable piece in the smal ler, \"Encyclopedia Logic (1817). Despite the various purpogeg of these different works; the line he takes against Kant is remarkably consistent. He formulates his line early, as we can see from his notebooks of 1798. Other than unpublished work, good indication of his earlier polemics the \"Natural Law\" essay of 1802-03 There Hegel begins his discussion of Kant by lauding the great accomplishment of Kant in placing the Absolute wholly within practical philosophy. What is striking about this claim is that while this project of giving priority to practical reason was principal task of post-Kantian philogophy, for many of us today the project is mainly of historical intereet. Ethics i8 simply one division of philosophy, and epistemology another. Clearly neither Hegel nor Kant would understand the present lack of interest in their connection.\n\nAlthough Kant was right in Hegels eyes to give the priority to practical reason, Hegel believes Kant did s0 only abstractly, not concretely. What, however, does he mean by 'abstract\" and 'concrete\"? Hegel certainly cannot mean that Kant speaks too much about the sheerly formal categorical imperative and not enough about real moral issues or the application of moral rules to concrete situations. Hegel knows Kant's later Tugendlehre a8 well a8 the Grundlegung; and more significantly, Hegel spends less time than Kant in talking about abstract moral rules are to be applied in concrete situationg. The terms abstract and concrete are not coterminous with form and content, but have more to do with overcoming dualism, and with explaining what Kant thought we could not, namely, how the dualistic oppositiong are really related. To think abstractly , a8 the faculty of understanding (or Verstand) does, means to make artificial distinctions and to consider multiple elements not in their unity (as reason or Vernunft does, concretely) but in their diversity. how\n\nThe examples in the \"Natural Law\" essay are intended to out what Hegel calls the \"formalism of the Kantian position The term is misleading because it suggests that the form-content and not the abstractconcrete distinction i8 at stake: Hegel includes in his critique of formalism critique of social contract theory: This critique could extend to more recent contractarian theories; especially those where the contract is counterfactual, since the point is that a contract to which no one has agreed is not really a contract at all, and not binding. A theory hypothesizing a bring\n\nstate of nature and a social contract proceeds by abstracting from human interaction whatever seems to be possible only in a state of law. Then it takes what is left (for instance, sympathy, antipathy, or indifference) and postulates this as human nature. Hegel thinks this operation is simply a way of presupposing the desired outcome. Abstraction breaks persons into atomic entities with atomic qualities, and loses their concrete unity Or at most this unity is given an empty label, which simply says we do not know what else to say As Hegel gayg, social contract theory has to call this unity by \"the empty name of a formless and external harmony called 'society 'state Phenomenology where he attacks the Roman conception of the state for thinking of the state a9 simply an aggregate of individuals; all of whom are essentially alike, without differentiation An abstract conception of society   will yield only an abstract conception of its members.  Seeing ourselves from such an external objective view alienates us from the desires and interests that most motivate u8, and even from the non-egoistic, communal projects that transcend individual self-interest. and\n\nThe thrust of Hegel'8 remarke in both texts is that the Kantian kingdom of ends is not a useful model for understanding the construction of social norms society is a complex unity of diverse elements, not a logical class or an eggregate of individuals sharing single essence or aim Hegel is opposed to Kant's \"cosmopolitan\" ideal of a universal history in which social and cultural differenceg are gradually dissolved a8 we try to in mind, ol course, that people would be like one another only in their rights and obligations. Citing Monteequieu, Hegel in the \"Natural Law\" egsay prefers an account that will identify the specific characters of different  peoples and recognize differences  between different times and configurationg. Hegel makes these points again in the later philosophies of right and of history; but even here he is clearly opposed to Kant's League of Nationg, or social union ofsocial unions. For Hegel the Kantian theory of persons expects too much of philoeophy, which can only try to understand the individuality of past cultures without projecting the necesoutcome of the future. In a passage that anticipates the famous \"owl ofMinerva\" image in the preface tothe Philosophy of Right, Hegel says, sary\n\nWe must look for a time in which the specific feature, fixed in law but now ethos and in harmony with the rest of the laws. But beyond precisely this aim to know, the effect of a purely historical explanation of laws and institutions cannot go. It would exceed its function and truth il it were uBed to justily, for the present time, the law which had Jiving\n\nPhilosophy can try to discern the best features of the past or the present but it should not project an ideal world as the measure and for the present. On note also sounded in the later Philosophy of Right, Hegel goal\n\nconcludes the \"Natural Law' essay with an attack on the separation of the real and the ideal societies. Philoeophy cannot glimpse the abeolute mopolitanism; still less into the void of the Rights of Man, or the like void of a league of nationg or world republic. These are abstractions and formalisms filled with exactly the opposite of ethical vitality\" (pP. 132-33).\n\nAnother way Hegel expresses his dissatisfaction with Kant's formulationg of moral laws isto argue that the laws are only analytic and tautological. Kant, of course, would been stung by this charge since his aim was toexplain the possibility of synthetic, not analytic, a priorijudgments. Hegel'ø charge would aløo apply againgt Fichte, whoge program i8 deduce makes a mistake in trying to derive all the detaile of a moral philosophy ciple may explain everything, and therefore nothing, since it would be 80 general that it could not prevent conflicts arising either between passions  and duties, different moralities. In the Phenomenology, for example, he takes Sophocles' Antigone a8 a paradigm of a conflict between two equally compelling moral frameworks, the public duties to the (human law) and the private duties to the family (divine law). Antigone's duty is both to bury her brother and not to bury her brother, and she cannot do her duty without violating her duty. have polis is genuine. He believes that Kant is sanguine about the progpect of eliminating conflicts of duties through the construction of a complete moral theory baged on moral theory could accomplish are too inflated as a result of his equally overconfident meta-philoeophical beliefs about what philogophy such can accomplish. While Hegel's \"abeolute idealism\" geems to expect much more of human reason than Kant's \"transcendental idealism which sets rigid limits on the uge of reason, Hegel's conception of philosophy is less absolutist and foundational than Kants. Rather than basing philosophy on &amp; single principle, or on the secure foundation of the transcendental deduction of the objective validity of the subjective categories; Hegel thinks there is no single privileged starting point for philosophy, and the best we can try to do (but will probably never finish) is to show how all our concepts and principles are tied to all our other concepts and princisingle Idea or absolute, it is only the philosophical hypothesis that all our rational principles are somehow connected, and we can find out how. too\n\nThe antecedent for this criticism of Kants moral philosophy is a point moral and this content alone concerns 1d pure practical reason isto be abstracted elf-contradiction t seek in this absolute ion which would have to have 8 content, 8 to none \" law, have\n\nmetaphysical conception of the Wille is vn claim at the end of the Grundlegung comprehensibility of the moral will and not dissolve this worry.

Hegel is worried by our hermeneutical capacity to change the situation by changing its interpretation, and he thinks that the abetractof the Kantian program makes hermeneutical re-interpretation all too easy. In the essay on natural law he suggests; for instance, that the Kantian moralist slide8 toward a casuistry he typically attributes also to the Jesuits and the Eudaemonists, whose \"perversion and trickery\" is generated by turning \"anything specific into &amp; duty\" (p: 79). He thinks that in practice all generalize the matter rather than the form of the moral judgment, for example, by making property itself an absolute duty. \"But when a specific and individual thing is elevated to something inherently [necessary], he says, \"absurdity and, in the moral sphereimmorality are posited\" (p. 78). Later, in the section on Kantian Moralität in the Phenomenology (Chapter VI, Section C), he will dramatize the dissemblance of this logical abeurdity to show that in practice it leads to hypocrisy , or to what Kant himself calls in the Lectures of Philosophical Theology an absurdum practicum they\n\nHegel'ø own approach i8 to make hermeneutical variability more difficult (although not impossible) by spelling out in addition to the moral theory social and historical theory. Of course, by writing different \"philoeophy ofright\" another theorist could etill the interpretation of what i8 required in a particular situation, but that task is much less easily done. In sum, Hegel cannot accept the Kantian insistence on the primacy and autonomy of personal morality vis-a-vis all other practical (social, political, and historical) considerations. change'\n\n## KANTIAN REBUTTALS\n\nHas Hegel missed the of Kant'8 procedural tests of moral maxims? Two lines of response must be considered. One is that Hegel misunderstands the Kantian requirement that moral maxims be generalized. Another is that Hegel underestimates the constructivist emphasis on procedures for establishing principles, sothat even ifhisobjectionsto Kant were valid, are too specific to undercut the more general Kantian that generalizable principles will pot promulgate doctrine but establish procedures. The broader appeal of the Kantian conception of ethics is that it does not first insist on particular content, but instead euggests that agents will act to achieve certain ends only ifthe ends are determined by point they point\n\nfair procedures. The second point may well be valid, although to press it against Hegel would be anachronistic since it involves &amp; present-day interpretation ofthe Kantian program which Hegel could not have anticipated in detail. The first point, however, bears close attention.\n\nA good illustration of the first line of response, which [ will discuss in detail in this section, is in Marcus Singer's Generalization in Ethics Accusing Hegel'8 objection of \"almost incredibly simple-minded Singer believes that it 'entirely ignores the fact that the maxim of an action, which is what the categorical imperative is designed to test, is itself &amp; 'determinate principle of conduct' and 'already possesses a content\" (p. 251). If what I have said 8o far is right, Hegel himself is claiming precisely that only the given maxims, and not the contradiction or end-initself tests, have content S0 what Hegel wants to is where this content comes from, and why. Hegel is urging that there i8 a more basic question, namely, why the given content and its implied conditions (for instance, society with private property) is necessarily desirable. being know\n\nSinger mentions two corollaries of Hegel'8 objections to Kant, but sells them short. One is the objection that since the categorical imperative is strictly formal, it can be applied only by presupposing the content of a determinate maxim. Thus, some might think that they can flout the practice of keeping promiges even though they recognize that if everybody did so all the time, there could be no promises. The promise-flouter might aggert simply that a society without promising was conceivable; and might be able togive reasons for preferring such a society . Singer underestimates the promise-flouter's potential for sophistry when 88y8, 'By the fact that one has made a promise one indicates that he regards the practice as a useful one, whether he now wishes to break a promise or not, and thus that he would regard the elimination of the practice as undesirable\" (p. 293). This inference does not neceesarily follow, however , since the anarchist promise-flouter could simply exploit the gullibility of bourgeois promise-keepers, perhape with the intention of bringing about society in which people were no longer involved in the kinds of exploitative relations that required promises. So although [ think that to believe promise-making useful only in our society and not in the best one is seriously mistaken, I do not think the belief i8 unintelligible. Singer very\n\nThe second corollary has to do with whether the contradiction test would preclude apparently immoralor fanatical maxims. 'expresses the Hegelian objection a if it 8aid conduct can be universalized provided one doe8 not care what happens\" (p. 294). He then slightly misrepresents the point of the objection by arguing in reply that no one can really not care about anything at all since no one can be completely indifferent to outcomeg of actions. Even ifhe were right, and indeed Hegel well agree, the crux must lie elsewhere. Hearing the ambiguous idiom, \"one doeg not care what happens, in the relevant way would not rule out a fanatic caring about and wanting to accomplish some outcome (for instance, the outcome where everybody, including himself, would Singer \"any could ake a mistake about the use of ion of an ideal society will serve ical societies.\n\nin his account of the issue about if everyone stole, whenever and uch thing a property and hence bsence of property Yet he seems ore be to steal . Kant never nce of property is a logical necesction t0 commit theft or murder , wrong\n\ncould not be universalized rty and nothing to steal.  Hegel not follow. There could still be e rather short. As soon as [ left se'8 property, for instance, someling ig particular point, however. He sk why it should therefore follow The Phenomenology is not at all (pp. 257-58),\n\nn absolute law that there should dict itself Non-property; the vnership of goods, is just as little er, to each according to his need erminateness, a formal thought, omething that belongs to nobody ed disagreeing with Kant. Singer s argue that the absence of propnoint\n\nwhat in Roman law is called res nullius. Kant thinks that this concept leads to the absurdity of property that is not property \\_ His argument the contradiction-in-willing test; maintaining roughly that the will cannot place its own objects outside itself by decreeing that they Kant's own strategy of argumentation to show that the same method could be used to prove that property is contradictory: applies using\n\nWhat I possess is a Thing, i.e., something which is for others in general me in &amp; quite general, undefined way; that posbess il an all-round contradiction as non-property Ip 259.)\n\nHegel does think that the absence of property would become problematic as soon a8 the question of need distribution arose. He believes that an individual cannot settle for taking and using what is needed at the moment, but must think universally, where universally meang at first for the sake of ones own life. So one will want to provide for meeting one's basic needs whenever they arise, and one will therefore want to secure If one is an the potentially conflicting needs of others, one will have to explain how one plans to provide for one's own needs in a world without the guarantees provided by property\\_ and\n\nThe sections on legislating and testing laws in the Phenomenology make clear that Hegel is objecting not to the idea of moral rules per se, but to the thought that isolated rules can be constructed and tested by isolated individuals. Only when we consider what other features we would want in society can we decide whether we would want property, and only then will we see whether we need moral injunctions against stealing: Hegel's lexical ordering of these reflections thus differs from Kant's, and leads to the larger of whether morality and legality can be kept strictly separate, as Kant wants. Hegel is opposed to Kant's metaphysical dualisms, and overcomes the separation of legality (or 'abstract right\" and Moralität through the more inclusive Sittlichkeit of the modern state\\_ The abstraction or thinness that results from leaving out the common social aspirations of a moral community can be seen in the Kantian ideal of a perfect constitution attainable even by a nation of devils acting solely on narrow 8elf-interest. issue\n\nHegel's scepticism about this ideal is probably justified by reflecting on prisoner's dilemma. If each of two prisoners who are isolated from each other could be rationally expected to minimize the freedom of the other by accusing the other of an alleged crime, there is no reason to think that a self-interested devil would be forced to protect the freedoms of others s0 that its own freedoms would also be protected. A civil society insisting only on legality and rights rather than mutually recognizing shared obligations and objectives is for Hegel degenerative form of the\n\nSittlichkeit. His larger concerns receive support when one tries to explain why members of a country feel morally distressedor even morally strained by the actions of that country (for instance, in an unjust war), despite their individual inability to prevent the repugnant deeds.\n\nAnother example that illustrates Hegel'8 line and that does not depend on the arcane issue of res nullius occurs in both the Natural Law and the Phenomenology. The case concerns the apparent conflict between on demand money held in trust. Kant, of course, thinks the personal maxim could not be universalized   without destroying the practice of entrusting financial deposits. Singer is right to amend Kant's formulation into the more restricted form, \"everyone may keep a deposit of which no one can produce proof; since the case a8 described by Kant would not destroy the institution of entrusting funds, but only the practice of entrusting funds without keeping a sanctioned receipt. Hegel is willing togrant that thecontradiction of conception test would lead to an inability to entrust funds. The problem that then emerges is a deeper one, namely, whether entrusting funds is a degirable practice: 'But where is the contradiction if there were not deposits? The non-existence of deposits would contradict other specific things, just together with other necessary specific things and thereby will itself be necessary \\_ Hegel's own approach is to see how certain concepts and practiceg are necessary if other ones are, and to construct these interconnections into a complex deecription of the whole society. But he thinks that this approach is not open to Kant, because it invokes unrelated consequenceg and other material ends instead of settling the rightness wrongness of a specific type ofconduct across all possible social worlds.\n\nWhile Hegel's point is well-taken, it raises problem that his own overstatement heighteng.  When dealing with this example, eepecially in the Phenomenology, Hegel unfortunately gives the impression to some readers that the person entrusted with the funds can keepthem cavalierly:\n\nIf [ should keep for myself what i8 entrusted to me, then according to the guilty of contradiction; for then [ no longer look upon it as the property of someone else: to hold on to something which Ido not regard as belonging to 8omeone else is perfectly consietent.\"\n\nBut Hegel is aware that although consistent, the action would be morally wrong. So he is not condoning it, but instead suggesting that the Kantian who insists that the consistency test determines what iø permissible would have to condone it. In present parlance, Hegel is showing how the theory and practice of Kantian morality deconstructs itself. day\n\nThe further problem is, however, that Hegel himself does not go beyond deconstruction and identify better grounds for condemning the violation. To say that the social practices as a whole condemn it is at best problematic. What about society of thieves? In their own terms are their own\n\nviolations of trust then moral, and the keeping of trust immoral? Can an evil group consider itself good, and other groups a8 less clever? That Hegel is not willing t0 relativize values to this extent i8 shown by the fact that his paradigm case of conflicts of moralities is ancient Greece, not hypothetical nations of devils or societies of thieves\n\nHe wants to hold on to deontological commitment to the morally right just because it is right, not because of other extraneous factors. He thinks the Kantian tests, however, are not enough to block the possibility of fanatics who start from entirely different premisses.  His main point is thus summed up clearly in the next sentence: Alteration of the point of view [Ansicht] i8 not contradiction' (p. 262). The mistake of the Kantian procedures is to emphasize too much the standpoint of the individual practical reasoner . Hegel argues in contrast, \"It is not, therefore, because 1find something is not self-contradictory that it is right; on the contrary \"all such thinking\" a8 is involved in the Kantian universalization of abstract rules could upset person'8 understanding of what the right thing to do in a particular situation would be. Too much abstraction from context, and too much abstract reflection; will lose or destroy the perception and understanding of the demands of moral obligation in concrete situations\n\n## V. THE LIMITATIONS OF KANTIAN AUTONOMY\n\nFor Hegel Kant's reflective procedures imply the wrong phenomenology of moral experience. A more adequate phenomenological degcription of moral consciousness would have to start from the immediate claims moral obligations impose on us. Of course, we cannot go back to Antigone's Greece, or to a culture in which no reflective procedures are needed to ascertain one's obligations. Perhaps such a culture never really existed, and certainly our modern times lack this moral immediacy. The modern state is for Hegel the attempt of modern consciousness to regain the sense of social union in mediated way, through its social institutions.\n\nReflecting on Antigone; then, leads Hegel to a different phenomenology of duty. From one perspective, Hegel thinks that Kant underestimates moral conflict. Antigone'8 case is modern enough in that it ghows that genuine moral conflicts are unlikely to be avoided by the Kantian program of deriving all moral principles from the categorica] imperative: Kants Doc trine of Virtue could be thought of as representing duties in a hierarchy, or as lexically ordering duties, s0 that later duties are not legitimate claims ifa more primary duty is invoked. Hegel thinksthat because duties reflect our social roles, because these roles are not only multiple but often at odds with one another , a real conflict of duties cannot be resolved without some morally undegirable consequenceg. and\n\nFrom another perspective Hegel thinks that Kant makes too much of moral conflict. Genuine clashes of duties occur, Hegel believes; only excep- reduced to explicit rules or algorinms. hought that a teacher could state esis, the practical wiedom that guides ion is appropriate in specific situations. ity 8s a set of metaphysical or countertemporal rational being, but a8 a system in an existing ethical order. prin -\n\nd practices that cannot be fully articumoral system, namely, the ideal of autols intention is not tojettigon autonomy, f\"the pure unconditioned self-determinis, he asserts, an original achievement e powers ofindividual reason in thinking late the law using reason alone.

So if there is such a it applies to me not as an ideal rational like everyone else, a \"we that i8 merely the 'T\" many times over.

In this case one side does not really want the other side to defend that part of the country So normally \"defend your country\" i8 something said by members of one nation to other members of the same nation, not to members of some other warring nation ~we, agent duty, my\n\nTo challenge the autonomy of the isolated ego further, Hegel gives other illustrationg of how the moral reflection appears to be pure and unconditional, when in reality it is conditioned by implicit background assumptions. He takes the maxim 'everyone ought to speak the truth\\_ which seems like a fine ideal until we reflect on the tacit conditions that would also be invoked in considering how to apply it.:\" Of course, Hegel's example is not a direct counterexample to Kant, since one could think there is a moral injunction against lying as Kant doeg argue, without thinking this injunction also entailed a moral command always to speak the truth. Some truths are best left unsaid.\n\nHegels real point i8, surely, that understanding an assertion involves more than simply taking the words in some narrow sense and disregarding the tacit limitations provided by the context about what is and is not meant. His example is similar to Wittgenstein's, where &amp; parent instructs sitter to teach the children game and is startled on return to find they have been taught to gamble. The is that complex understanding of conditions is always required to understand an utterance. An explicit rule or belief is already nested in a background, and only against this background does the rule make sense. The is more than that there are implicit assumptions about the meaning of the rule which never be understood. The implication for practical reason is that concepts, beliefs, and rules are only part of what is involved in morality, point prior 'point could could the t.\" Hegel's objection amounts to saying ion to help the poor, a single individual and for efficacious results only action by is trying to show that the scope of the ention, for if the obligation is 80 general Id have little or no real effect, then the rious.

Apart from Hegel'ø polemical uses of the example the significant feature to then, is the way his analysis leads from the moral directly to the social and political. On his view, to separate the moral and the social entirely i8 a mistake While the freedom of conscience should be protected by society, morality is in turn social institution itself: The autonomy of morality should not be interpreted, therefore, implying that morality can ignore questiong about its social efficacy. try, note,\n\nWhile Hegel's demand that the social basis of morality be recognized is well-taken, the Kantian will not be satisfied with the way the historical Hegel connects the moral to the social. Today we could to John Rawls's theory of justice as one way the moral and the social could be connected. Although Rawls himself argues in Basic Structure as Subject\" that his theory takes Hegel's critique of Kantian morality into account, the Hegelian  will still find the theory all-too-Kantian.  The assumption of the original position represents an unhistorical idealization that abstracts from the concrete interests of particular individuals. Since the Hegelian believes these concrete interests are mogt ofen implicit features of background practices that could never be fully articulated in an explicit system of rules, the Hegelian would not beconvinced by Rawls's claim that the concrete interests could be adequately represented by the indifferent rational beings behind the veil of ignorance point ~The\n\nEven if this criticism of present-day contractarian theory is potentially right; Kantians will charge in turn that Hegels theory i8 inadequate if it fails to explain the problem of moral and social conilict. Advocates of Hegels theory may reply that its advantage over Kantian abstraction is that it recognizes that there will be moral and Bocialconflict, anddescribes why this must be the case. But Hegelians may also admit that as a guide for action the is not obviously helpful. Of course, perhaps philosophy should not be expected to produce &amp; theory with algorithms to decide the outcome of every particular practical action. Kant's theory is misleading in implying that philosophy could generate such algorithms. But Kantian will object further thet Hegel'8 theory often seems to imply that the moral considerations can be disregarded in the name of social and historical progress.

So a single individual or group could never justify immoral conduct for the sake of future ends. Only the historian looking back can say what was gained and what was sacrificed. The historian is not excusing the moral sacrifice, but only explaining the historical consequences In another apparently immora] passage Hegel discusses the difference between the moralist's and the historian's points of view: \"INJo representations should be made against world-historical deeds and those who perform them by moral circles to which such individuals do not belong. The of private virtues~modesty , humility, charity, liberality, etc.~must not be raised against them\" (p. 141). He is certainly overstating the case, since the historian might weli need to note the character of the individuals to understand the deeds. But the lack of the virtues Hegel lists is not exactly the same as &amp; mora] crime, and he is not suggesting that the historian should excuse the world-historical agent from moral assegsment. The historian will have other criteria for assegsing the gignificance of the action seen from its relation to the social , political , or historical epheres. litany\n\nWe must remember that Hegel is deecribing the methods ofthehistorian of world history, not the \"ordinary\" historian who portrays smaller slices of history, or who looks at special, restricted kinds of history; For the world historian the private moral worth of the world-historical agent is not the exclusive subject of concern. Hegel suggeste that the particular agent private, particular person may be ignored altogether because the scale of the historian's focus will need to be much broader:\n\nWorld history might well disregard completely the sphere to which morality and the much discussed and misunderstood dichotomy between morality and politics and not merely by refraining from judgements (for the principles of world and the necessary relationship of men's actions to these principles themselves constitute the judgement), but by ignoring individuals altogether and leaving them unmentioned; for what it has 1 is the activity of the spirit of nations, and the individual forms which the spirit has agsumed in the sphere of external reality could well be lent belong history record\n\nIn order not to misunderstand Hegel, one must not take these passages a8 justifying immoral means to historical ends, but a8 describing the scale and methods of world history, with its of patterns in events that the historical agents themselves would not have been likely to anticipate. goal seeing\n\nHegel thinks that the historian's of view is thus of a different order than that of a present political agent who needs to act and cannot avoid getting what Sartre calls \"dirty hands Hegel is often accused of a conservative precisely because he thinks political  philosophy should explain only the present social and political structure. Unlike Sartre's revolutionary who wrestles with the tension between unjust present actions and the ideal society the actions might promote, Hegel condemns political reasoning based on an allegedly ideal model because of point being nan the instruments of realising its will\" (p. 14 ot morally higher, of course, but is higher more historical and less individual-orien Jpoint the efficacy of moral resistance to tful.

But he   qualifies this way of   speaking immediately, and adds,\n\nBut this relation of end and means is not at all appropriate in the present context. For the state is not an abstraction which stands in opposition t0 the citizens; on the contrary, are distinct moments like those of organic life, in which no one member i8 either 0 means or an end. (p. 95.) they\n\nThe state and the individuals are not really different, even though there will be differences between one individual and others (p. 52) So finally the relation of the individual to the state is just one of several relations of the individual to other aspects of him- or herself. The state has no right to jeopardize these other aspects of the self:\n\nThis inner centre, this simple source of the rights of subjective freedom, the seat of volition, resolution, and action, the abstract content ofconscience that in which the responsibility and worth of the individual and his eternal court of judgement are contained all this remains untouched and (protected] from the noisy clamour of world history (P. 92.)\n\nSo the state must preserve the freedoms of conscience, and must enhance the Sittlichkeit of the community: \"The essence of the state is ethical life' (p. 95). The state i8 not the government, or even the political structure and power, but is itself a function of the ethical force that holds the community together and enables &amp; given political structure to work.\n\nSo while Hegel may not have illuminated completely the relation of morality and politics, he should not be accused of forgetting the role of moral reflection in life\\_ On the contrary, he wanted to describe the social place of morality in such a way that moral theory would be neither   overestimated nor   underestimated. If he does not solve the problem of the relation of the individual and the society, nevertheless he does force us to understand the complexity of the problem. positive result of wrestling with the Hegelian difficulties is that we will be less likely to rely too easily on the overly optimistic and abstract Kantian hopes for inevitable progress public\n\nUniversity of California, Santa Cruz\n\nReceived November 13, 1987\n\n## NOTES\n\n1.
