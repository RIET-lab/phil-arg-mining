I argue that Spinoza's commitment to an essentialist reading of striving helps to explain his profound, and somewhat underappreciated, break with Hobbes not only in terms of his views of  right and obligation, but also in terms of  his conceptions of  happiness and the good.\n\nThe structure of  this chapter is as follows: I open by examining the similarities between Hobbes's and Spinoza's views on motivation. This is followed by an analysis of  the distinct ways in which they understand striving, and in turn agency and artifice, showing how these differences are reflected in their conceptions of  civil life. Finally, I consider how the differences described in the preceding sections yield fundamentally different views of  goodness, happiness, liberty, and the function of the state.\n\n## Fundamentals of Moral Motivation\n\nThough Spinoza's debt to Hobbes is widely acknowledged in the scholarly literature, 2 the striking ways in which Spinoza's account of motivation resembles Hobbes's has not been fully charted. In this section I survey of some of the important connections. To appreciate their accounts of moral motivation, we must situate them in relation to the Scholastic model that they both sought to supplant.\n\nA Companion to Hobbes , First Edition.

Final causes were not only distinct from and irreducible  to  efficient  causes,  they  explained  the  efficacy  of   efficient  causes  themselves.  As Aquinas puts it: 'the end is the cause of the causality of the efficient cause, for it makes the efficient cause to be an efficient cause.' 3 For humans, goodness is the end of action, or that towards which the will is directed and which consequently shapes the particular desires by which we act. Even when we desire something that is not really good, we still pursue things under the appearance of the good, with goodness itself - along with our capacity to be apprehend and be drawn by its power - grounding any explanation of why we choose what we do. 4 Goodness, as the end of action or the object of the will, enables us to apprehend courses of action as choiceworthy in some respect.\n\nStill, Scholastics did not think that the apprehension of goodness alone fixes action, as this would imply an execrable form of intellectual determinism. Instead, they maintained that we possess another power - i.e., the liberty of exercise - by which we can perform or refrain from performing the action specified by the intellect. 5 The liberty of exercise is a self-determining power, a two-way ability to do or forebear. The Scholastic conception of action thus depended both on the explanatory independence (and priority) of final causes and a libertarian freedom of the will.\n\nHobbes and Spinoza reject both of these elements. Hobbes categorically denies the existence of a free will, claiming that it is flatly incompatible with the notion of  a cause, which is such that when all of the contributing factors are present 'it cannot be understood but that the effect is produced at the same instant; and if any one of them be wanting, it cannot be understood but that the effect is not produced' (EW I.122). 6 Since nothing exists for which there is not a total and sufficient cause, Hobbes infers that 'whatsoever is produced is produced necessarily … and therefore also voluntary actions are necessitated' (EW V .380). To appeal to a free will to explain action would be to invite an untenable regress: 'a man can no more say he will will, than he will will will, and so make an infinite repetition of the word will; which is absurd and insignificant' (EW IV .69).\n\nHobbes also rejects the view of final causes as grounding the efficacy of efficient causes. In response to Bramhall, he writes that any attempt to show that human action is 'moved not by an efficient [cause], is nonsense' (EW V .77; cf. EW I.131-2). Still, he admits that human actions can be explained in terms of ends, provided that we concede that the representation of an end 'is entirely the same as an efficient cause,' since the imagination of some pleasure gives rise to 'motion towards the desired object' (1976, 315; EW I.131-2). He inverts the priority relationship between appetites and goodness: we do not desire things because they are good; rather 'good' and 'evil' are just terms that denote that which we desire or imagine with pleasure (2012, 80-2; 1651, 24; see also EW IV .32).\n\nSpinoza denies free will and final causation on similar grounds. He asserts that 'in nature there is nothing contingent, but all things have been determined from the necessity of  the divine nature to exist and produce an effect in a certain way' (1p29; 1985, 433). 7 The view that everything that exists is necessary follows in part from his commitment to a robust version of the principle of sufficient reason (e.g., 1p11 alt. dem;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSTRIVING, HAppINESS, ANd THE Good: SpINozA AS FolloWER ANd CRITIC oF HoBBES\n\n1985,  417).  on  the  basis  of  his  necessitarianism,  he  straightforwardly  rejects  the notion of the will as a two-way power or faculty (see 2p48 [1985, 483]; 2p35s [1985, 473]; 1 Appendix [1985, 440]).\n\nSpinoza also rejects the standard view of final causes. Ethics 1 Appendix includes a protracted diatribe against natural teleology in which he claims that: 'all the prejudices I  here undertake to expose depend on this one: that men commonly suppose that all natural things act, as men do, on account of an end … Nature has no ends set before it … all final causes are nothing but human fictions' (1985, 439, 442). But while he denies that end-directed explanations are distinct from efficient causal explanations, he, like Hobbes, allows for reductive sense of final causation: 'What is called a final cause is nothing but a human appetite in so far as it is considered as a principle, or primary cause, of some thing … It is really an efficient cause, which is considered as a first cause, because men are commonly ignorant of the causes of their appetites' (4 preface; 1985, 544). Consequently, he also inverts Scholastic explanatory order, explaining 'ends' in terms of appetites, rather than the other way around (1 Appendix [1985, 442]; 3p9s [1985, 500]).\n\nWe see then that Hobbes and Spinoza not only reject these fundamental elements of Scholastic accounts of motivation, they do so for similar reasons. They are both determinists who deny the existence of free will on the grounds that it jars with causal sufficiency, and in place of the view of final causes as explaining the efficacy of efficient causes, they reduce final causes, or ends, to efficient causes. This clears the ground for their positive, naturalistic accounts of motivation.\n\n## Hobbes on Motivation\n\nAt the foundation of Hobbes's account of human motivation is the concept of endeavor or conatus in latin - which is defined as the 'small beginning of motion' (2012, 78; 1651, 23). The notion of conatus figures into nearly every aspect of Hobbes's philosophy , from his physics to his account of sense perception. 8 Unsurprisingly, then, it is the foundation of his  account  of  motivation:  'This  endeavour,  when  it  is  toward  something which causes it, is called appetite, or desire … And when the endeavour is from ward something, it is generally called aversion' (2012, 78; 1651, 23). Endeavor is the fount of  action.\n\nAppetites and aversions are not blind impulses, but rather 'depend always upon a precedent thought of whither , which way , and what ' (Hobbes 2012, 78; 1651, 23; see also 1972, 55). The specific thoughts that direct one's endeavor are anticipations of 'good and evil consequences' (2012, 94; 1651, 29; cf. EW V .357-8), or hedonic or painful representations of various courses of action (2012, 82; 1651, 25; see also EW IV .32). And to represent something as pleasant is to perceive it as good, representations of  goodness being nothing apart from pleasure, appetite, or love (EW V .390; EW IV .32; 1972, 47; EW II, 196; 2012, 80; 1651, 24; 2012, 242; 1651, 79). Ultimately, Hobbes folds a number of affective and motivational dimensions into his conceptions of pleasure and pain, claiming that pleasure and pain are themselves appetitive and aversive motions  and  that  passions  like  love,  hate,  hope,  and  fear  are  mere  permutations  of pleasure and pain. As he baldly puts it in Elements of  Law , 'pleasure, love, and appetite,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## JUSTIN STEINBERG\n\nwhich is also called desire, are divers names for divers considerations of the same thing' (EW 4, 32; cf. 2012, 80; 1651, 23-4). Hobbes thus advances a stripped-down account of  motivation: appetitive pleasure and aversive pain are motions that lead us toward or away from some object, and the representations of goodness and evil are simply manifestations of  appetitive pleasure or aversive pain (EW V .358; 2012, 90; 1651, 28; EW I.409-10).\n\nFinally, to get the full picture of  Hobbes on the metaphysics of motivation, we may observe that pleasure and pain are themselves rooted in a system's functioning:\n\nThis Motion, which is called Appetite, and for the apparence of it delight, and pleasure, seemeth to be, a corroboration of Vital motion, and a help thereunto; and therefore such things as caused delight, were not improperly called Jucunda, (A Juvando,) from helping or fortifying; and the contrary, Molesta, offensive, from hindering, and troubling the motion vital. (2012, 82; 1651, 25; cf. EW IV .31)\n\nUltimately, then, human motivation depends on how one's vital, preservational motions are affected.\n\n## Spinoza on Motivation\n\nStriving is also at the root of  Spinoza's account of  motivation: 'each thing, as far as it is it in itself  [ quantum in se est ], strives [ conatur ] to persevere in its being' (3p6; 1985, 498; translation modified). Striving is a thing's fundamental motive tendency: insofar as we are in ourselves, 9 we will do things that promote our being. This is the ground of everything that we do.\n\nBut what one does is not determined by one's conatus simpliciter , but rather by one's affective state, or how one's conatus is constituted (3 dA 1, expl; 1985, 531). There are three basic classes of affect: joy ( laetitia ),  sadness ( tristitia ),  and desire ( cupiditas ).  Joy and sadness are for Spinoza what pleasure and pain are for Hobbes: they are the fundamental springs of action that reflect changes to our vital activity . Joy marks an increase in one's power of acting, while sadness marks a decrease of this power. Not only does Spinoza follow Hobbes in explaining basic affects in terms of changes to one's preservational activities, he also accepts Hobbes's view that these basic affective states are complex intentional states, not blind, raw feelings. 10 Because affects are representational, they direct our striving so that we pursue things that we imagine with joy and avoid things that we imagine with sadness (3p12-13; 1985, 502).\n\nAs for desire, it is simply one's essence or striving insofar as this essence is constituted by a form of joy or sadness (3p56d [1985, 527]; cf. 3 dA I, expl. [1985, 531]). 11 on this view, the same 'mode' may be understood either as a form of joy (e.g., a love of an object)  or  as  a  desire  (a  striving  for  an  object),  depending  on  whether  or  not  one  is attending to the way in which this mode orients one's striving. desire is just an emotion considered strivingly . This reveals yet another way in which Spinoza's position resembles Hobbes's. Just as Hobbes thinks that pleasure and pain are motivational, such that pleasure itself  is an appetite and pain an aversion, Spinoza thinks that modes that constitute joy and sadness are motivational, with the distinction between emotions like joy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## STRIVING, HAppINESS, ANd THE Good: SpINozA AS FolloWER ANd CRITIC oF HoBBES\n\nand sadness and desires being merely aspectual. For Spinoza, as for Hobbes, there is no gap between how we are affected and how we are determined to act.\n\nFinally, to get the comparison with Hobbes in full view, let us consider how evaluative judgments fit into this account of motivation. Having rejected the Scholastic view that good and evil are features of  the  world  that  compel  our  will,  Spinoza  embraces  the Hobbesian view that judgments of the good are grounded in our desires: '[W]e neither strive for, nor will, neither want, nor desire anything because we judge it to be good; on the contrary, we judge something to be good because we strive for it, will it, want it, and desire it'  (3p9s [1985, 500]; cf. 3p39s [1985, 516-17]). The specific nature of the dependency  relationship  between  evaluative  judgments  and  desire  is  fleshed  out  in Ethics 4, where Spinoza maintains that that the ideas of good and evil are nothing but affects themselves (4p8 [1985, 550]; 4p19d [1985, 556-7]). 12 like Hobbes, Spinoza denies that judgments of good and evil play any independent explanatory role in human motivation, treating them instead as motivational just insofar as they are affects.\n\nWe see from this that Spinoza and Hobbes advance remarkably similar accounts of motivation. They both reject free will and the traditional conception of final causes and along with it the explanatory independence of evaluative judgments. Instead, they offer mechanistic  accounts  according  to  which:  we  strive  to  persevere  in  our  being;  joy/ pleasure and sadness/pain are responses to how one's vital functioning is impacted; these basic affective states are also motivational; evaluative appraisals are constituted by affects or desires.\n\nIn light of  how similar their views are, it seems fair to conclude that Spinoza, an eager and astute reader of Hobbes, was strongly influenced by his predecessor in developing his account of moral motivation. But while Spinoza and Hobbes adopt similar motivational frameworks on which they base their moral and civil philosophies, they nevertheless arrive at fundamentally different normative conclusions. In this next section, I will explore one notable difference in their accounts of motivation, a difference that is the wedge that drives their views apart.\n\n## Striving and Essence\n\nThe crucial difference between Hobbes and Spinoza concerns the role that essences play in  their  respective  conceptions  of   striving.  put  simply ,  Spinoza  is  committed  to  the explanatory significance of essences, whereas Hobbes is not.\n\n## Spinoza on Striving and Essence\n\nEssences figure into Spinoza's account of striving in a couple of ways. on the one hand, Spinoza claims that striving is 'the actual essence of the thing' (3p7; 1985, 499). It is what one does and cannot but do. As one's essential activity, striving not only generates, but informs, particular desires. In other words, all desires in some sense express, or inherit the very character of, that essential tendency . 13\n\nMoreover, it has plausibly been argued that to strive is to realize one's essence as far as possible. 14 Although striving to 'persevere in its being [ in suo esse ]' (3p6; 1985, 498)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## JUSTIN STEINBERG\n\nis sometimes glossed as a principle of mere existential inertia, in fact such a reading jars with other claims in the Ethics . 15 Just as existence should not be measured in terms of persistence over time (2p45s [1985, 482]; 1d8 exp [1985, 409]), neither should striving. Rather, striving is the tendency to increase one's power or perfection, both of which are to be understood in terms of one's essence or nature:\n\nBy virtue and power I understand the same thing, that is (by IIIp7), virtue, insofar as it is related to man, is the very essence, or nature of man, insofar as he has the power of bring about certain things, which can be understood through the laws of his nature alone. (4d8; 1985, 547)\n\n[W]e understand by perfection the very essence of the thing. (3 GdA; 1985, 542-3)\n\n[B]y perfection in general I shall, as I have said, understand reality, that is, the essence of each thing insofar as it exists and produces an effect, having no regard to its duration. (4 preface; 1985, 546)\n\nIn light of this understanding of power and perfection, we see that striving to increase one's power or perfection is tantamount to striving to realize one's essence more completely . 16\n\n## Hobbes on Striving and Essence\n\nSpinoza's essentialist  account  stands  in  sharp  contrast  to  Hobbes's  view  of   striving. Hobbes  is  generally  skeptical  about  the  explanatory  role  of   essences  or  natures.  In Elements of  Law , he reduces a thing's nature to its powers, rather than treating it as the ground of powers (EW IV .2). And in Leviathan , he rails against Aristotelian real essences, claiming that 'an essence, therefore, is not a thing, either created or uncreated; it is, rather, a name invented for the sake of their craft. It is only Aristotle who has given birth to  new,  bastard  and  empty beings of   this  kind'  (2012,  1079;  1651,  320  -  Curley's translation; cf. 2012, 80; 1651, 24; 2012, 1076-82; 1651, 371-3). By denying real (irreducible) essences, Hobbes also eschews the view of striving as one's essential activity . So, while one's vital motions figure into the generation of voluntary motions, it is not  the  case  that  appetites  and  aversions  are  conceptually  tied  to  self-preservation (more below); nor can this vital activity be conceptualized as 'essence realizing.' put simply, essences play no role in Hobbes's account of motivation.\n\nTo be sure, Hobbes does invoke the notion of a human nature . However, this conception of  nature does not delimit one's range of activity in the way that it does for Spinoza. As S. A. lloyd and Susanne Sreedhar have stressed for Hobbes, the mere fact that an impulse or desire arises from one's nature does not make it effective. So, for instance, while the aversion to death may be in us by nature, such that in the absence of other impulses we will tend to preserve ourselves, humans commonly 'create   countervailing forces to thwart the effectiveness of  their natural impulses' (lloyd 2009, 63). 17 Bernard Gert also argues that we must distinguish between what 'human beings naturally avoid and what actual human beings (those who have been subject to education and training,  good  or  bad)  avoid'  (Gert  2010,  45).  on  such  readings,  one's  nature  may  be roughly understood as something like one's biological nature. But, as lloyd puts it, we are  'as  much  creatures  of  our  cultural  nurture  as  we  are  of   our  abstract  nature'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSTRIVING, HAppINESS, ANd THE Good: SpINozA AS FolloWER ANd CRITIC oF HoBBES\n\n(2009, 66). Indeed, according to Hobbes, in order to live in peace, humans must in some  sense  transcend  or  overcome  our  nature,  which  would  not  be  possible  on  an essentialist reading.\n\nFrom the preceding analysis, we see that while Hobbes and Spinoza both accord to striving a pride of  place in their theories of  motivation, they conceive of the character and role of striving quite differently . Most notably, Spinoza regards striving as tied to a metaphysics of essences, while Hobbes does not.\n\nThis entails that, for Spinoza, while we can desire all sorts of particular things namely, anything that we represent as the object of joy - these ends are always expressive  of   our  striving  to  persevere  in  our  being.  We  might  distinguish  between  the superficial  and  the  deep  content  of   desires.  The  superficial  content  -  or  immediate object - of  desire is always conditioned and underwritten by the deep content of striving to persevere in one's being. 18 Because the striving to persevere does not merely generate desires, but is expressed in all desires, Spinoza can only offer a rather tortured analysis of   suicide,  claiming that apparently voluntary acts of self-destruction are really just instances of destruction by 'hidden external causes' (4p20s [1985, 557]; cf. 4p18s [1985, 556]).\n\nBy contrast, Hobbes has no such difficulty accounting for suicidal and self-sacrificial behavior (2012, 116; 1651, 37; see also EW VI.281; 1972, 48-9). While we have a natural aversion to death, this aversion can be overridden by stronger passions that we cultivate (EW II.82-3). The fact that a desire or aversion is natural does not mean that it occupies a privileged status in Hobbes's motivational scheme; and it certainly does not mean that all other motives reflect this impulse. For Hobbes, the reasons for which we intentionally or voluntarily act - that is, the aspect or description under which we act need not appeal to one's striving: one can act for love, glory, charity, salvation, fear of damnation, or any other number of other ends, even at the cost of bodily preservation. So,  despite  his  popular  reputation  as  a  psychological  egoist,  Hobbes  was  a  pluralist about motivation. It is Spinoza, not Hobbes, who is something of a motivational monist, at least in the limited sense that he is committed to the view that desires are always ultimately expressive of striving to realize one's essence. 19\n\nIn the next section we will begin to explore the ethical and political implications of Hobbes's  and  Spinoza's  distinct  views  of   motivation  by  examining  the  relationship between their respective views of striving and their accounts of action and artifice. We will see that while Hobbes will have no truck with real essences, Spinoza will have no truck with the notion of overcoming one's nature or creating a realm of artifice.\n\n## Action, Artifice, and Civil life\n\nAs noted above, Hobbes thinks that we construct selves beyond our natures. To see how, we must examine Hobbes's views of activity and artifice, which turn on his conception of  language. As philip pettit puts it: 'language, in Hobbes's story, provides the magic that enables us to jump the limitations of the natural, animal mind' (2008, 25). Hobbes conceives of speech as a kind of technology, calling it 'the most noble and profitable invention' (2012, 48; 1651, 13) and claiming that on its basis our faculties 'may be improved to such a height, as to distinguish men from all other living creatures' (2012,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## JUSTIN STEINBERG\n\n48; 1651, 11. cf. EW IV .25). language augments cognition, facilitates the exercise of deliberative control and agency, and enables us to create social realities through the declaration of will. 20\n\nSpinoza adopts a fundamentally different conception of action and agency, one that is  rooted,  unsurprisingly ,  in  his  conception  of   essence.  Action,  for  Spinoza,  does  not require transcending one's nature; indeed, it is precisely a matter of producing effects from one's nature. Spinoza spells this out in the very beginning of Ethics 3, where he claims that we act when we are the adequate cause of something, that is, when we produce effects that are explicable through our nature alone (3d1-3d2). By contrast, we are  passive  when  we  produce  effects  only  in  conjunction  with  the  natures  of   other things. one exercises one's agency not, per impossible , by transcending one's nature, 21 but precisely by bringing it about that one's nature is more efficacious.\n\nHobbes's and Spinoza's distinct views of action and activity figure directly into their respective analyses of civic life. For Hobbes, speech enables us to construct new social realities, most notably the commonwealth. 22 The artificiality of  the state is so prominent in Hobbes's account that I needn't belabor this point. I note it simply to set up the contrast with Spinoza, who, when prompted by his friend Jarig Jelles to explain how his view differs from Hobbes's, responded: ' As far as politics is concerned, the difference you ask about, between Hobbes and me, is this: I always preserve natural Right unimpaired and I maintain that in each State the Supreme Magistrate has no more right over its subjects than it has greater power over them' (Ep. 50; 2015, 206). For Spinoza, right is coextensive with power, which, as one's very essence , is not something from which one can be alienated or which one can transfer like a piece of property . So, whereas Hobbes thinks that authority is constructed through the transfer of right or declaration of will, Spinoza thinks that authority is a fully natural ( de facto ) condition that is established only insofar as dependency relations obtain (Tp 2/10 [2015, 512]; TTp 17.5-6 [2015, 512]). 23 This point of contrast between Spinoza and Hobbes is rooted in their distinct views of one's nature or essence: for Hobbes, one's nature is merely the starting point of human life, whereas for Spinoza one's nature is one's inalienable power that defines all that one is and does.\n\nThese different conceptions of right yield correspondingly distinct views of obligation. For Hobbes, transferring right through declaring one's will entails incurring obligation, so that to violate a covenant is to have conflicting wills, or to contradict oneself (EW IV .96). By contrast, Spinoza denies that contracts oblige independent of perceived utility (TTp 16.20 [2015, 512]; TTp 16.9 [2015, 512]; Tp 2/12 [2015, 512-13]). This follows from his view that right is coextensive with power: being obligated entails lacking the right to something; but anything one can do - including breaking pledges - one does by right (Tp 2/12; 2015, 512-13). like authority, obligation is a de facto condition: it consists in actually being held to something, which in the case of contracts or promises is a matter of  remaining motivated to comply with them. 24\n\non  the  basis  of   their  distinct  understandings  of   right,  authority ,  and  obligation, Hobbes and Spinoza adopt very different views about how the commonwealth should be structured and what sovereign absolutism entails. 25 But rather than lingering on these juridical differences, I want to turn in this final section to a set of concepts that have received comparatively less attention as a point of contrast, namely, their respective conceptions of goodness and happiness.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## STRIVING, HAppINESS, ANd THE Good: SpINozA AS FolloWER ANd CRITIC oF HoBBES\n\n## Striving, Happiness, and the Good\n\nHobbes and Spinoza both claim that the concepts of good and evil depend on the motivational states of  the agent. But, as we will see in this section, their distinct views about motivation yield different views of value (e.g., good and evil) and happiness.\n\n## Hobbes on Happiness and the Good\n\nWe saw in the first section that Hobbes thinks that the concepts of good and evil refer to our affective responses to things rather than to mind-independent properties. We call things good insofar as they please us and we desire them, and we call things evil insofar as they displease us and we are averse to them. This is not just a point about we happen to use language, it is a claim about the very meaning of the concepts of good and evil: they are terms we ascribe to things based on how they affect us - things that delight us or impel us are good, while things that displease us or repel us are bad. In presenting good and evil as affect-dependent concepts, Hobbes calls attention to their variability . Not only are there differences between individuals in their axiological appraisals, but the very same individual may adopt different evaluative stances at different times in relation to one and the same thing (see e.g., 2012, 242; 1651, 80). The instability of evaluative standards contributes to disputes and antagonisms. The remedy, of course, is to establish a public standard of good and evil in the form of a sovereign or authorized legislator (see 2012, 1090; 1651, 376).\n\nBy establishing a common standard of right, wrong, good, and evil, the commonwealth functions to reduce conflict, while providing the security that everyone desires. The state is thus the 'the greatest of human powers' (2012, 132; 1651, 41), powers being means for obtaining other goods or desires (2012, 132; 1651, 41). other powers include friendship, riches, wisdom, the arts and sciences, and honor (1972, 47-51; EW IV .37-8; Leviathan chapter 10). Such things are useful irrespective of one's particular intrinsic ends and may consequently be regarded as common goods in Hobbes's sense (1972, 47). The fact that there are common goods and that the state supplies a public standard of good and evil might lead us to think that Hobbes has a desire-independent conception of good. In fact, though, Hobbes insists that 'whatever is good, is good for someone or other' (1972, 47; EW V .193) and that public standard of the civil law and the goodness of powers are parasitic on the intrinsic desires of individuals. Consequently, nothing in Hobbes's account of the public standard or of common goods implies a disavowal of his desire-dependent conception of the good.\n\nNevertheless, not everything that one desires is good. Hobbes is keen to distinguish real from apparent goods (1972, 48; EW IV .25), claiming that one can desire something the obtainment of which would actually be, on balance, bad for the agent. For instance, he claims that emotions 'militate against the real good, and in favor of the apparent and most immediate good, which turns out frequently to be evil when everything associated with it hath been considered' (1972, 55). one might wonder how Hobbes, who rejects any conception of proper functioning, can distinguish desires that aim at 'real goods' from those that do not. The answer is that, unlike merely apparent goods, real goods are things that one pursues insofar as one is rational, in the sense of properly\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## JUSTIN STEINBERG\n\nreckoning long-term consequences (1972, 48; cf. EW IV .34). Emotions 'obstruct right reasoning' because they prompt one to pursue lesser proximate goods without regard to long-term consequences (1972, 55; cf. EW II.47-8; 2012, 282; 1651, 94). This is consistent with the good being desire-dependent, since what counts as a real good ultimately depends on what one desires, or what one would desire if one were adequately informed. Nothing in the account presupposes the existence of substantive, desire-independent ends.\n\nJust as real goods vary from person to person, so does felicity or happiness. Felicity is defined in explicitly desire-dependent terms as: 'continuall successe in obtaining those things which a man from time to time desireth' (2012, 96; 1651, 29). This is one way in which Hobbes sets his account of felicity apart from the eudaimonist tradition:  he  denies  that  it  consists  in  something  like  proper  human  functioning, claiming  instead  that  what  makes  one  happy  varies  according  to  one's  desires (2012, 150; 1651, 47). 26 Another way that Hobbes breaks from classical eudaimonism is in  his  denial  that  happiness  consists  in  perfecting  of   one's  capacities, whether intellectual or moral. 27 And whereas, on a classical conception, to perfect one's  capacities  is,  in  a  sense,  to  acquire  all  that  one  lacks,  Hobbes  emphatically insists  that  because  human desires are never fully satiated, happiness consists in prospering ,  not  having  prospered  (2012,  150;  1651,  47;  see  also  1972,  53).  We should not, therefore, take happiness to be the contentment that arises from selfperfection: 'the felicity of  this life consisteth not in the repose of  the mind satisfied. For there is no such Finis ultimus (utmost aim) nor Summum Bonum (greatest good)' (2012, 150; 1651, 47).\n\nlet  me  conclude  by  noting  a  couple  of   significant  consequences  of   Hobbes's desire-dependent conceptions of goodness and felicity. First of  all, it limits the moral ambitions of the state. To be sure, the sovereign is enjoined to govern so as to promote  peace,  preservation,  and  the  'commodious  life'  of   citizens.  However,  as Bernard Gert puts it, the 'positive goal' of  promoting felicity 'has no specific content' (2010, 50), since it depends on desires. So, while Hobbes advocates the establishment of  a rather robust conception of  safety that facilitates the procurement of 'all other contentments of  life, which every man by lawful industry, without danger or hurt to the commonwealth, shall acquire to himself' (2012, 520; 1651, 175; cf. 2012, 196; 1651, 63; EW II.167-8), he acknowledges that such contentments will vary  from  person  to  person.  Consequently,  although  Hobbes  does  think  that  the state can and should seek to supply the means for contentment or commodious living, it remains the case that individuals retain their own particular sets of  desires and conceptions of the good and felicitous life, the obtainment of  which lies somewhat beyond the ambit of state power. 28\n\nMoreover, since Hobbes rejects appeals to essences or proper functioning, he also abjures  the  ideal  of   positive  liberty  as  self-realization.  Instead,  in Leviathan 21  he famously  conceives  of   liberty  in  terms  of   the  absence  of   physical  or  'artificial' impediments, rendering one free to the extent that one is not prevented from doing what one wills. His novel 'negative' conception of liberty is to some extent an outgrowth of his desire-relative conception of  goodness and his corresponding rejection of  perfectionism.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSTRIVING, HAppINESS, ANd THE Good: SpINozA AS FolloWER ANd CRITIC oF HoBBES\n\n## Spinoza on Happiness and the Good\n\nThe contrast with Spinoza on goodness, happiness, liberty, and the aims of the state could  hardly  be  starker.  For  Spinoza,  while  goodness  is,  in  some  sense,  motivationdependent, the relevant motivation here is one's essential, invariant striving. This serves as a fixed standard of evaluation: things really are good or evil relative to how they impact one's striving or essence.\n\nSpinoza advances his revisionist accounts of good and evil in Ethics 4, where, after again denying that predicates like good, evil, imperfect, and imperfect are intrinsic properties of  things, he proposes that we understand good and evil in terms of how things affect one's essence or power of acting (4p8d; 1985, 550). Things are good insofar as they increase one's power or aid one in realizing one's power and are evil insofar as the diminish one's power or prevent one from realizing one's power. This fits with the other prominent way in which Spinoza construes the concepts of good and evil,  namely,  in  terms  of   whether  something  brings  one  closer  to,  or  renders  one further  from,  the  'model  of   human  nature'  (4  preface;  1985,  545) The  model  of human nature is a paradigm of human power or 'reality' - that is, it is a model of a fully realized human essence.\n\nSo,  while  Spinoza's  conception  of   the  good  is  motivation-dependent,  it  is in  some sense mind-independent, in that it does not hinge on one's perceptions or on the superficial content of  one's desires. Things really are good insofar as they conduce to essence realization, even if  they are not overtly pursued or represented as good. put somewhat differently ,  Spinoza  thinks  that  while  some  ways  of   striving  are  fully  one's  own,  or authentic, there are also ways of striving that reflect the influence of external natures.\n\nWe can elucidate this point via the distinction between action and passion. We will recall from the previous section that, according to Spinoza, one acts in the strict sense when and only when one is the adequate cause of something. In Ethics 4, Spinoza casts this  notion  in  a  few  interchangeable  ways.  For  instance,  he  defines  virtue  as  one's essence or power of bringing about effects from one's nature (4d8; 1985, 547), from which he infers that to act from virtue is to act from the laws of one's nature, or to act in the strict sense (4p24d; 1985, 558). Moreover, having previously argued that one acts in the strict sense when and only when one has adequate ideas (3p1, 3p3; 1985, 493, 497), he claims that one acts from the laws of one's own nature - or, acts in the strict sense - when one is guided by reason: 'acting from reason is nothing else but to do what follows from the necessity of our own nature considered solely in itself' (4p59d [1985, 579]; cf. 4p24 [1985, 558]; 4p35d/c1 [1985, 563]; 4p37s1 [1985, 565-6]; 4p52 [1985, 575]). 29 To  strive  from reason, or to act from rational desires, is to act authentically, from desires that spring from one's nature, which he groups under the rubric  'strength  of   character'  [ fortitudo ]  (3p59s;  1985,  529).  By  contrast,  to  strive from passions or confused ideas, is to be 'guided by things outside [oneself]' and to be 'determined by them to do what the common constitution of external things demands, not what his own nature, considered in itself, demands' (4p37s1; 1985, 565-6).\n\non the basis of this analysis, we see that while Spinoza and Hobbes agree that things are really good insofar as they satisfy rational desires, this resemblance cloaks a much deeper  division.  Hobbes  operates  with  a  functional  distinction  between  reason  and desire, taking reason to be a cognitive ability that, among other things, enables us to\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## JUSTIN STEINBERG\n\ncalculate consequences so as to satisfy our desires, whatever they happen to be. By contrast, Spinoza regards acting from reason as simply acting from the laws of one's nature, or  acting  authentically,  which  consists  in  forming  adequate  ideas  that  beget  further adequate ideas, producing effects that are intelligible through one's nature alone (see Rutherford 2008). Rational desires follow from one's nature alone and enable one to further  realize  this  very  nature.  So,  while  Hobbes  and  Spinoza  agree  that  what  we rationally desire is really good, for Hobbes this is because reason helps us to satisfy our variable desires, whereas for Spinoza this is because acting from reason is just acting from, and more fully realizing, one's essence.\n\nWe find a corresponding contrast in their views on happiness. While Hobbes conceives felicity in terms of  desire-satisfaction, forsaking any appeal to proper functioning, Spinoza advances a view that is far more congenial to the eudaimonist tradition. He construes 'happiness' [ felicitas ]  as  successful  striving  (4p18s; 1985, 556), asserting that 'if  we pass the whole length of our life with a sound mind in a sound body, that is considered  happiness'  (5p39s;  1985,  614).  Happiness  is  a  kind  of  flourishing  that comes from the exercise of virtue (2p49s; 4p20s [1985, 557]), that is, the realization of one's  essence.  And  one's  'highest  happiness,'  or  blessedness,  consists  in  perfecting one's intellect and coming to know and love God (4 App. Cap IV [1985, 588]; 5p36s [1985, 612-13]; TTp 3.2 [2015, 111]), resulting in a form of reflective self-contentment or 'satisfaction of mind' [ acquiescentia mentis ] (4 App. Cap IV [1985, 588]; 5p27 [1985, 609]; 5p32 [1985, 611]; 5p36s [1985, 612-13]). Not only, then, does Spinoza conceive happiness as flourishing or the realization of one's essence, he also represents the affective condition that results from self-realization in terms of something like the very mental repose that Hobbes declared unachievable.\n\nUnlike Hobbes, Spinoza also connects happiness with doing good for others, treating 'nobility' [ generositas ], or the desire 'to aid other men and join them to him in friendship,' as one family of rational desire (3p59s; 1985, 529-30). 30 Indeed, he maintains that 'men who are governed by reason … want nothing for themselves that they do not desire for other men. Hence, they are just, honest, and honorable' (4p18s; 1985, 556; cf. 4p37; 1985, 559). Underwriting the rational pursuit of others' power is, once again, Spinoza's essentialism. Because humans agree in their nature, 31 one who acts from reason, or from the laws of our nature, will strive for, and rejoice in, the realization of  our common nature: 'Man, I say, can wish for nothing more helpful to the preservation of his being than that … that all should strive together, as far as they can, to preserve their being; and that all, together, should seek for themselves the common advantage of all' (4p18s). leaving aside the reasoning in support of this view, we may note that the resulting picture is that there are goods that are common not merely in the weak sense of  being rational for each person to desire, but in the much stronger sense that their promotion is directly beneficial to all. Knowledge or understanding in particular is 'a good that is common to all men, and can be possessed by all' (4p36d; 1985,564), and so insofar as one is rational one will promote the understanding of all humans, and in so doing more fully realize one's own essence (4p37d; 1985,559). 32\n\nSpinoza's account of happiness and the agreement of essences profoundly shapes his view of the function of the state. In the Political Treatise , he claims that the purpose of  the state is peace, explicating peace in a way that is plainly critical of  Hobbes's construal of  peace as the absence of war (2012, 192; 1651, 62; see also EW II.11):\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## STRIVING, HAppINESS, ANd THE Good: SpINozA AS FolloWER ANd CRITIC oF HoBBES\n\npeace isn't the privation of war, but a virtue that arises from strength of mind [ animi fortitudine ] … the best state is one where men pass their lives harmoniously, I mean that they pass a human life, one defined not merely by the circulation of the blood, and other things common to all animals, but mostly by reason, the true virtue and life of the Mind…peace does not consist in the privation of war, but in a union or harmony of minds. (Tp 5/4-5/5 [2015, 530]; Tp 6/4 [2015, 533])\n\nWhile Hobbes thinks that the state fosters conditions in which individuals can pursue their own individual happiness, Spinoza regards it as the aim of the state to cultivate reason, and to bring about a 'harmony of minds,' which would directly contribute to human happiness.\n\nHis account of the purpose of the state in TTp is at least as robust: 'The end of the Republic, I say, is not to change men from rational beings into beasts or automata, but to enable their minds and bodies to perform their functions safely, to enable them to use their  reason  freely  …  So  the  end  of   the  Republic  is  really  freedom'  (TTp  20.11-12 [2015, 346]). Freedom, for Spinoza, consists in the ability to act and exist from the necessity of one's own nature (1d8 [1985, 409]; Ep. 58 [2015, 427-30]). And, while God alone is fully free, since no finite thing exists from its own nature, human beings are free to the extent that we are able to act from reason, or from our nature alone. The freedom that he promotes in the politics is this very liberty of acting or essence realization: 'I call a man completely free just insofar as he is guided by reason, because to that extent  he  is  determined  to  action  by  causes  which  can  be  understood  adequately through his own nature alone' (Tp 2/11 [2015, 512]; cf. Tp 2/7 [2015, 510]; Tp 3/63/7 [2015, 519-20]). So, while Hobbes conceives of political liberty as the absence of impediments, Spinoza adopts a positive conception of liberty as self-realization, or acting from one's essence alone, and he maintains that it is the function of the state to promote this positive good as far as possible.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nHobbes's  influence  on  Spinoza's  conception  of  motivation  is  unmistakable  and  profound. But while both Hobbes and Spinoza see goodness as in some sense motivationdependent, Hobbes takes this to imply that goodness and the content of one's happiness depend on the variable content of one's desires, Spinoza regards the motivational tendency on which goodness depends as one's essential striving for self-realization, providing a firm standard for evaluating goodness and happiness.\n\non Spinoza's account, things that aid one's essence or power really are good, while things that inhibit it really are evil, irrespective of  how they related to the superficial content  of  one's  desires,  which  only  masks  one's  deep,  essential  striving  for  power. Rational desires are authentic, following from one's essence or striving alone, while passions are not. And insofar as we act from these authentic, rational desires, we will not only act in ways that are empowering to ourselves, but also in ways that are empowering to other human beings, who agree with us in nature. The more one is able to develop one's own mind and to promote human understanding more generally, the more one will have realized one's essence, and the happier one will be.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## JUSTIN STEINBERG\n\non the basis of all of this, one sees that Spinoza's normative ethical philosophy has considerably more in common with traditional eudaimonism Hobbes's does. Ultimately, Spinoza builds a modern form of eudaimonism on the basis of a mechanistic moral psychology that is deeply indebted to Hobbes. like Hobbes, he rejects the intrinsic reality of  evaluative predicates and the irreducible efficacy of  final causes. But he insists on the explanatory power of non-teleological essences, 33 which anchor a conception of goodness and flourishing that, while in some sense mind-independent, remains firmly motivation-dependent.\n\n## Acknowledgment\n\nThanks to Marcus Adams and Karolina Hübner for very helpful comments on an earlier draft.\n\n## Notes\n\n- 1 Curley (1988); Jesseph (2016); Malinowski-Charles (2017).\n- 2 See Curley (1992); Malcolm (2002); Wernham (1958).\n- 3 Aquinas, Opera omnia , xvi. 340 (cited in Carriero 2005).\n- 4 For a characteristic account of the explanatory role of goodness, see Suarez Metaphysical Disputations ,  disputation 23, Section 5, §15, opera vol. 25, 867, in Suarez (1856-1870) (cited in pink 2018, 7).\n- 5 See pink (2018); Sleigh, Chappell, and Rocca (1998, 1197-1198); Stump (2005), 22.\n- 6 Cf.

It fails to make sense of his claim that the foundation of virtue is 'striving to preserve one's being' (4p18s [1985, 555-6]; 4p22 [1985, 558]) and 'the striving  for  understanding'  (4p26d;  1985,  559),  since  understanding  goes  well  beyond\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## STRIVING, HAppINESS, ANd THE Good: SpINozA AS FolloWER ANd CRITIC oF HoBBES\n\nmerely enduring. And it cannot easily be squared with the claim that the free man avoids deception even on pain of death (4p72s; 1985, 587). For a helpful discussion, see Youpa (2003).\n\n- 16 one might worry that the claim that one's essence consists in striving to realize one's essence is  circular.While  a  full  response  to  this  worry  would  require  entering  the  deep  waters  of Spinoza's metaphysics, I will simply indicate why I don't think that this is a problem. Striving is one's actual essence. However, Spinoza allows for another way of thinking of essences sometimes flagged as one's formal essence - which is something more like a thing's blueprint, an eternal description or structure from which certain properties or effects necessarily follow (2p8/c [1985, 452]; 5p22 [1985, 607]; 5p23/d [1985, 607]; 5p29/d [1985, 609-10]; see Garrett 2018b). one's striving or actual essence consists in tending to realize this (formal) essence and all that follows from it as far as possible.\n- 17 Cf. Sreedhar (2010, 36).\n- 18 This may be one respect in which Spinoza's psychology anticipates Freudian psychotherapy (see Neu 1977).\n- 19 This is not to say that he is an egoist, since he thinks that striving to persevere in one's being entails striving to aid others (discussed in the final section).\n- 20 Recent scholarship has emphasized the ways in which speech facilitates human agency. For instance,  laurens  van  Apeldoorn has pushed back against the view that Hobbes has an impoverished view of agency, claiming that, for Hobbes, language enables us to order our thoughts, record past experiences, draw inferences on the basis of general rules, and make informed,  careful  judgments  about  consequences,  thereby  exercising  deliberative  control (Van Apeldoorn 2012, 2014). Arash Abizadeh advances a similar view, according to which language  transforms  reasoning  such  that  our  deliberation  may  be  at  once  'active'  and 'strongly cognitive' (Abizadeh 2017).\n- 21 And certainly not though the exercise of language, which Spinoza relegates to the lowest kind of cognition (2p40s2; 1985, 477-8).\n- 22 Without  speech,  there  is  'neither  commonwealth,  nor  society,  nor  contract,  nor  peace' (2012, 48; 1651, 12).\n- 23 For a full defense of  this claim, see Steinberg (2018a). For readings of Hobbes that bring his view closer to Spinoza's, see Field (2014); Hoekstra (2004).\n- 24 For a more complete, and more nuanced, analysis of these points, see Steinberg (2018a, ch. 2).\n- 25 Steinberg (2018b).\n- 26 See Gert (2010, 51); Hamilton (2016, 142).\n- 27 on the severance of happiness and moral virtue, see Hamilton (2016, 146); Rutherford (2003, 380).\n- 28 Again, this is not to deny that Hobbes thinks that the state ought to do more than establish basic physical security . For a discussion of  the political significance of  felicity , see Rutherford (2003).  I  find  Rutherford's  analysis  generally  compelling,  though  I  think  that  Hobbes's break with eudaimonism is sharper than Rutherford does.\n- 29 While Spinoza initially introduces reason [ ratio ] as comprising a subset of adequate ideas, namely, those formed from 'common notion and adequate ideas of the properties of things' (2p40s2), in Ethics 4 he seems to operate with a more expansive conception of reason, comprising all adequate ideas (4p26d [1985, 559]; 4p37s1 [1985, 565-6]; 4p52 [1985, 575]).\n- 30 See Curley (1994), xxxii on this point of distinction.\n- 31 For accounts of how to square this with his nominalism, see Hübner (2016); Steinberg (1984).\n- 32 For some analysis of the problems with the reasoning here, and how they might be overcome, See della Rocca (2004); Steinberg (1984); Steinberg (2019).\n- 33 For good discussions of this point, see Carriero (2005); Viljanen (2011).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJUSTIN STEINBERG\n\n## Works Cited\n\n| Abizadeh, Arash. 2017.
