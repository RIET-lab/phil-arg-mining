The premises should logically entail the conclusion.\n2. **Claim**: A proposition that asserts something to be true or false, typically requiring justification or evidence.\n3. **Premise**: A proposition that provides evidence, justification, or logical support for a claim or conclusion.\n\n## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS\n1. **VERBATIM EXTRACTION ONLY**: Each ADU text must be copied EXACTLY from the paper with no modifications, paraphrasing, or combining of separate sentences.\n2. **NO HALLUCINATION**: Do not create, modify, or invent text that does not appear exactly in the source.\n3. **EXACT MATCHING**: Every word, punctuation mark, and spacing must match the original precisely.\n\n## DIRECTIONS\n1. **Identify Argumentative Discourse Units (ADUs)**  \n   - ADU = any contiguous text span functioning as a claim or a premise in the reasoning structure.\n   - **BE HIGHLY SELECTIVE**: Only include ADUs that are crucial to the overarching argument structure.\n   - Focus on significant claims and premises that contribute meaningfully to the argumentative flow.\n   - **AVOID NOISE**: Skip ADUs that are merely descriptive, tangential, or do not substantially advance the argument.\n   - Prioritize quality over quantity - fewer accurate, important ADUs are better than many insignificant ones.\n   - **EXTRACT ONLY**: Copy text spans exactly as they appear, without any modifications.\n2. **Classify each ADU**  \n   - Label = either `\"claim\"` or `\"premise\"`.  \n3. **Detect directed relations**  \n   - Relation = `\"support\"` or `\"attack\"`, from one ADU (source) to another (target).\n   - Map how ADUs connect to form reasoning chains.\n   - Focus on relationships between the most significant ADUs.\n   - Include relationships between premises that strengthen or weaken each other.\n4. **Verbatim spans**  \n   - Each `\"text\"` value must be copied EXACTLY from the paper with zero modifications.\n   - Do not paraphrase, summarize, or combine separate sentences.\n   - Do not add, remove, or change any words, punctuation, or spacing.\n   - If unsure about exact wording, skip that ADU rather than guess.\n\n## WHAT TO CAPTURE\n**INCLUDE ONLY:**\n- Main argumentative threads that are central to the paper's contribution\n- Core claims that represent the paper's primary arguments or findings\n- Key premises that provide essential support for major claims\n- Critical counterarguments and their refutations\n- Reasoning chains that demonstrate how main conclusions are derived\n\n**EXCLUDE (AVOID NOISE):**\n- Minor details, examples, or descriptive content that don't advance the argument\n- Tangential points or side discussions\n- Pure background information or literature review content\n- Methodological details unless they constitute argumentative claims\n- Obvious statements or commonly accepted facts\n- Redundant or repetitive argumentative content\n\n**GUIDING PRINCIPLE**: If removing an ADU would not significantly impact understanding of the paper's argumentative structure, it should be excluded.\n\n## QUALITY CONTROL\n- Before finalizing each ADU, verify the text exists exactly in the source\n- Prefer fewer, accurate ADUs over many potentially modified ones\n- When in doubt about exact wording, omit the ADU\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\nReturn **only** a single valid JSON object matching this schema.  \nDo **not** output any extra text, markdown, or explanations.\nDo **not** add comments.\n**RESPOND WITH ONLY**:\n```json\n{\n  \"ADUs\": {\n    \"<ADU_ID>\": {\n      \"text\": \"<exact span from paper>\",\n      \"label\": \"claim\" | \"premise\"\n    }\n    ...\n  },\n  \"relations\": [\n    {\n      \"source\": \"<ADU_ID>\",\n      \"target\": \"<ADU_ID>\",\n      \"type\": \"support\" | \"attack\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

All the more harsh is it for those who worked within the framework imposed upon professional philosophy by the official ideology. Here in this book, we are concerned with some 31 colleagues from the late German Democratic Republic, representative in their scholarship of the achievements of a curiously creative while dismayingly repressive period.\n\nIn view of this devastation, how can we dare to present a serious book containing the work of Marxist philosophers of science, historians of science, and advocates of sciences studies in their sociological, psychological and policy aspects? Are these contributions not the plainly contaminated, ideologically distorted, works of the very establishment types who are Abgewickelt, that is (may we say it) deconstructed in 1991? being\n\nThe literature published in the GDR was blossoming, certainly in the final decade, but it developed within a totalitarian regime where personal careers   either   advanced or faltered   through the private   protection Or denunciation of mentors.  We will never know how many minds did not enter the field of philosophy in the first place due to their prudent judgments that there was a virtual requirement that the candidate join the Socialist Unity (i.e. Communist) Party. Among those who started careers and were sidetracked, the record is now beginning to be revealed; and for the rest, the of philosophy was mostly silence in the face of harassments the likes of which make academic politics in the West seem child's play. good doing price\n\nWe North Americans might say that ours was an ethnographic study. during June 17th to July 6th, 1988.

Further, were often taken OUI graduate students, not professors, often dominated discussions.

Yet we invite you to take seriously the evidence gathered here of how some actually went about scholarship within a totalitarian regime. Would we have acted differently?  Professor Woodward's Introduction suggests how younger scholars were harassed from within. This the East Germans could understand. What now occurs at the hands of their West German colleagues is more complicated.  After a decade (or much more for older scholars) in their  careers due to deficient   education, unaffordable or forbidden professional literature, and political intrigue, most scholars now face total invalidation; and the formal loss of their jobs, through that anonymous way of 'deconstruction (Abwicklung) of entire departments. may, it is true, compete for their positions in the open market; but to an external observer it seems that a harsh and drastic changing of the guard is underway.

By translating this material from a crOSS section of both younger and older scholars, our intent was to demonstrate what we surmised would be a lively field of study on both sides of that rusty Iron Curtain: I thought; too, that the liberalization of scholarship in the GDR was really coming to pass; slowly but markedly, within Marxist language but also through the conceptual languages of other world-views. We could not guess that we were providing the final, lively, platform for an academic culture before its society was overtaken by the West, and with the realistic acquiescence of Moscow. they\n\nBut now to our book, to be judged for its science, its historical and philosophical scholarship, for the cogency of interpretations.

To understand one another means first to know better the differences in operative styles, in cognitive and methodological standpoints. Communication   presupposes   the clearest   possible knowledge of differences that might arise where these cannot be brought into agreement, mutual understanding and acceptance of the opinion of the other while emphasizing difference is also an important result, perhaps a provisional one from the perspective of a new standpoint that is distinct from both preceding ones. you\n\nWe do hope and trust that you will have intend to share and discuss our findings. This will be our main task; but we do not want to forget that scholarly exchange of ideas will take place in a German land that is rich in traditions. We are going to show you in the G.DR these traditions are cherished and protected. For that reason; visits to our historical sites are a part of our program. To mention here the most important places, we shall travel not only to Berlin but to Potsdam; Erfurt, Weimar, Eisenach, Gotha, and Leipzig too: We hope that such loci will deepen and stimulate our communication Historical sites are only significant for us to such a degree as we are able to discover sources of OUI thinking, of our development; and again, and to stimulation by means of ever new views of our history . how again gain xi\n\nW.R.

The entire planet has the responsibility for this history; to undertake this responsibility is one of our common objectives.

From this   niche proliferated students and students of students, out from Berlin in the 1960s to Greifswald, Rostock, Jena, Erfurt, Leipzig, and elsewhere. A separate line of science studies descended in the Academy of Sciences from the unit for Science; Theory and Organization; and it too emerged on the edges of the economic, political, and philosophical power structures. The section headings   here are meant to suggest   that \"science studies\"  (Wissenschaftsforschung) in this socialist regime had investigated similar categories of discipline formation as in OUr Westemn regimes: institutions; theory of science; theories of method, epistemology, evolution; laboratories, Naturphilosophie, society, and social construction. Our thesis is that science studies in socialist and capitalist culture were less far apart than many thought.1 they fanning\n\nSince the time that these chapters were presented in 1988 and subsequently   rewritten;   changes intellectually that make them the last work of its kind in the German socialist tradition.

The assimilation process is by now well underway in the two Germanies, though the is heavy: the dismissal of about 50% of East German academicians and up to 70% of the members of the Academy of Sciences. This volume records a cultural tradition that may soon disappear. As the authors notes  reveal, of the younger colleagues have lost their positions; and other senior persons are likely to follow.

Over 250 dissertations issued from this Department during their successive tenures. Students and colleagues of established similar chairs at the Academy of Sciences for the study of science in society (Kröber chapter) and at other universities. Ley's multivolume History of the Enlightenment and Atheism began to appear in 1966; he wrote that \"the objective of the work before us is the origin of elements of the scientific world view, not the genesis of the religious (p. 3). Of particular interest to us in the pluralistic West is Ley's claim that world view 9): Atheism was evidently an the origin of the scientific (p. article of faith shared by many intellectuals during the forty-five year reign of Marxism-Leninism in the GDR:. So too was materialism: Ley Ley\n\nBy comparison;, others; following Marx, took the dialectics of evolution to be the basis of all dialectics, with the world of non-evolution as a special foreshortened case: Peter Ruben s essays appeared under the title \"dialectics of labor\" (1975) in West Germany. Colleagues there saw to it that this stream in Marxism came to public attention. Ruben adhered closer t0 Hegel's and Marx's original intent; a world of evolution in' which 'motion\" in nature led to 'productive activity\" in animals, and this was labeled \"revisionist'' and the Solidarity revolt in August 1980 in\n\nHerbert Hörz set the tone for Marxist-Leninism with his first major Der dialektische Determinismus in Natur und Gesellschaft publication; (1962). It served to link natural science with dialectics on a factual basis and had a positive reception because there was nothing comparable: His later books were broadened extensions of this one (1974). Hörz believed that dialectics is that of a non-evolving world governed by what he calls 'dialectical determinism with the dialectics of evolution or development additional case. His first major book thus superimposed as an foreshadowed the future of the GDR It was a theory of non-evolution According to his critics, it had no capacity for  growth, e.g-, 'the deficiency of the Marxism promoted among us to date in relation to the 'women's question= is only one aspect\" (Dölling, 1990, p. 675).\n\nPoland was the occasion to \"censure just as strictly the members of the Institute [for Philosophy of the Academy of Sciences] who had spoken out for Ruben. This affected Dr. sc. Peter Beurton, Dr. Bruno Hartmann, SC. Werner Röhr, Dipl W. Templin and Dr. sc. Camilla   Warnke (reassignment, heavy limitation of possible scholarly work, up to firing without notice). These clashes were linked with political and academic relations and coordinated by the Institute leadership [Institutsleitung: the Party organs, and the board for philosophical research\" (Klenner, 1990). So wrote the Chairman of the Scientific Council of the Philosophical Institute of the Academy of Sciences. Dominating this forty-year era was thus the fear of legal recrimination;  as these two new directors also testified (Ruben &amp; Kuchling; 1990): phil.\n\nThe Central Institute of the Academy and the Philosophy Department intend to contribute to analysis and knowledge of the history of GDR philosophy by presenting in public and discussing serious events and personal fates in this history . To these events belongs the arrest of three students of the Humboldt University and their sentencing to many years of prison. The case occurred in 1958 The political tansfommation since October 1989 makes it possible and compellingly necessary to analyze and judge this event as a component of the real history of philosophy in the GDR A complete working up of the history of philosophy of the GDR is not exhausted in new retrospective  reflections but requires exposing the influence of political relations and intentions on the conditions, forms, and results of philosophical activity not least on the personal fates of students; workers, and university teachers, who as involvement, Or other circumstances, had to expect in part negative consequences (p. 1008). very grave\n\nWith this background in mind, let us examine a collective work. com memorating the tenth anniversary of the founding of Ley's subsection; World View and Method (Griese &amp; Laitko, 1969). The editors inform us that colleagues formed working committee to \"democratic\" and \"anti-Fascist\"' ideological education to the schools, called \"world viewphilosophical education in natural science instruction\" (P. 4) Ironically, it was Herbert Hötz (1969) who explained in this volume that dialectical materialism before Marx treated nature as matter, but without dialectics it could not account for how, from productive forces, nature gave rise to social and economic structures. Since scientific work is one productive force, science would henceforth be following Lenin as a \"reflection of the economic basis of the society\" (p. 32) bring regarded\n\nAmong the other spokespersons for the reinterpretation of Marx was\n\nLxi the aforementioned Peter Ruben, also a student, who related 'natural dialectics\" to a critique of the so-called \"Neo-Left-Hegelians\" Alfred Theodor W. Adorno (Ruben, 1969, P. 64). He reproached Habermas (1963) for claiming that nature and history are separate, and hence for denying the \"dialectic of nature (p. 54). Western Marxists had argued on the basis of the early Marx that nature has history only in reference to humans.  MarxistLeninists made it an article of faith that nature, as matter, has a history, and that quantum and the theory of relativity support this natural dialectic. Thus the concept of work entails a unity of man and nature. Ley theory\n\nwork, we use up the material object and produce a use-value (Gebrauchswert) (p. 153). Schmidt considered work from the standpoint of the value-using citizen   (Bürger) wrote  Ruben,  while he, Ruben, viewed it (with Marx) from the standpoint of the worker. He argued that the former entailed capitalist structures, the latter required socialist ones. The former was   called negative dialectics (Adorno; 1966), the latter natural dialectics. Evidently Ruben had overstepped the bounds of grace in the party line.

However, the real theoretical issue between Hörz and Wessel and their critics was this: believed that social laws are somehow an extension of mechanical and biological ones. No discussion of empirical social science and dialectics need occur because Marx had they\n\nThus East and West German interpretations of \"world view (Weltanschauung) since the 1960s entailed different Marx interpretations as they came to terms with the relationship between the natural and social sciences. In West   Germany, various   critiques of ideology  appeared, generally at odds with OI utterly ignoring East Gemman Marxists. The history is dialectical (cf. Marcuse; 1968 [1932]). In East Germany, the official program of sociopolitical, if not economic determinism endorsed \"dialectical materialism\" and criticized 'bourgeois capitalism On the face of it, natural and social dialectics were one continuum 9\n\ndone all the work.

Other institutions recognizing GDR culture are the Deutschland Archiv; edited from Cologne, the IGW-Report über Wissenschaft und Technologie in der DDR und anderen RGW-Ländern from Wissenschaft from the Bund demokratischer  Wissenschaftlerinnen und Wissenschaftler in Marburg. Their institutional and intellectual  assess ments contributed to the evaluation of GDR scholars and institutes by the Scientific Council in Bonn in 1991.\n\n## EAST EUROPEAN EFFORTS TO ANALYZE SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINE FORMATION\n\nFar less well known in the West are East European efforts to analyze scientific discipline formation the past decade; inspired by Soviet scholarship. The level of analysis of discipline formation has grown out of work on scientific schools (Mikulinskii, 1977, 1979).

Danziger (1990) extended this model measure and sort students using the investigative practices of psychology. Here is a fruitful example of the integration of cognitive  and social factors. A more theoretical model comes from a prominent German sociologist.  Niklas Luhmann offered a sociology of knowledge model (1980) drawn in part from Talcott Parsons. Luhmann proposes shift from stratification to functional differentiation employing an evolutionary model of selection processes. It led to a valuable focus on the emergence of semantic and social structures and matic pieces (Lemaine et al , 1976) and well-documented archival studies of a discipline between other disciplines (Kohler, 1984) complete our stock-taking. propriate\n\nA recent volume on 'Science in Germany: The Intersection of Institutional   and Intellectual Issues\" considers the relations of German scientific thought and practice to institutions (Olesko; 1989). From our perspective; however, these leading North American historians of German science and education treat aspects of   disciplines-in-the-making: e.g., philosophy as versus applied, medicine as science,   general   science;  organic   chemistry; electrical technology, pure and mathematics, and eugenics. A discipline is, after all, more than a reservoir of knowledge. The more interesting issues of discipline formation are not purely intellectual ones: And institutions; while crucial, do not exhaust the topic of disciplines. The discipline is evidently a level of analysis lying somewhere between ideas and institutions,   intersecting with such   topics as \"academic   entrepreneurship; 'personal promotion; and \"the professionalization of research activity\" (Tumner, 1989). pure applied\n\nMitchell Ash and I have elsewhere argued that the field of psychology established itself as an academic discipline in the course of the nineteenth century, and that it became professionalized in the twentieth century 1982, 1987). Here I suggest a roughly similar sequence for the other disciplines.   The authors   explore  nineteenth-century   discipline-specific factors (in mathematics, psychology, physics) as well as extra-disciplinary ones (salons, bridge-building, biologism as ideology) showing the fluid nature of nineteenth-century disciplines. also some twentieth-century professional issues (mathematics and ideology, communication-oriented studies, scientific communities). Together reflect a sophistication beyond the older notions of discipline formation that  assumed linear accumulation of knowledge. the under standing of disciplines beyond the market model and the reproduction theory mentioned above. We hope here to deepen and broaden these traditional models of North American and East European science studies into a richer model for the 1990s. explore They they They push\n\n## GLOBAL INTERDEPENDENCE OF EMERGING SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINES\n\nGranted,   then; modern disciplines have been in flux and their   areas overlapping, especially on the side, since at least the nineteenth century. Yet the nineteenth century was also the time when disciplines became   identified as such.  Disciplines entail research activity and pedagogy in various institutional settings (Coleman &amp; Holmes, 1988,P. 2). The other side of the investigative enterprise is the teaching function of the research team, both in conveying general knowledge to entering students and in apprenticing older students in the tacit knowledge of investigation and the working techniques of scientific discovery took on various guises, depending on the personalities and institutional public\n\nAs the practitioner of science becomes a topic of historical attention; we learn of the local knowledge in discipline formation: the scientific schools at on remind us that regional and national differences are vital components of emerging disciplines: The Russian 'research collective' at institutions (Yaroschevskii, 1982) for example, may well differ from the American medical school at private universities, as the latter differ between one another. public\n\nAmong other potent features of the North American situation was the necessity to compete for funding: Between and even within disciplines;\n\nthe going was rough in terms of the competitive allocation of resources. To take one example, 'general physiology\" struggled with zoology; cell embryology, neurophysiology, and many other specialties for an institutional place in medical schools and universities until well into the twentieth \"in those decades the most notable phenomenon was lack of discipline' (Pauly, 1987) biology, century;\n\nThe times are now ripe for a convergence of approaches from East and West. World views well may remain intact for some time; underpinned as are by political values. If the polemics about world cooperation in the face of mutual threats to survival have any force; it is incumbent upon students science and society to take these \"world view\" lenses into account in their reportage on science. What we see here is that problems of common concern are illuminated and brought into focus rather than obfuscated by acknowledging the complementary world views of East and West. they of:\n\nWe that this volume may serve to introduce a new era in which we consider more fully the cultural   contexts of  disciplines.   Cultural relativity is a desideratum of science studies. We should not be taken in by the form of GDR science studies; the occasional incantations against the efforts  of  those   scholars   caught within a dangerous nexus of totalitarian instruments of power.   Virtually   all were members of Socialist Unity and communists  of the some stripe. The real issues transpired at the level of individual efforts to reform a resistant social science ideology initially in the natural sciences and recently in the communication sciences.

The main claim (A1) about these efforts being \"casualties of the Cold War\" is supported by several premises about the totalitarian constraints, party membership requirements, and eventual invalidation of scholars' work. The secondary argumentative thread (A5-A6) captures the authors' mistaken optimism about liberalization before the fall of the GDR. I included only the most significant ADUs that directly contribute to these main argumentative threads, avoiding peripheral details.",
