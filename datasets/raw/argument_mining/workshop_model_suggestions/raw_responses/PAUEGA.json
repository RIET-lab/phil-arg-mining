If his brothers were  jovial, easy  going and inclined to be  portly, Ernesto was slender,  serious, aesthetic  and elegant. His  voice  was clipped, his  sentences  crisp and  his  manner refined.  They  called  him  Ôil  filosofoÕ the  philosopher, but  he  was really an artist ... ÔChemicals will kill the world,Õ Ernesto would say, little  realising that in sixty  years his would no  longer be a  voice crying in  the wilderness  (Maria Triaca, 1985, p.116).\n\n## Abstract\n\nErnesto Genoni (1885-1975)  pioneered biodynamic agriculture in Australia. In 1928 he was the first of (ultimately) twelve Australians to join Rudolf SteinerÕs  Experimental Circle of  Anthroposophical  Farmers and  Gardeners (ECAFG)  which  was based  at the Goetheanum, Dornach, Switzerland. Ernesto trained as an artist for five years  at MilanÕs prestigious  Brera Academy.  He  visited  his  brothers  in Australia,  broad-acre  immigrant farmers  in Western Australia,  in 1912 and 1914  and  during these visits  he worked  on their, and otherÕs, farms. In 1916 he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) and served  as  a  stretcher  bearer  on  the  battlefields  of  the  Somme,  France,  before being conscripted into  the  Italian  Army  and  serving  jail-time  in  Italy  as  a  draft  resister  and conscientious objector. Ernesto joined the Anthroposophical Society in Milan in 1919. He first met Rudolf Steiner in 1920 at the Goetheanum, the Anthroposophy headquarters  in Switzerland. Ernesto left the Goetheanum in 1924 when Steiner retired from public life. He migrated to Australia in 1926 with aspirations  for establishing a career as an artist in Australia. Instead, having arrived in Australia, he was again drawn into farm management and  agricultural  work.  Ernesto  was a  champion  for biodynamic  agriculture, Anthroposophy, and the Austrian New Age philosopher, Rudolf Steiner - causes  to which he devoted the rest of his  life. In 1928 he initiated the first Anthroposophy meetings  in Melbourne. In 1930 Ernesto made a grand tour of biodynamic enterprises in Europe and met  the  leading  biodynamics advocates and  practitioners of  the  day  in  Germany, Switzerland and  England,  including  Ehrenfried  Pfeiffer,  Erika Riese,  Ernst  Stegemann, and Carl Mirbt.  In  1935 Ernesto and  his  partner, Ileen Macpherson,  who  was  also  an anthroposophist  and  a  member  of  the  ECAFG,  began  their  biodynamic  farm  called Demeter  Biological  Farm  in  Dandenong,  Victoria.  Ernesto  was a  founder of  the Anthroposophical Society Victoria Michael Group in 1932, and he became its  leader  in 1962.\n\nKeywords: Biodynamics,  biodynamic  farming,  organic  agriculture,  organic  farming, Anthroposophy,  Milan,  WWI,  Somme,  Pozières,  Dornach,  Goetheanum,  Broomehill, Broome  Hill,  Western  Australia,  Demeter,  Rudolf  Steiner,  Ehrenfried  Pfeiffer,  Ernst Stegemann, Ruby Macpherson.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nErnesto Genoni (1885-1975)  was  a man torn between two worlds. In Italy he was  an artist (Fig.1), in  Australia  he  was a  farmer. In Europe he was a married man, in Australia he was  a de facto partner. In Italy there was  his sister Rosa, old enough to be his  mother and for  whom he was  the ÒfavouriteÓ, in Australia there were Òthe brothersÓ  who had preceded him and  created  their  own Little Italy  in  the wheat  belt  of  Western  Australia  with  their homesteads, including ÒEtnaÓ  and ÒSorrentoÓ, and  their successful  broad-acre  farms (Genoni,  c.1955). In  Australia,  Ernesto volunteered in  the  Australian  Imperial  Force (AIF)  in  World  War  I  (WWI)  Òto  serve  in the medical  corpsÓ,  but, as an  Australian stretcher-bearer  on  the  killing  fields of  the Somme  he  was  conscripted  into  the  Italian Army, quite possibly saving his life but leading to  multiple  prison  terms   in  Italian  jails   as  a draft resister and a conscientious objector.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nErnesto  brought  biodynamic agriculture  and Anthroposophy  to Australia in the 1920s. He\n\nFigure  1.  Ernesto  Genoni,  self  portrait,  circa 1920-1926.\n\nwas  the  first  Australian  member  of  Rudolf  SteinerÕs  Experimental  Circle  of  Anthroposophical Farmers and Gardeners  (ECAFG) whose raison d'être was  to put to the test the  ÒhintsÓ  given  in  1924  by  Rudolf  Steiner  at  his  Agriculture  Course  presented  at Koberwitz (now  Kobierzyce).  Ernesto met Rudolf Steiner, and leading anthroposophists Elizabeth Vreede (mathematician),  and  Edith Maryon (sculptor)  at  the Goetheanum at Dornach, Switzerland in 1920. He spent much of 1924 at the Goetheanum, painting and studying, until September 1924 when Steiner withdrew from public life due to ill health. Ernesto  migrated to Australia  in  1926  announcing plans  for  exhibiting  his  art.  He  left Australia in 1930 for a six-month grand tour of biodynamic endeavours in Europe, visiting the  leading  advocates and  practitioners of  biodynamics of  the  day, including  Dr Ehrenfried Pfeiffer  and Ernst Stegemann. It was  the last time he would depart Australia as  an ÒItalianÓ. In 1932 he applied to be a naturalized Australian and thereby cemented his commitment to the New World while maintaining his links to the Old.\n\nErnestoÕs  commitment  to  biodynamics  and  Anthroposophy  were lifelong.  He practiced biodynamics  in Western Australia  and in  Victoria.  With  his  partner,  Ileen  Macpherson (1899-1984), he established the first ÒDemeterÓ farm in Australia. He was a founder of the Anthroposophical Society  Victoria, aka the Michael Group,  and in his  twilight years  he was its leader. This is his story.\n\n## 2 Methods\n\nThe  present  account  draws  on  primary  sources including  archival  material  (held  in Switzerland and Australia) and a handwritten autobiographical manuscript memoir by the\n\nsubject, supplemented by published material.

A timeline with some milestones of his   life is  presented in Table 1. Ernesto was  reportedly one of 18 children,  of whom eleven survived into adulthood with Ernesto being the youngest of those (Triaca, 1985). WIth the exception of the eldest sister,  Rosa  Genoni, all of  the surviving  Genoni  siblings  migrated  to Australia, starting with the departure of Emilio, at the age of 17, with Ernesto recording in his   memoir: ÒThe departure of Emilio for Australia in the first year of schoolÓ (Genoni, c.1955, p.1). As  we shall see, Ernesto was  a somewhat hesitant migrant and he was  the final of the siblings to migrate.\n\nIn a family memoir, Maria Triaca wrote that Òa steady exodus  of people from our region began in the 1890sÓ (1985, p.5). The reasons appear to be at least twofold, privation and conscription.  As   a  unified  country,  Italy  was  then  a  relatively  young  country  with  the Kingdom of Italy being proclaimed in 1861 (Nicolle, 2003). At the outbreak of World War 1 (WWI) ÒItaly remained an overwhelmingly agricultural country, and over three-quarters of the  rural  population  were  landless  peasantsÓ  (Nicolle,  2003,  p.3).  Nevertheless  Italy harboured imperial aspirations and at the end of the nineteenth century, and following the lead of other European powers, embarked on a series of military misadventures  of landgrabbing  in  Africa, collectively described as ÒThe  Scramble  for Africa 1876-1912Ó (Pakenham, 1992). Italy supported its  military adventurism by conscripting its young men. This  was  the immediate cause of EmilioÕs departure for Australia, alone and at the age of 17 years (C. Negri, 1984).\n\nSubsequently,  each  brother,  migrated to Australia as  they  became  of  conscriptionable age. According to a daughter, Emilio Òmade a promise to his father that heÕd bring out all his  brothers   and sisters, so therefore he promised he would send so much every three months  home, and that is  what he did, and he brought them out one by oneÓ (C. Negri, 1984,  p.3).  The  youngest  brother,  Ernesto  was  the  exception  to  this  pattern.  One  of EmilioÕs  daughters  stated in an interview, many years after the events, that for her father Emilio Òmilitary service was  coming up ... He was   reaching the age of eighteen and he was  anti-war, so he decided that he would ... leave Italy. And his  father ... said to him ÔI donÕt know what you are going to do ... you have to have moneyÕ. So he borrowed and the fare cost thirteen pounds and I think he borrowed about twenty pounds. He had to go to England to pick up the boatÓ (E. Negri, 1984, p.1). According to her account ÒHis father\n\nhad a shop [in Milan], where they used to make shoes  for the elite ... he used to employ five to seven menÓ (E. Negri, 1984, p.2), however ErnestoÕs  account paints a far less rosy picture.\n\nHaving arrived in Australia, the teenage Emilio initially worked for a German bootmaker in Collins  Street,  Melbourne,  before heading  west  where, after  a short  stint  in Kalgoolie, ÒDad went down to Broomehill and he was able to get a job putting down the railway line, the Great Southern Railway line from PerthÓ  (E. Negri, 1984, p.4). ÒWhile he was  there going through Broomehill he happened to see some land and thatÕs  when he bought his first property which he called ÔMilan PlaceÕÓ (E. Negri, 1984, p.5). This was the beginning of a Little  Italy in  the south  west  corner  of Western Australia in  the wheat  belt  and  to where, over  time, further Genoni brothers  and sisters  migrated and set up homesteads and broadacre farms. These Australian developments  occurred during the childhood of Ernesto Genoni which was  spent  in Italy  and which was, by  his  own  account, one of privation.\n\nErnestoÕs memoir begins  in Ò1889 or 1890Ó where he describes  himself as  Òa sickly little boyÓ and he recalls  Òthe anxious search for the beret with the pom pom in the middle that I had lostÓ (Genoni, c.1955, p.1). Of his time at the kindergarten in Tirano he writes of Òthe painful chilblains on the handsÓ (p.1). He goes to stay with his grandmother in Grosio and in the first grade he remembers  Òthe piece of wood that we had to take to school each morning to keep the fire going in the stoveÓ (p.1). At kindergarten he recalls  Òthe cherries shared  out  among  the  childrenÓ  (p.1),  his  Òaffectionate  grandmaÓ,  and  Òthe  roasted chestnuts that she would give to us in bed in the morningÓ (p.2).\n\nÒOctober  1892 we departed  from  Grosio with mum  and [brother] Achille  ...  Grandma accompanied us  to the end of the road past the church. The affectionate goodbye ... we were  never  again  to see her  in this  lifeÓ  (Genoni,  c.1955,  p.2).  Ernesto  writes  of  the Òintense morning coldnessÓ and of Milan as Òthe beginning of my long period of sadness and  nostalgiaÓ  (p.3).  At  school  there  was   Òthe  young  assistant  who  detested  usÓ,  he remembers  that Òthe Milanese youngsters  detested us  and mocked usÓ and that these were Òsad days for the two country childrenÓ (p.3).\n\nErnesto describes  the financial position of the family as  ÒdestituteÓ and their  dwelling as Òthe  tight  hovelÓ  (Genoni,  c.1955,  p.3).  He  mentions  his  ongoing  anaemia  during  his teenage years  and  his  unrequited  love:  Òthe  vision  of  the  girl at  the  water  pump.  My infatuation  lasted  several  years  without  me  ever  having  the  courage  to  divulge  my feelingsÓ (Genoni, c.1955, p.8).\n\nErnesto studied art at MilanÕs  Brera (Accademia di Belle Arti di Brera; Brera Academy of Fine Art)  for five years  (1906-1910) (Genoni, c.1955). Ernesto says  he was  Òalways  the favourite brother of RosaÓ (p.5). Rosa was the eldest of the siblings and the ÔmatriarchÕ of the  family,  she  forged  a  successful  career  and  life  in  Italy  as   a  fashion  designer  (R. Genoni, 1924), as  the wife of a leading Milan lawyer, and as a ÒsocialistÓ (E. Negri, 1984, p.6)  and a peace activist (WILPF, 1921).  Rosa supported the migration of  the siblings, and  she  kept  in  regular  contact,  however  she  herself  never  visited  Australia.

He had left a European winter and arrived in the middle of an Australian summer. He writes: ÒAustralia!! The great joy of having my name called from the crowd while waiting to disembark  from the ÔAusterlitzÕ. We talked all night  with the brothers  in RinaÕs  houseÓ  (p.10).  The  brothers  had  broadacre  farms at  Broome  Hill  (it  is  now Broomehill), 304 km from Perth (www.googlemaps.com) (Fig. 2).\n\nErnesto records: ÒSome painting but soon I am fully into farming at EtnaÓ, EmilioÕs  farm (Genoni, c.1955,  p.10).  He  writes  cryptically  of  ÒSpiritualism ...  the  idea of the  colony suggested by Rosa. Morris  surprises me in seeing how seriously he takes up the ideas of spiritualismÓ (pp.10-11).\n\nMaria Triaca describes  the Little Italy that the Genoni brothers  had created in the wheat belt of WA and that Ernesto was now stepping into:\n\n'The  Genoni  brothers  -  Angelo,  Maurice,  Achille,  Charlie,  Jack and  Emil  -  were  an extraordinary, if not  eccentric  bunch. They arrived  in  the  West  in  dribs  and  drabs  in  the 1890s just as the gold rush was beginning. After  a stint in the mines they turned to clearing land  in  the  south-west. They  were  pioneers  who  lived  first  in  tents,  then  slab  huts and farmhouses on their  own properties. Ernesto, the artist and youngest of the family, who had a  predilection  for  spiritualism and  organic  farming,  had  not yet  arrived  in  Australia.  The\n\nbrothers' farms were all within a few miles of each other, roughly in  a  straight  line  between  the t o wns  of  Flat  Rocks  and Borderdale  ...  Italian  names prevailed  when  the brothers selected  their  properties  which bore  titles  like  Sorrento,  Etna and Belvedere'  (Triaca, 1985, p. 89).\n\n'Sorrento,  Angelo's  property, was  the  showplace  of  the district. It was a  sprawling brick place with  all the  trappings of a Victorian  townhouse -ceiling roses, cornices,  Persian rugs and a cellar off the kitchen' (p.89)\n\nFigure 2. Broomehill, wheat belt of WA (photo: J.Paull, 2014).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'Angelo  was famous for  his  wines  from Broomehill  to  Tambellup.  He  spent  hours in  the vineyard  behind  the  house, pruning  and  spraying  the  grapes. The  cellar  was  full  of  his homemade wine, but he also made grappa - highly illegal - in a still ... Every agent or  wool buyer who visited Sorrento was offered a glass of the virulent clear spirit' (p.90).\n\n'The garden at Sorrento  was just as grand as the  house. Standing  in  the  centre  was a fountain ... this was Angelo's way a creating a little  bit of Italy in the middle of Australia ... Out the back was the vineyard, rows and  rows of grapevines, pear  trees and apples, figs and lemons. Nothing was left to chance. WIth the  pigs, geese  and ducks, we could  have been  totally  self-sufficient  My  new  brother-in-law  was  a  mixture  of  Australian  outback toughness  and  European  civility  and  extravagance.  WIth  no  farming  background  -  he worked in a wine  shop before  coming to Australia - he had  developed a successful farm running  a  thousand  sheep.  He  mustered  on  horseback,  cleared  mallet thickets,  classed wool, was at  home on a  jinker  and  became  an  expert rifle  shot ...  My sister  [from Italy] walked  into  this  environment  and  felt  happier  than  ever  before.  She  became  the  perfect farmer's wife' (pp.90-91).\n\n'Part of her  luggage included a collection of seeds, and within  months of their  arrival, the vegetable  garden  at  Sorrento  was crammed  with  vegetables none  of  us had  seen  since leaving home: zucchini, endive, chicory and flat-leaved parsley' (pp.98-99).\n\n'Angelo  was a  voracious  reader  ... Although  brought up  a Catholic,  conventional  religion held nothing for  him and he had long discarded it, but he was very interested in philosophy and later turned to spiritualism and anthroposophy as a follower of Rudolf Steiner' (p.91).\n\nAt this  time of his life Ernesto was  a dapper young Italian artist, a city boy with five years of training at MilanÕs  Brera Academy. The opportunities  in the bush were for  farming, for hard physical labour. If there were opportunities for plying his trade as an artist they might have been found in the cities, in Perth or Melbourne for example, but Ernesto does  not appear to have seriously explored such options. The brothers  had forged their new lives in their adopted country; from teenage migrants they were now men of the land, who had spent their  whole  adult  life in the Australian  ÔbushÕ  and under  the Aussie sun. Ernesto would certainly have been the odd man out, and he was  restless. He writes: ÒAbout April 1913 I go with Angelo to Victoria. Angelo marries  Matilde. Philip LÕHardy wants  to settle me on the land on the Kowerup [Koo Wee Rup, WA] farm. I refuse the offer and after a few weeks ... I return to Italy by the English boatÓ (Genoni, c.1955, p.11).\n\n## 3.3 Return to Italy\n\nBack in Italy. I am 28 and indeed I am going through the most awful time in my life (Genoni, c.1955, p.11).\n\nThe decision to return to Italy in 1913 quickly turns  sour for  Ernesto. He writes  that: Òat last I decide to return to AustraliaÓ (p.11).\n\nErnestoÕs situation had been different from that of his  siblings. The brothers  had left Italy to avoid ItalyÕs  conscription, and both brothers  and sisters  alike had migrated to a new land  to  forge  a  new  life.  They  had  done  just  that,  and  by  all  accounts   remarkably successfully. There was  little or nothing for them in Italy, they had left as  17 year olds, or thereabouts, and while  they  were creating their  happy  ÔLittle ItalyÕ, they were, by now, more  Australian  than  Italian,  their  business  interests  were  in  Australia,  the  skill  sets acquired  were  those  of  the  Australian  bush,  their  adult  life  was all  Australian,  their children were Australian, and their futures were Australian. Ernesto and the brothers were siblings  but the passage of time and their divergent experiences meant that Ernesto was an Italian while the brothers were now Australian, albeit of Italian heritage.\n\nIn  contrast  to  his   siblings,  Ernesto  seems  to  have  visited Australia  on  a  mission  of reconnaissance rather than as  a decisive emigration. The skills  he brought were Italian skills, and the adult life experience that he brought was  that of Italian big-city. There were the  New  World  opportunities  of Australia,  but in  stark  competition were  the Old World nostalgia and the familiarity of Italy. For Ernesto it was an unsettling dichotomy, which by a combination of circumstances  and luck, good and bad, took  more than a decade to resolve.\n\n## 3.4 Return to Australia &amp; enlistment\n\nEvery young man was then enlisting so I thought to enlist too (Genoni, c.1955, p.12).\n\nErnesto writes: Ò1914! After  a month or  two I am working at Etna the World  War  One startsÓ  (Genoni, c.1955, p.11). It is   no easy life: Òafter clearing 5 acres  at Punchimarup I take up a contract to cut and burn down 50 acres  by myself. The life in the bush camped in a tent. The hard work of cutting the green plants   at the level of the ground. Toward the end Morris comes to help meÓ (p.11).\n\nThis  was  followed by  more  land  clearing  until  Òone  morning  the  wind  blew  away  the tentÓ  (Genoni, c.1955, p.12). Ernesto Òleft  the brothersÓ  and Òat Brunswick.  There I got work  at Mr Smith digging potatoes. At first I was  lodging at the hotel but then I got a tent and was  camping in the bushÓ (p.12). Having finished the potatoes, Mr Smith Ògot me a job at the local State farm as  a driver  with 2 horses  and a lorry  carting maize to make insilageÓ (p.12). There was  work  but Ernesto remained restless. ÒLife was   too easy and without  any  interest.  Xmas  1915!  What  a  poor  Xmas! Alone  in  the  bush  with  a sore fingerÓ (p.12).\n\nAt this  point Ernesto made a fateful decision that shaped his  next decade - a decision laced  with  some  irony  given  that  his brothers had  migrated  to  Australia  to  avoid conscription in Italy and that his sister Rosa was  a leading peace activist in Italy. Ernesto writes: ÒAt new year day 1916 I went to Bunbury to enlist with the purpose of serving in the medical corps. Fifteen days after I was  at the Blackboy camp near Perth. It was  not\n\nan easy life at first. Sleeping on a bare floor ... And all that swearing!Ó (Genoni, c.1955, p. 12).\n\nOn his  enlistment papers, Ernesto had his age as  Ò30 years 4 monthsÓ, his  place of birth as ÒTirano, ItalyÓ, his marital status   as single, his occupation as   ÒLabourerÓ, his next of kin as  ÒEmil Genoni, Broome Hill, WAÓ,  his  height as  Ò5 foot 8 inchesÓ, his  weight as  Ò15Ó stone,  his  complexion  as ÒDarkÓ,  his eyes  and  hair  as ÒBrownÓ,  ÒYesÓ  that  he  was prepared to Òundergo inoculation against small pox and enteric feverÓ, and his ÒReligious DenominationÓ  as  ÒTheosophyÓ  (Genoni,  1916).  Thirty  percent  of  enlistees  had  their occupation recorded as ÒLabourerÓ (Scott, 1936), theosophists would have been rare.\n\nErnesto was an unlikely volunteer for the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) of World War 1 (1914-1918). He was  Italian, an artist, and a theosophist. He was the youngest sibling in a pacifist family of which his  older brothers  had each progressively migrated to Australia before they  turned eighteen -  to avoid  being  conscripted into the Italian  army (Triaca, 1985)  which  was  fighting  ItalyÕs  ill-conceived  nineteenth  century  colonial expansionist wars in Africa (including in Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Somaliland) (Nicolle, 2003).\n\nThe AIF training for war was  brief: ÒAfter few weeks  we were sent to continue instruction at Bunbury to be returned again from there to Blackboy waiting to be sent overseas. I mentioned to the sergeant how I enlisted in order to serve in the medical corp and not as a fighter. I was  told that I was  a cold footed and I was  left behind when my company left for Europe. Few weeks  after I left with another contingent. I was  mess  orderly and I liked itÓ  (Genoni,  c.1955, p.13). Ernesto embarked on the troop  ship HMAT Aeneas  leaving Fremantle on 17 April 1916 (AIF, 1916d).\n\nThese fresh unbloodied troops  were sent to France via ÒEgypt. Suez ... The flies!  The sand storm ... we embarked at Alexandria and disembarked at Marseille. From here to ƒtaples  [a  base  camp  outside  of  Paris]  by  train  ...  I  was  made  cookÕs  helper  in  the kitchen. The drilling with straw bags and bayonets. The oral instructions  by that red faced Sergeant Major!Ó (Genoni, c.1955, p.13).\n\n## 3.5 The Somme WW1 AIF\n\nThen  we  were  sent  to  the  Somme  ...  Pozières  ...  The  sergeant calls for  volunteer stretcher bearers. I came forward ... the first vision of dead bodies. My inner trust of Christ as Lord even of the shells! (Genoni, c.1955, p.14).\n\nIn 1916 there was  no more dangerous  place in the world to be than Òthe Western FrontÓ in  general, and  Pozières  in particular  (Charlton,  1986). The first Australian to enlist  in WWI in the AIF is  buried at Pozières  (Crawley, 2014). And Pozières  was  to be the first engagement for Ernesto, and the AIFÕs 4th Australian Division, 16th Battalion.\n\nOnce at the front line, Ernesto volunteered as  a stretcher bearer.and was  at immediately in  the midst of the  bloody  maelstrom. The Somme was, and remains, the  most  lethal battlefield  in  which Australian troops  have ever  engaged.  The  scene at Pozières  was described as  ÒDead and wounded lay  everywhere, some killed on their stretchers, with the stretcher bearers lying dead beside themÓ (Bean, 1929, p.709).\n\nAccording to Charles Bean, AustraliaÕs official war historian:\n\n'In  the first AIF everyone had looked on the work of stretcher-bearers as rather  suitable for men who, for some reason, disliked more than most the prospect of killing others ... I dare say that in  the  long  run  a  good  many of those who  did  become  stretcher-bearers  ... did volunteer for  it because they were that kind of man, who deep in their hearts preferred being killed to killing' (Bean, 1947, p.116).\n\n'Until the First Battle of the Somme many battalions had used their  bandsmen as stretcherbearers. After   that battle  this  system generally was abandoned. For  one  thing, after  such battles the  band  was too  badly needed for  cheering up the troops! A battle  like Pozières sometimes made a clean sweep of the regimental bearers. Also, on its side, the work of the bearers was too important to be left to unselected men; they were now specially selected 'for their physique and guts'' (p.118).\n\n'They needed to ... stand up  to a trial like that of Pozières … a reeking desert of bombarded shell  craters, the  stretcher-bearers  and  runners  were  the  only  ones  who  were  regularly expected to move through barrages which ... cut off the front line from the rear. Most men who went through the battle will recall the little parties of four   or   five men who would come, erect, winding their way across that wilderness, amid the shell bursts, with the leader holding a stick  with a white rag - the handiest substitute for  a red cross flag. That flag would usually prevent the German snipers from shooting, but nothing could stop the barrages ... 'It's no good  dropping  the  stretcher  now  -  if  we're  going  to  be  hit  we  shall  be  hit,  walking  or crouching!'  So  they  went  proudly  erect  at  Pozières,  Passchendaele  and  Messines,  too, throughout the war  ... The stretcher-bearers won ... the highest place in the estimate of all their comrades' (p.118).\n\nÒFor  men  thrown into the  fighting at  Pozières  the  experience  was simply hell  É  Stretcher-bearers worked  to  exhaustion, usually exposed  to  fire,  carrying  men  to the  aid  posts close  behind  the front  line.  Sergeant Albert Coates recorded:  ÔMany  men  buried  and torn  to  pieces  by  high  explosive. For a mile behind the trenches it is a perfect hell of shell fire. Terrible sights.  The  stretcher-bearers  are having a terrible time, some blown to pieces  together with their living freightÕÓ (Burness, 2006).\n\nFigure  3. Australian   stretcher  bearers  on   the  Somme  (Will Dyson, 1917,  Australian War  Memorial  Canberra,  public\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nErnesto  wrote  of:  ÒThe  front  line dug-out. The  soldier with  the shattered foot crawling in. My dwindling strength. Three days after we were sent back into the rear. My failing in going back  to the dug-out to bring in some of the wounded there remained for long as an inner reproachÓ (Genoni, c.1955, p.14).\n\nOf  WWI  stretcher-bearers Òmany  companies had  every stretcher-bearer killed or wounded. Wherever  a wounded man was  seen... these men made their way, whatever the danger ... every man watched and respected themÓ (Bean, 1947, p.117). Australian war  artist,  Will Dyson commented: ÒThese men  are not  heroes  from choice -  they are heroes because someone has got to be heroicÓ (Dyson, 1918, p.38) (Fig.3).\n\nWriting  on  the  battlefield,  Lieutenant  J.A.  Raws  described  the  grim  situation:  ÒWe  are lousy, stinking, ragged, unshaven, sleepless ... I have a dead manÕs helmet, another dead manÕs  gas  protector, a dead manÕs  bayonet. My  tunic is  rotten with other  menÕs  blood, and partly splattered with a comradeÕs  brainsÓ  (Bean, 1929, p.661). Both Raws  and his brother were killed soon after on the battlefields of the Somme (Bean, 1947).\n\nThe Battle of the Somme was  Òthe bloodiest fighting of the entire war ... a merciless  war of attrition ... The tit-for-tat artillery bombardments reduced town, countryside and soldiers to piles of pulverized wasteÓ (Lindsay, 2011, p.101).\n\nÒAfter  few days  we were sent into Belgium. Ypres. The life in those dug-outs  along the canal, the huge rats. The horrible experience of the barrage. Another great failing of mine when I was called to take away a dying man in the trenches  É then another occasion I saw one of the stretcher-bearers  hit and fall. I gathered my courage and went out. The whistling  of bullets around  me  told  me  soon  that  I  was the  target  of  German snipersÓ (Genoni, c.1955, pp.14-15).\n\nA memorial plaque on a French  town  hall pays  tribute:  ÒIn 1916 the Australian Army entered  the Western Front  with a  force  of  180,000 men,  three  times  the  number  that served in Gallipoli in 1915. 46,000 of the 60,000 killed in the War  died on the Western Front. From a population of just 4.5 million people, 313,000 volunteered to serve during the War. 65% of those became casualtiesÓ (Lindsay, 2011, p.111).\n\nÒBack again in the second line and again in the front line. The barrage with trench mortar. The dying wounded in the front line during the barrage. My conduct was not brilliant. The night in the dug out. The nightmareÓ (Genoni, c.1955, p.15). ErnestoÕs  nightmare came to an abrupt and wholly unexpected end.\n\nItaly  declared  war  on  Germany  on  28 August  1916  (Bean,  1929)  (although  Italy  had entered WWI on 23 May 1915 against the Austro-Hungarian Empire). On 1 September 1916, the Italian Embassy in London wrote to the British War Office: ÒI am directed by H. E. the Italian Ambassador to ask for the discharge of Pte. Ernesto Genoni No. 5362 now serving with the 16th Battalion, 4th A.D.B.D. Australian Expeditionary Force, who is  an Italian subject and whose class  has been called up for serviceÓ (Italian Embassy, 1916, p. 1).  The  request  was forwarded  by  the  AIFÕs Lieutenant  C.R.E.  Jennings to  AIF administration Òfor any action you may deem necessary pleaseÓ (Jennings, 1916)\n\nItalyÕs   request reached Ernesto at the battlefront. ÒThe corporal Cook  one morning calls me and tells me that I am to go to London for discharge from the Australian Army. At first I thought it was a joke, but before evening I was on my way to LondonÓ (Genoni, c.1955, p. 15).  ÒAt  the  request of the War Office you are being transferred to A.I.F. Administrative Headquarters, London, for discharge in order to allow you to join the Italian Army. You will proceed to Popperinghe and catch the 6.28 train on the morning of the 16th inst., and should report to the A.I.F Headquarters in London on the following dayÓ (AIF, 1916g).\n\nErnesto was discharged from the AIF in London on 18 October 1916 Òin consequence of joining  the  Italian ArmyÓ  (Butler,  1916,  p.1).  The  pro  forma Proceedings  of  Discharge stated that the discharge was  Òto join the Italian ArmyÓ and incorrectly stated that Òsuch discharge having been granted to me in England at my own requestÓ. His  Certificate of Character on discharge reported his  Òconduct and characterÓ as Òvery goodÓ (AIF, 1916c)\n\nHis  discharge papers  record his  service as  Ò237 daysÓ and required him to relinquish his right to repatriation to Australia with the form stating that ÒI have no further claim on the Commonwealth Government for or in respect of a free passage from England to Australia now or at any time hereafter and do hereby release the Commonwealth Government from all further claims   and demands  of any kind whatsoever except as regards any Pension to which I may be legally entitled under  the War  Pensions  ActÓ (AIF, 1916e, p.2) Ernesto nominated the address  of his  Òintended place  of residenceÓ  as  ÒVia Cramer  6,  Milano, ItalyÓ which  was the  address of  the  peace  organisations Comitato  Pro  Umanitˆ (Podreider, 2011) and the Italian branch of the WomenÕs  International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF, 1921) in which organisations  ErnestoÕs  sister, Rosa Genoni, was prominent.\n\nBeing conscripted into the Italian Army unexpectedly plucked Ernesto from the ÒhellÓ of the killing fields   of the Western Front. ÒFor  his  service with the Australian Imperial Force Private Genoni is entitled to the British War and Victory medals ... His present address  (if he survives) is unknownÓ (AIF, 1921).\n\n## 3.6 Italian Army\n\n... the  Colonel told  me  that I  must have some good saint in Paradise  looking after me. ÔYesÕ I said ÔI believe soÕ (Genoni, c.1955, p.16).\n\nA handwritten  note  in ErnestoÕs  Australian war  service  records  states  that: ÒThis  man joined the Italian Red Cross  not the Italian ArmyÓ (AIF, 1924). What is certainly true is that Ernesto was  conscripted into the Italian Army, that the AIF  facilitated this,  that Ernesto voluntarily joined the AIF, but there was nothing voluntary about his  conscription into the Italian Army.\n\nErnestoÕs time in the Italian Army, from 1916 until he was  finally demobilized (demobbed) in  March 1919 was  a difficult  time for  him as  he resisted (successfully  but at  personal cost) being Òan  Italian infantry soldierÓ and  the bureaucracy struggled (mostly unsuccessfully) to cope with the concepts of Ôconscientious objectionÕ and Ônon-combatant dutiesÕ  (Genoni,  c.1955).  The  right  to  conscientious  objection  was  not  recognised  by Italian authorities until 1972 (Biesemans, 2014).\n\nErnesto's Italian military experience was punctuated with imprisonment, trials, and service in the medical corps  and a military hospital. The clash of cultures  surfaced immediately with ÒThe refusal to repeat the giuramento formula [the oath]. Sent to prison. Called by the company captain to explain and then sent to another prison. He told me that I was to be sent to Verona in the medical corps for instruction and then to go to the frontÓ (Genoni, c.1955, p.16).\n\nErnesto served in the Military  Hospital at  Verona and he reports  that  Òeventually I was transferred permanently thereÓ (Genoni, c.1955, p.16). Sister Rosa visited her brother in Verona. He writes of ÒHer letter relating to rumours of peace. I read the letter loudly ... an officer took  the letter from me ... I was  sent to prison ... inchained I was  sent to the fort prison on the hill near Verona waiting for the trial ... Then the trail at the Military Tribunal. I got three months which I had already done waiting for the caseÓ (p.17).\n\nIn  ÒSpring  1918Ó,  Ernesto  wrote  ÒHow  tired  of  such  a  life  ...  my  conversation  about spiritual thingsÓ (Genoni, c.1955, p.17). Some optimism which creeps  into his  account is\n\ntinged  with  the  reality  of  disease  sweeping  Europe:  ÒAutumn  1918!  The  14  points  of Wilson. I  believed at the time  that  a new  era was  to enter  into the  World. The raging influenzaÓ (p.17).\n\nTo the end, the relationship between Ernesto and the Italian military was uneasy, at best it seems  to have been an uneasy  truce with their pacifist conscript. ÒI  was  sent to South Italy to accompany a convalescent soldier at his  home. In returning instead of stopping at Verona I went to Milan where I found Rosa and others  of the family sick  with influenza. I stayed for  few days  to nurse them. Then went back  to Verona to be sent to prison for being absent without leave for weeksÓ (Genoni, c.1955, pp.17-18).\n\nÒNovember 1918 Peace! But they kept me till the following March 1919. They discharged me without giving me il pacco di congedo on account of my bad record! But at last I was a free civilian once moreÓ (Genoni, c.1955, p.18).\n\n## 3.7 Rudolf Steiner and Anthroposophy\n\nDornach ... I  was trying to paint in the anthroposophic way. Again at bottom I was not happy with my painting. I was admitted to the Class. My gradual understanding of the German language at the lectures (Genoni, c.1955, pp.19-20).\n\nErnestoÕs  discharge from the AIF  in  1916  extinguished his  right  to  free  repatriation  to Australia, and he did not return to Australia until 1926. The post war years   in Europe for Ernesto (1919-1926) witnessed his introduction to and engagement with Anthroposophy, with  its spiritual  guru,  Rudolf  Steiner  (1861-1925),  and  with  the  Goetheanum,  the headquarters of Anthroposophy at Dornach, Switzerland.\n\nErnesto was  introduced to Anthroposophy in Milan by his  sister  Rosa, shortly  after  his discharge from the Italian Army and he joined the Milan branch of the Anthroposophical Society (Sekretariat, 1924-1975). ÒRosa tells me of Anthroposophy ... Signorina Schwarz was  inviting  Rosa to an Anthroposophy reading in the afternoon. She could not go but asked me if I would like to go. So I went (with Fanny [RosaÕs  daughter] I think) to the first Anthroposophy meeting. For nearly 18  months I went regularly to the weekly Anthroposophy readings. Meanwhile I took up again paintingÓ (Genoni, c.1955, p.18).\n\nThe Anthroposophical Society was  constituted on 2 February 1913 (Lissau, 2005) by Dr Rudolf Steiner, and it grew  out of the Theosophical Society which had been founded in New  York  in 1875  by  Helena  Blavatsky  (1831-1891)  and  was  then  headed  by Annie Besant (1847-1933). Steiner was the inaugural General Secretary of the German Section of the  Theosophical Society  which was  founded in October  1902 (Wachsmuth, 1989). This position gave Steiner leadership of the Society in Germany, Switzerland and AustriaHungary  (Easton,  1980).  In  this  role  Steiner  lectured  and  published  extensively  (e.g Steiner,  1910,  1911). A philosophical falling out between Steiner  and the Theosophical Society  leadership,  based  in  Adyar,  Chennai  (then  Madras),  India,  culminated  in  the expulsion of the German Section from the Theosophical Society in January 1913 (Easton, 1980). The Anthroposophical Society  was  founded in  the  wake  of this  expulsion  with Steiner as Honorary President, the assets  of the defunct Section were transferred to the new  entity (Easton,  1980). At  the time there were over  2500 members  of the German Section and most moved their affiliation across to the new society (Easton, 1980). Steiner subsequently  refounded  the  Society  as  the  General Anthroposophical  Society  on  24\n\nDecember 1923 (Steiner, 1923). Both Theosophy and Anthroposophy are non-religious groups offering similar but different spiritual esoteric philosophies. Both movements are in the perennialist/traditionalist  school  of  philosophy (Huxley,  1946) which  was also championed by  Lord Northbourne (1896-1982), the biodynamic farmer  who coined the term Ôorganic farmingÕ (Paull, 2014a).\n\nRudolf Steiner was  a polymath who has  been described as  Òone of the greatest men of the twentieth centuryÓ  (Wilson, 1985,  p.170)  and Òone of the most influential -  yet  also controversial - reformers   of the 20th centuryÓ (Vegesack &amp; Kries, 2010, p.16). Steiner was prolific, he delivered more than 5,000 lectures  (Stewart, 2012) and is   the author of more than 300  books  (Turgeniev, 2003). In  person,  he was  charismatic,  and as  a  speaker, mesmerizing. He  spoke extemporaneously,  he  Òused  no  notes  at  allÓ  (Sunday  School Chronicle, 1922). His  writing has  been described as  ÒimpenetrableÓ  (Lachman, 2007, p. 114) but in person Òhe possessed the qualities  of expositor and preacher to a matchless degree ... Dr Steiner ... soon holds his listeners under the spell of his powerÓ (Hare, 1922, p.219). Steiner left  some  listeners Òdeeply impressedÓ and others Òfrankly perplexedÓ  (Manchester  Guardian,  1922).  Worldwide practical movements  have  grown out  of  SteinerÕs  New  Age  philosophies  including  Waldorf  education  and  biodynamic agriculture.\n\nWhen Ernesto left Australia in 1916, he stated his  religion as  ÒTheosophistÓ. A decade later when he returned to Australia he was  an Anthroposophist. It was  a journey fostered by Rosa and entrenched by visits  to Dornach, meeting Steiner, and attending SteinerÕs lectures. Anthroposophy was to become a lifelong raison dÕêtre for Ernesto.\n\nÒIn 1920 ... I went to Dornach. What a strange impression I received from the first view of the  Goetheanum  building  ...  the  short  conversation  with  FrŠulein  [Elizabeth]  Vreede [1879-1943] ... chilly! ... the meeting with the Doctor  [Rudolf Steiner] ... the bewildering impression of the interior  of the Goetheanum. I could not enter  in such saturated life of the spirit and after a few days  I left ... the reproach from Miss [Edith] Maryon [1872-1924]. In the following years  it was  a painful search to find my way in lifeÓ  (Genoni, c.1955, p. 19).\n\nThe Goetheanum building (pronounced girty-arn-um)  takes  its  name from the  German philosopher Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832) who has been characterized as a Òuniversal geniusÓ  (Vi'tor, 1950, p.3). Steiner had spent years  editing GoetheÕs  scientific works for publication  and  was Òthe leading  expert  on  GoetheÕs scientific writingsÓ (Hemleben, 1963, p.46) . At the time of the split with the Theosophical Society, money  had already been collected and  a  building designed by  Steiner,  primarily  as  a theatrical  space.  The  Munich  authorities denied  planning  permission  for  the  new construction  which  Steiner described  as embodying  Òa  new conception  of architectureÓ  (Steiner, 1914,  p.27).  The denial of planning permission coincided with a lecture  tour  to  Switzerland  by  Steiner.  He  was offered  vacant  land  on  a  hillside overlooking the Swiss  village of Dornach on the outskirts  of Basel. The outcome of this generosity  was  that  the Goetheanum was  built  on  the Dornach  land and  became  the headquarters of the Anthroposophical Society (Easton, 1980).\n\nIt was  this first Goetheanum building that had such an impact on Ernesto in 1920. Easton (1980, p.273) writes that Òby 1920 the building was by no means  finished ... Nevertheless\n\nby 1920 the exterior  of the Goetheanum was  finished, and the stage was  usable, even though the seats  in the auditorium were not yet in placeÓ. The first Goetheanum was  a multi-domed construction of timber with a slate roof. It burnt to the ground on New YearÕs Eve  1922/23  (Lissau,  2005).  Steiner  designed  the  second  Goetheanum  as  a  bold manifestation  of  Anthroposophic  architecture  and,  with  a  thought  to  flammability,  this second  reincarnation  was  in  reinforced  concrete.  It  is  this   second  Goetheanum  that present visitors  can  marvel at as   an architectural masterpiece, and that Ernesto would have visited on his later trips to Dornach.\n\nErnesto  married  but  it  was  not  a  happy  match.  ÒLidia  ...  the  sad  marriage.  ...  Right through they were sad years ... Lydia left at the beginning of 1924. Soon after I went to DornachÓ  (Ernesto uses  both spellings,  Lidia and  Lydia) (Genoni,  c.1955,  p.19). Lydia Hillbrand was born in Wells, Austria, she was 14 years younger than Ernesto, they had no children  together,  and  he  reported  her  living  in  London  when  he  later  applied  for Australian naturalization (Genoni, 1932b).\n\nErnesto was  at this  stage associating with Alfred Meebold (1863-1952), anthroposophist and author (e.g. 1937, 1940), and this  friendship was  later maintained by MeeboldÕs  visits to him in Australia - in both WA and Victoria.\n\nAt Dornach, Ernesto was painting, attending anthroposophy lectures, and trying to master German.  SteinerÕs  lectures  were  in  German,  and  Dornach is  in  the German-speaking region of Switzerland.\n\nIn June 1924 Steiner travelled to Koberwitz (then Germany, now Kobierzyce, Poland) and presented the eight lectures of the Agriculture Course (Steiner, 1924a, 1924c). It was   the only  time  he  presented  an  agriculture  course.  There  were  111  attendees from  six countries , Germany  (N=61),  Poland  (N=30), Austria  (N=9),  Switzerland  (N=7),  France (N=2), Sweden (N=2), with none were from Italy (Paull, 2011a), and although it seems that Ernesto was  at the Goetheanum at this  time (Genoni, c.1955)  he did not travel to attend the Koberwitz course.\n\nErnesto reports that ÒRosa and Fanny went to England to the anthroposophy gathering at Torquay [England]Ó  (Genoni, c.1955,  p.20).  It was  SteinerÕs  final trip  to  Britain  and  he sought to entrench his Waldorf education in the Anglo-world (Merry, 1924; Steiner, 1924b, 1924d).\n\nErnesto writes  cryptically of Òthe big Michael paintingÓ and he states   that ÒIn September of that year [1924] the Doctor became ill. I returned to MilanÓ (Genoni, c.1955, p.20). Steiner withdrew from public life on 28 September confined to his sick bed, and he died 30 March 1925 (Collison, 1925).\n\nÒIn Spring 1925 Caldera came to see me and persuade me to return to Australia with him. The funny assessment of the Taxation officer ... at the date I would have to pay I was  on the sea on the way to AustraliaÓ (Genoni, c.1955, pp.20-21). Ernesto was  now aged 40, and although his  vocational training was in art, he was nevertheless somewhat unsettled and  ambivalent  about  his art.  He  was  leaving  behind  a  post-war  Europe  of  mixed experiences,  where  a  lowlight  was  Òthe  sad  marriageÓ,  and  a  highlight  was   SteinerÕs Anthroposophy which nourished his spiritual cravings.\n\n## 3.8 Migration to Australia\n\nMr  Genoni will  proceed  to Melbourne, where  he  will  open  a studio  and  hold  an exhibition of his work (The Australasian, 1926, p.47).\n\nErnesto arrived in Australia,  for  the third time, in  1926, and this   time  it  could be  fairly characterized  as  an  emigration.  He  had  been  in  Europe  for  a  decade,  firstly  on  the Western Front as  a stretcher-bearer  with the AIF, then in prison and the medical corps with  the  Italian Army,  he  had  an  estranged  wife  who  refused  him a  divorce,  he  had discovered Anthroposophy under the tutelage of Rudolf Steiner, and he had tried his hand as an anthro-artist, painting in the anthroposophic style.\n\nHe brought to Australia an exhibition  of  his  art  works   and  this  was   announced  in  the Australian press  in Perth (The West Australian, 1926), Adelaide  (The Advertiser, 1926) and Melbourne (The Australasian, 1926). A Melbourne newspaper  reported that: ÒAfter remaining in Western Australia for about a month, Mr Genoni will proceed to Melbourne, where  he  will  open  a  studio  and  hold  an  exhibition  of  his  work.  He  has  made arrangements for a group of Italian artists to forward samples  of their work periodically for exhibition in Australian citiesÓ  (The Australasian, 1926, p.47). The account reported that after  serving in  the AIF  and the  Italian  army: ÒHe  then settled in  Italy and took  up his former profession as an artistÓ (The Australasian, 1926, p.47).\n\nIt seems that ErnestoÕs Plan A, the art exhibition, never materialized, nor a studio, nor the importation of contemporary Italian art works. They receive no mention at all in ErnestoÕs memoirs. The art certainly arrived and there are art works  by Ernesto in Western Australia and Victoria, and Peggy Macpherson remembers there being many paintings in his (later) Melbourne residence shared with his partner Ileen (Macpherson, 2014).\n\nFigure 4. Oil painting by Ernesto Genoni (undated).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA  handful  of oil  paintings have  been  sighted  by  the author  and  on  that  basis  it can be said that some of the art is signed  ÒE.  GenoniÓ and  some  others are unsigned  (Fig.4).  It  seems that  the  art  arrived  as flat canvasses  - which would be a  sensible choice  for the convenience  and  cost  of transport  -  and  that  it  was (or some of it was) stretched and  framed  in  Western Australia  (on the  basis  that at least  one  stretcher is labelled with the Australian branding ÒCooeeÓ. Known art includes  portraits, Italianesque landscapes and a still life.\n\nThere are at least four  reasons, that can be speculated, as  to why the exhibition never eventuated.  Firstly,  Ernesto  arrived  at  the  onset  of  a  recession  (in  Australia  and elsewhere) just before the Great Depression (Crabbe, 1989), businesses and farms were\n\nstruggling to survive, and the discretionary spend was  probably at  its  low  point for  the twentieth century. England was  the major destination for Australian agricultural exports. Prices were deflating, and agricultural wages in England had fallen by 33% from 1920 to 1926 (Ernle, 1927). Secondly, Australia had been bloodied in a hard and bitter WWI, had lost  much  of  the flower  of  its  youth to Euro-bullets  and  Euro-politics,  and now,  in  the 1920s  and 1930s, the esteem that the old-world had perhaps  enjoyed pre-WWI was now somewhat tarnished. Australians  were jaded with  Europe, the  experience of  WWI had been bitter and devastating for Australia. Thirdly, in the interbellum years  (from the end of WWI to the outbreak  of WWII) Australian art was  itself  coming of age, and to the fore, European-trained artists  and home-grown artists  had, after some mis-steps, learned to capture the light, the landscape, and the eucalypts  of  the new  continent. As   Australian artist Lloyd Rees  observed ÒAfter  the war [WWI] there was  an amazing spirit abroad in Sydney - a triumphant feeling. There was  an uprising of intense Australianism, which was not  confined  to  the  painters  but  spread  to  the  writers  as  wellÓ  (Rees,  1985,  p.112). Fourthly, there was  Ernesto himself. He was  always  a modest and self effacing man, a thinker,  a  philosopher,  and,  yes,  an  artist,  but  never  a  salesman,  a  marketer,  a  selfpromoter, nor an entrepreneur, such latter  skills  would have proven useful, and perhaps even essential, for a successful art career.\n\nThe first stop in Australia for Ernesto was  EmilioÕs  farm, Etna, in WA. As  Triaca tells  it: ÒThen came anthroposophy, the philosophy of the Austrian, Rudolf Steiner. It arrived at the GenoniÕs through their youngest brother, Ernesto ... For  the GenoniÕs  anthroposophy was like a religion with its   own shrine - the Goetheanum in Switzerland - and its own holy books  -  the  teachings  of  Rudolf  Steiner.  Ernesto  became  the  masterÕs  disciple,  his brothers  the willing  students.  They  would  have study evenings  up at Etna where they read aloud Rudolf SteinerÕs  published works  on subjects  as  diverse as  spiritualism, the education of children and physiology  and therapeutics  ... Part of it was  natural healing and organic farmingÓ (Triaca, 1985, p.116).\n\nIn 1927,  Ernesto  travelled to Melbourne,  then  Òwent  to Dalmore  [70 km south east of Melbourne] at the time Morris  and the other Italians took up the Makillic farm (Genoni, c. 1955, p.21). Farm work  was  interspersed with art: ÒI was  doing some fotography [sic] for the Sicilians. VacarriÕs pastel portraitÓ (p.21).\n\nIn terms  of leaving his mark in Australia - and in terms of Anthroposophy and biodynamic agriculture - 1928 was a key year for Ernesto. He writes that ÒIn 1928(?) I discovered Mrs Macky at the New Conservatorium [of Music]. We started some Anthroposophy meetings in Hope Street at Mrs HawkinsÕ houseÓ (Genoni, c.1955, p.21). This laid the foundations for the Anthroposophy Society in Australia, Victoria, aka the Michael Group (Macpherson, c.1990) which exists  to the present. Anne Macky was  a music composer who had, on a visit  to  Britain  in  1922,  seen  an  advertisement  for  SteinerÕs   Education  Conference  at Oxford  University  (Paull,  2011c) and  on  the  basis of the  flyer had  attended  the Conference (Bak, 1996).\n\nIn  1932,  Ernesto  was a  cofounder,  in  Melbourne,  of  the  Anthroposophy  Society  in Australia, Victoria, Michael Group, and he was  active in it for the next four decades, that is   the rest of his life. He was   from 1962 the leader of the Michael Group (Macpherson, c. 1990).\n\n## 3.9 The Agriculture Course, The Experimental Circle, and the European Grand Tour of Biodynamics\n\nIn 1930 I went to Dornach again to become acquainted with the B.D. farming (Genoni, c.1955, p.21).\n\nI n  1928  Ernesto  applied  to j oin t he Experimental  Circle of  Anthroposophical Farmers and Gardeners (ECAFG). He was the first Australian to join the Experimental Circle (Paull,  2013).  By  the  time  of  the Agriculture Course  (June  1924) Rudolf Steiner was mortally ill,  and  he  probably knew  it.  He warned the attendees  of the Course that they should  take  all  he  said  as  ÒhintsÓ,  that  they should  put  everything  to  the  test,  and  when everything was  tested it  should be  presented to the world  (1924a; 1924e,  p.10).  The Experimental  Circle  was SteinerÕs vehicle intended  to  achieve  this  outcome,  and  over time the  Circle  attracted  members from Europe, Africa, the Americas  and Australasia. When Ernesto joined the Circle these were still Ôearly  daysÕ,  the  term  ÔbiodynamicÕ  had  not been coined, and it was not until Dr Ehrenfried PfeifferÕs  1938 book  Biodynamic Farming and Gardening  that  there  was  a  Ôcoming  outÕ  of biodynamics  as  a  named  and  differentiated agriculture offering global antidote to chemical agriculture (Paull, 2011b; Pfeiffer, 1938).\n\nFigure  5.  Rudolf  SteinerÕs  Agriculture  Course (in  German)  #165  issued  to  Ernesto  Genoni; inscribed ÒHerrn Genoni (Australia)Ó.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nErnestoÕs memoir  states that Òin 1929  I received the Agriculture Course  from DornachÓ (Genoni, c.1955, p.21). His  copy of the Agriculture Course was  in German, he applied for membership of the Experimental Circle in 1928 nominating that experimental work  would be carried out at Dalmore Farm in Victoria. At this  time, the transcript of the Agriculture  Course  was  only  issued  to  members  of  the  ECAFG  and  each  copy  was numbered. ErnestoÕs copy of the Agriculture Course is inscribed as #165, and it survives to  this day  with  ErnestoÕs makeshift  reinforced  bindings along  with  his pencilled annotations (Fig.5). The first English edition of the Agriculture Course did not appear until 1929, and all subsequent Australian members  of the Experimental Circle -  including his brother  Emilio -  received typescript  English language  versions  of the  Course (and the numbers are prefaced with an ÔEÕ) (Paull, 2013).\n\nErnesto embarked on a grand tour of biodynamics  in Europe in 1930 -  Switzerland (14 June -15 July), Germany (15 July - 12 September), England (13 September - 1 October). He  declared  in  his naturalization  paperwork that the  object of  the  journey  was ÒAgricultural studiesÓ (Genoni, 1932b, p.1).\n\nErnesto states that: ÒIn 1930 I went to Dornach again to become acquainted with the B.D. farmingÓ  (Genoni,  c.1955,  p.21).  What  follows  in  his  memoir  is  a  WhoÕs  Who  of  the\n\nleading practitioners  and advocates  of biodynamics  in Europe at the time: Ò[Ehrenfried] Pfeiffer  ...  [Erika]  Riese ...  Count  Lerchenfeld  ...  [Ernst]  Stegemann  at  Marienhšhe  ... [Erhard] Bartch near Berlin ... [Max] Schwarz near Bremen ... London with [Carl] Mirbt ... Return  to  the  continent  via  Holland,  [Ehrenfried]  Pfeiffer  Farm  at  Rosendale  ...  Then Dornach and then Marseilles where we [Ernesto &amp; Fred] embark on the Ville dÕAmiens for AustraliaÓ (pp.21-22).\n\nIt  seems  likely  that  on  such  a  seriously  and  thoughtfully  constructed  study  tour  that Ernesto would have documented and recorded his experience - given that he had been a tertiary student for five years, that he later wrote a memoir, and that the objective of this study tour was educational, and was to capture for himself and his New World colleagues the  practices and  the lessons learned in Europe  for anthroposophic  farming. Anthroposophic farming was  later called Ôbiodynamic farmingÕ and ÔbiodynamicsÕ, thereby satisfying SteinerÕs injunction to decouple the practices from Anthroposophy and to let his new  agriculture  stand  on  its  own merits.  Travel notebook/s  of  Ernesto  have not  been uncovered by the present author, but if they existed, they were likely valued by Ernesto and we could be optimistic that they may still surface.\n\nErnestoÕs  1932 Application for  Naturalization followed  close  on the  heels   of his  return from  the  BD  trip  to  Europe.  His reason  for  applying  for  naturalization  is  stated  as ÒPermanent residence and desires full citizenshipÓ and the application stated that he was in good health (Nuschell, 1932).\n\nÒBack  to Etna with  Fred. He  soon proceeds  for  Victoria while  I  remain at  Etna till the beginning of 1933Ó (Genoni, c.1955, p.22). Australia, and the world, or at least AustraliaÕs major agricultural trading partners, were still in the midst  of the Depression and this  hit Australian  farmers hard.  Ernesto  reported a  second  visit by Alfred  Meebold, anthroposophist and biodynamicist. Ernesto writes  of ÒThe attempt to do BD. We bought cows and sent cream to the Butter Factory - rearing pigs  with wheat and skimmed milk. Made insilage ... during winter  was  fed to the sheep. We grew blue peas  and lupinsÓ (p. 22).\n\nHowever: ÒThe Bank closed in and the farm got near bankruptcyÓ (Genoni, c.1955, p.22). This was the end of ErnestoÕs  Western Australia adventures. He writes that ÒAngelo from Melbourne offered  me the  Dalmore farm  to manage.  Went  to  Victoria once  more and started at Dalmore. We build the little houseÓ (p.23).\n\nAt this  stage  Ernesto  is  in his  late  forties. ÒStarted  to  go  again  to  the Anthroposophy meetings  in Collins  Street. This  is  where  I met first  Ileen and Mrs  R[uby] Macpherson. The letter from Ileen and our first meeting in Dandenong ... Our  meetings  then become more frequentÓ (Genoni, c.1955, p.23).\n\nAt this  point meteorology intervenes.  ÒThe  flood destroyed everything  at the  [Dalmore] farm. Then the idea arose of starting a B.D. farm with Ileen in Dandenong. My meetings with the Macpherson Family in Punt Road. - Then the farm on the highway was bought. I started working there living in a tent and boarding with Mrs ArmorÓ (p.23).\n\nIn his  memoirs  Ernesto only  states  one date with precision. He writes  that  ÒOn the 14 March 1935 Ileen came to live at the farmÓ (Genoni, c.1955, p.23). He is  aged 49. He reports  that  ÒThe crop paddock  was  plowed up and the first  crop  of  peas  without  any\n\nmanure was  put in ... The miserable peas  crop ... got stable manure wherever we could get it. The  next  10 acres  near  the creek  were bought and later  Mr  Mehan 19 acres  ... Fred  comes  to  work  ...  Mr  Meebold  comes  to  stay  for  a  fortnight  at  the  farm  ...  The unhappy  struggling for  making a B.D  farm. The sales  of  vegetables  on the  roadÓ  (pp. 23-24).\n\nAlways the restless  soul, Ernesto records  that ÒI am planning to go to Europe, but Ileen gets  sick  and is  sent  to hospital in Brighton. Eventually she is  returning home. Again in 1938  I  am  planning  to go  to  Europe  with  the  understanding  that  Ileen  should followÓ  (Genoni,  c.1955,  p.24).  He  leaves  alone on  a  German freighter  Òwith only  one other  traveller. A poor  trip!Ó (p.25). Perhaps   the goal of the trip was  to seek  a divorce, in any  event  he records  that ÒMet  again  Lydia  .... a further  attempt to get  a  divorce,  but unsuccessful. Gone to Dornach ... the dark  clouds of war are gathering over Europe ... I left for Australia in June or July 1939Ó (p.25). This was Ernesto's final trip to Europe.\n\nWhen he returned from Europe: ÒAt the farm I found things  with Ileen not too good ... World War II. We carried on the milk contract ... up to March 1940 ... Ileen carried on the milking ... but her legs begin to give awayÓ (Genoni, c.1955, p.25).\n\nÒMrs  Macpherson bought  for  me the block  in Namur  Street ... Ileen is  sent  to hospital again ... But gradually her legs  are getting worse. She had to be taken to hospital but it was too late; she could not walk anymoreÓ (Genoni, c.1955, pp.25-26).\n\nFrom hospital ÒIleen returns  to the  farm where we  live together. In 1952  we decide to build the new house in Namur St. In September 1953 Ileen comes to the new home and in March 1954 the farm is soldÓ (Genoni, c.1955, p.26). Ernesto is by now aged 69 years. Ileen was by this time wheelchair bound and Ernesto was  her carer (Macpherson, 2014). The records  of  the Anthroposophy  Society  at  Dornach have  ErnestoÕs  address  as  17 Namur  St,  Noble  Park,  Victoria  from  December  1954  through  to  his  death  in  1975 (Sekretariat, 1924-1975).\n\nThe final paragraph in Ernesto's  memoir  is  ÒFrom the beginning of  1952 we  have the monthly study of the Leading Thoughts  at the central Group, while since 1944 we have meetings in Avoca St and Sandringham and then at Kooyong RdÓ (p.26).\n\n## 4 Conclusion\n\nErnesto Genoni was a modest man, a restless soul, a seeker, an artist, a WWI volunteer, a  conscientious  objector, a  theosophist,  a pioneering  anthroposophist  in Australia,  the pioneering biodynamic farmer in Australia, a man of unrealized dreams, and a devoted partner  of Ileen Macpherson. He lived through the tumultuous  times  of WWI, the Great Depression, and WWII. This  is  the first account of his  life other  than an account of his Somme experience and a conference presentation earlier  this  year and (Paull, 2014b, 2014c). A future account of his life may benefit from some further discovery of letters and correspondence, notes, artworks, and photographs, and perhaps, as well, the memoirs of others,  at  least  some  of  which  may  have  survived  the  ravages  of  time  and  loss  of provenance and which were not available for the present account.\n\nThere are many Ôwhat ifsÕ that arise from the present account. Ernesto was  known in the family as  Òthe artistÓ  (E. Negri, 1984, p.5; Triaca, 1985,  p.89) and he had five years  art training at the prestigious  Brera Academy in Milan. Yet when he volunteered in the AIF he\n\nhad his  occupation as ÒlabourerÓ (AIF, 1916a, p.1) - if he had been more forthright might he have been a Australian war artist? Decades  later when he applied for naturalization he had  is   occupation  as  ÒfarmerÓ  (Genoni,  1932b,  p.1).  Ernesto  was  always   somewhat ambivalent about his  art.  When  he  returned  to  Australia  from Europe  after  a  decade away, he announced  a forthcoming art  exhibition.  This  plan  was  scuppered  by  some combination  of  ErnestoÕs  own  reticence, the  economic recession and  the onset of  the Great Depression, and perhaps  the lack  of sibling support whose skills were agricultural. It  is  unclear  if  Ernesto  ever  made that  challenging  transition  from  Euro-style  artist  to Australian artist - a path travelled with some success by, for example, British trained artist John Glover (Hansen, 2003), German trained artist Eugene von GuŽrard (Pullin, 2011), and mastered by Australian-trained artist Hans Heysen (Hylton &amp; Neylon, 2004).\n\nIn 1926 Ernesto was  announcing a planned exhibition of his  art so it is  quite possible, perhaps  likely,  that  a  distributed  exhibition  of  his  works  still exists.  There  are  at  least works  known (to the author) to exist in Victoria and Western Australia, and there is  the prospect of the survival of some works  in Italy and perhaps Switzerland. Perhaps at some future time ErnestoÕs 1926-planned exhibition can materialize?\n\nWhat if  Ernesto  had emigrated to Australia  at  some time other  than in  the midst of a recession? Would his planned art exhibition had been realized, would there have been a future as an artist?\n\nWhat if his  estranged wife, Lydia, had agreed to a divorce instead of refusing? Divorce was forbidden to Catholics which may account for her refusal. AustraliaÕs current no-fault divorce following twelve months  separation was  not introduced until The Family Law Act of 1975. Would Ernesto have married Ileen? Started a family?\n\nWhat if the AIF had not turned Ernesto over to the Italians? Had turned a blind eye to the request for the handover? The handover was  ethically rather dubious  given that Ernesto had volunteered for the AIF whereas the Italians  were conscripting him off the battlefields of France. Australians  were antagonistic  to the idea of conscription, voting against it in two WWI referenda (Scott, 1936). Or what if the cogs of the Italian, British and Australian bureaucracy had not turned so fast, so accurately and so efficiently? The upside of the Italian conscription was  that Ernesto survived the war, he was  evacuated from the most dangerous killing fields of  WWI,  and  his life  expectancy  was restored  from  the abbreviated life expectancy of a stretcher-bearer on the Somme.\n\nWhat if  Ernesto had written  -  of  course perhaps  he did -  accounts  of  his  time  at  the Goetheanum with Rudolf Steiner (1920-1924), and of his  grand tour  of biodynamics  in Europe  in  1930?  Triaca  has  written  that:  ÒIn  those  days  we  used  postcards  all  the timeÓ  (1985,  p.79),  and  this  leaves  open  some  hope  that  caches  of  correspondence between Ernesto and his family, Ileen, Meebold, and other associates may have survived.\n\nFor  the  time  being,  the  present  account  reports  what  is  known  of  the  life  of  Ernesto Genoni,  former theosophist  and  pioneering  anthroposophist,  who  in  1928  brought biodynamics to Australia and co-founded the Anthroposophy Society in Victoria. It was a life of adventure and misadventure, of trailblazing, of struggle, of disappointment, and of spiritual reflection.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThank you to the individuals  and organisations that have assisted the development of this research,  including  the  Sekretariat  of the  Anthroposophical  Society,  Goetheanum, Dornach, Switzerland, the Archives of the Goetheanum (Dokumentation am Goetheanum Bibliothek  Kunstsammlung Archiv), the Australian National Archives, Canberra, Dr  Paul Genoni,  Dr  Paolo  Baracchi of  the  Italian  Historical  Society,  Melbourne,  Greg Holly  of Broomehill,  Margaret  Garner,  Peggy  Macpherson,  Anita  Sharpe,  Pam  Martin,  the Anthroposophical Society in Australia Victorian Branch, the Michael Centre, Jan BakerFinch, General  Secretary  of  the  Anthroposophical  Society in  Australia,  and  Greg Accornero and Carla Deiana for translations.\n\n## References\n\n- AIF.
