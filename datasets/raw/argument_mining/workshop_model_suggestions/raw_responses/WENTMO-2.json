On the contrary, \"we\" (i.e. human her life) already proved to possess some understanding of merely by being what and who we are. We have no trouble in grasping the meaning that   either imply are formed in sentences containing \"to be and its conjugations. And yet 'we\" (ie. philosophy and philosophers in the tradition of Western thinking since Plato) do not have sufficient philosophical that could offer a comprehensive account of As human beings we are always already acquainted and familiar with but as philosophers we do not even understand the significance of its question without further   ado A first step to overcome this ontological lacuna would be to explicitly articulate our practical or   pre-ontological   understanding  of in   philosophical   terms, thus paving way into ontology not by means of interrogating formal aspects of what there is and can be demonstrated to exist; but by questioning the very meaning of \"to be\" in the first place. Heidegger' contribution to ontology consists in tirelessly advocating the need for sufficient understanding of this question; often put forward by uncovering implicit ontological presuppositions in previous Western thinking; and mostly   articulated in a way the tradition and   traditional philosophical language. Heidegger Being. will things every being living have Being theory Being. being; Being\n\nThe outlined asymmetry between the pre-ontological and ontological understanding performed by \"us marks the hermeneutical approach of Heidegger' early thinking:\n\n\"we\" does not merely serve as rhetorical   expression For once, the   pronoun address the reader where other options would have been more that attempts to of methodological significance out of the fact that elegant. Heidegger makes point philosophical activity is an accomplishment of human practice (Heidegger 1962: 33; As human beings cannot just be described as entities occurring in the world 2008: 3) others, but must be seen as creatures that are occupied with the way perform of human life and does not come along as sophisticated  additive daily pursuits hermeneutical sense provides an interpretative explication Ontology in Heidegger's have already proven to have mastered. of the occupancy with being that humans Thus understood, ontology is a \"hermeneutic of facticity\" (2008) that; growing from factical life itself, interprets the ways in which humans exercise their understanding This peculiar circularity legitimizes the priority of the human being as Dasein, of being. as \"that entity which in principle is to be interrogated beforehand as to its arguably fundamental endeafor analysis must thus start out questioning the way human beings vor ontological are as to their capability of being. they\n\nThis chapter attempts to present the core of Heidegger' s concern with the meaning of Being as it has been worked out in Being and Time and related texts. In simplifying the matter for reasons of clarity I will distinguish three different senses of Being, namely   categorial,   existential and temporal   being, that taken   together   provide an of the meaning of Being,  according to Heidegger. As 1 believe that one account underestimate the significance of Aristotle in Heidegger's project I will use cannot Aristotle's ontology as a contrast that might highlight the innovative peculiarities of approach to questioning the meaning of Being. Heidegger' s\n\nIn other words, Heidegger's hermeneutical   version of phenomenology wants to ontology back to its very origin; which does not involve timeless conception trace of of the divine but concerns actual human life in its being-in-the-world, nature or in concrete and situated existence. It is the task of philosophy as phenomenology ie. uncover this origin and thus question the very meaning of Being. In doing, to does not only claim to recall the need to deal with forgotten Heidegger' s approach subject that is otherwise lacking in ontological investigations. QuestionOr overseen the meaning of Being via an analytic of human life or Dasein just is \"fundamental ing (Heidegger 1962: 34, 61-62), i.e. philosophical investigation prior to any in Being   and with to its method, subject matter and systematic function in the fol Time \"Philosophy is universal phenomenological ontology, and takes its lowing passage: from the hermeneutic of Dasein, which, as an analytic of existence, has at the where it arises and which it returns\" (62). to regard point\n\n## Categoriality\n\nAristotle saw the innovative potential of formal ontology that the later Plato's Sophist had indicated. The question of being is to be followed up by an analysis of language\n\n(logos) as the \"clue for obtaining access to that which really is'\" (Heidegger 1962: 196), which leads to a set of categories rather than cosmographic hierarchy of forms The word 'category goes back to the Greek kategoreîn, meaning to state or to predicate, hence our use of   propositional   language for   disclosing: Propositional language (i.e. the speech act of assertion (logos apophantikos)) seems to deserve the primary function in corresponding analysis because  it contains truth claim (Aristotle 1950-52: On Interpretation; ch. 4, 17a 4-5). Hence Aristotle can express the straightforward connection between an analysis of language   and theory about 'the kinds of essential being are precisely those that are indicated by the figures of predication; for the senses of 'being' are just as many as these figures\" (Aristotle 1950-52: Metaphysics; bk 5, ch. 7, 1017a 22-23). Categories classify the range of possible entities according to the most general and simple kinds, rendering the formal genera of anything that can be asserted in predicative sentences or assertions. According to Aristotle, anything that is is either substance Or a quantity, quality, relation, etc. (Aristotle 1950-52: Categories; ch. 4, Ib 25-27). The Categories encompasses ten of those kinds, but it does not seem to be of the utmost importance to Aristotle whether or not this list is exhaustive. The distinction between the first category and all the other categories; however, is of central importance; it is ousia, traditionally translated as substance that is in a strict sense, whereas anything classified under the other categories only is because of the being of substance; as those categories denote properties that ultimately to be thought of as properties of a substance. In his Metaphysics Aristotle explains this point with regard to the semantics of the very word \"being;' as there are 'many senses in which thing may be said to 'be\"\" (Aristotle 1950-52: Metaphysics; bk 4, ch2, 1003a 33) These different senses of 'being\" can neither be reduced to each other nor subsumed under single universal kind of Being that would entail these senses as its specifications, but do not seem to be purely equivocal or homonymous either as are all said with to a \"focal meaning' (Owen 1986) of being, to which all the other senses are somehow analogous. Aristotle is not clear about just how this analogous (analogia entis in medieval terminology) which is neither generic nor purely nominal, can be explained, though he is nonetheless certain about the focal point of any understanding   and verbal   articulation of what is, namely substance (ousia). Hence; Aristotelian ontology by and is ousiology; ie. an investigation of substance. being: have being they they regard unity large\n\nHeidegger' project of Being and Time was initially supposed to be a book on Aristotle; a book that would present Aristotle from phenomenological perspective as a phenomenologist avant la lettre. Heidegger concedes that 'ousia is the expression for the basic concept per se of Aristotelian philosophy\" (Heidegger 2009: 17). But what does that mean? What exactly do we understand when we claim substantial being to be prior to Or the focus of any other   being? What was Aristotle's phenomenal basis when coining this particular terminology? How are we to understand it? How can the analogous of being be explained? And in light of these questions, is \"substance an appropriate   translation of 'ousia\" anyway? As our introductory remarks have indicated, these questions are not just of historical interest. They reflect basic philosophical concepts (like \"substance, \"truth, 'subject, etc.) by tracing their meaning back to their original   experiential   background in unity\n\nlifeworld. Heidegger is very attentive to this kind of conceptual historical concrete analysis; and at times claims it to be of pivotal methodological importance under the heading of \"destruction of the traditional content of ancient ontology' (Heidegger a 1962: 44; 1998: 3; 2008: 59-60). In no less than six lecture courses between 1921 and 1925, which are now all published in separate books, Heidegger works through these questions before finally presenting the systematic outcome of his encounter   with Aristotle in the analysis of Dasein's being-in-the-world in the first part of Being and Time (see Volpi 1984, 1994; Sheehan 1988; Taminiaux 1989; Brogan 1994, 2005) The upshot with to categorial being and its focus on the concept of ousia are the following points: regard\n\n- (1) Propositional language and assertion (logos apophantikos) facilitate the pointing out of something as something: Its subject-predicate-structure isolates a particular fact or circumstance and thus brings it forth as such, as something that has come into view and may be the object of theoretical attention. However, it would be wrong to claim that we cognitive access to the stated fact via our assertiveness. This is not because we need epistemic contact with an object prior to subsequent assertion referring to this object; and it is not because we have to see particular color of a car before we are able to state its color correctly, or, to use an example of Heidegger's, to weigh a hammer before we are entitled to state that it is too heavy. It is because any particular circumstance is part of an environment that we already have to understand to begin with, which makes it possible for us to interpret a colored car as a case of a perceivable   object piece of equipment as being   inappropriate   for the relevant task\\_ Assertion is \"not capable of disclosing entities in general in primary way: on the contrary it always maintains itself on the basis of Being-inthe world\" (Heidegger 1962: 199). Prior to the level of propositional language is the \"fore-structure and its concrete   situational interpretation (Auslegung); prior to the predicative or 'apophantic as (some thing as something) is the 'hermeneutic as (something interpreted as something in light of its relevant environment (Heidegger 2010: 120; 1962: 199-200)) Heidegger is not always clear concerning the sense in which the hermeneutic as-structure of interpretation relates to language (see Okrent 1991; Lafont 2000). But his point is that an ontology built on propositional language Or   assertions must  fail, as it misconstrues Dasein's  primordial  holistic   disclosure of its being-in-the-world (see Dreyfus 1991; critically Brandom 1983; Tugendhat 1982) Categories understood as the most general formal classifications of that which is must be founded on our pre-predicative understanding of the world\\_ gain stated\n2. The \"clue for obtaining access to that which really is\" has to be found in Dasein's practical   comportment and agency in everydayness Heidegger' s famous   phenomenological   analysis of the worldliness of Dasein  (Heidegger 1962: S815-18) shows the disclosedness of the world in understanding, urging a rethinking of intentionality that is not concerned with subject's conscious directedness to an isolated object; but with Dasein's projecting and holistic transcendence in terms of care. This revision implies different take on how\n\nthe givenness of the world and its entities must be conceived of ontologically . Items given in practical comportment are merged in the context of significance that organizes their use in functional structures ('toward-which, \"in-order-to of a piece of equipment ultimately pointing to \"for-the-sake-of\"' that refers to Heidegger 1962: 120; see Okrent   1991), which only appear as singular entities or objects on the basis of a primary practical invol vement. Those items are characterized not as occurring or 'present-at-hand = (vorhanden), but as 'ready-to-hand\" (zuhanden). Heidegger concludes this analysis with to categorial being by claiming that 'readiness-to-hand is the way in which entities as are 'in themselves' are defined ontologico-categorially\" (Heidegger 1962: 101). Talking about things in terms of objects that may have practical use in specific situations due to their distinctive properties proves to be a derivative way of presenting the ontological phenomenon, as it implies the priority of a theoretical givenness of things. It is rather the other way around the theoretical perspective that allows the singling out of objects   and their properties relies on pre-theoretical   and non-thematic givenness of worldly entities in practical circumspection. As Heidegger translates ousia with presence (Anwesenheit) or presence-at-hand   (Vorhandenheit) , this   argument attacks the Aristotelian claim of ousia as being the primary focus of all ontological concern. Heideggerian phenomenology thus designates readiness-to-hand (or availableness (Dreyfus 1991)) as the primary sense of being of those entities that are not Dasein. The category of presence-at-hand (occurrence) denotes derivative, secondary sense of Against Aristotle and the priority of substance to accidence, Heidegger thus conceives of categoriality in terms of availableness prior to occurrence. regard they\n\n## Existentiality\n\nWhereas categorial being relates to the sense of being that determines our understanding of the world and its entities, existential being refers to the we are, ie. to the sense of our own being. After the philosophy of Descartes, the arrival of psychology (including such different attempts as the Neo-Kantianism of Natorp and the existentialist   approach of   Jaspers),   Dilthey's   philosophy of   life  (despite its criticism of scientific objectivism (Heidegger 1962: 252)), Husserls analysis of personality  deposited in the manuscripts of Ideas II (to which Heidegger had access (1962: 73n)) and 126-28), modern epistemology simply underestimates the necessity of posing the question as to the very being of a subject or a person from the first-person perspective \\_ have more or less adopted the traditional ontology of reality (i.e. categorial being) as the blueprint for existence: Heidegger raises reservations on several occasions against epistemological approaches like Descartes who \"left undetermined the kind of which belongs to the res cogitans, or more precisely the meaning of the of the 'sum' (Heidegger 1962: 46), or Kant, who \"failed to give a pre ontological   analytic of the subjectivity of the subject\" (45). His scruples even apply to Husserl who   according to Heidegger   neglects to reflect on the way They Being Being liminary\n\nmeaning of being of intentionality in a proper analysis (Heidegger 1992b: 129) and follows Descartes in his conception of certitudo instead, taking Being as such to mean \"being possible object for science in general\" (Heidegger 2005a: 203)\n\nIn Being and Time the distinction between the \"is and the am sense of being is ontologically   conceptualized as the distinction between categorial   and existential being, i.e. between basic characterization of the being of worldly entities expressed in categories vs. the basic characterization of the being of Dasein expressed as existentials or existentialia (Heidegger 1962: 70). Existentials (notably \"understanding,' 'state-of-mind and \"falling, which constitute the three-part structure of care (Heidegger 1962: 235 41)) are characters of being-in-the-first-person that hence cannot be extracted from categorial being. They articulate the structural aspects of Dasein's disclosing being in its practical comportment in everydayness and are thus gained from the phenomenological analysis of Dasein's being-in-the-world. But why is it that one must distinguish between categorial and existential being in the first place?\n\nAccording to Heidegger, what is needed is an ontology of the first person, of conceiving philosophy of existence that can genuinely cope its subject way (ie. existence) with phenomenological adequacy. This task, however, cannot draw on rich ontological tradition, let alone corresponding terminology; it has been partly anticipated but not systematically elaborated in branches of the Platonist religious tradition from St Paul and St Augustine, through Master Eckhart and Luther , to Kierkegaard \\_ A proper ontology of existence has not been developed, as Heidegger complains early on: \"Existence can be understood as a certain manner of being and thus as particular sense of 'is' that 'is, ise. has the essential sense of the am. And we have this (I) 'am in genuine sense, not through thinking about it in theoretical manner, but rather by enacting the am, which is a way of being that belongs to the being of the 'I' Living in this kind of experience; and gearing to its very sense 1 am able to question after the sense of my 'I am (Heidegger 1998: 25). This passage expresses what existential being is about: The meaning of Being rendered in \"I am Note that Heidegger highlights the am, not the \"1\" his  focus is on what   being subject means, which does not involve an explicit understanding of an ego or an \"1\" to begin with (Heidegger 1962: 367-68; 1988: 158-59) with myself\n\nHeidegger argument unfolds the peculiar logic of human individuation from an ontological perspective: \"We are ourselves the entities to be analyzed. The Being of any such entity is in each case mine. These entities, in their Being, comport themselves towards their Being. As entities with such Being, they are delivered over to their own Being. is that which is an issue for every such entity' (Heidegger 1962: 67). Things ontologically classified by categorial distinctions are what are according to their essence or species, or rather, according to their purposefulness and function in practical dealings. Existing beings (plainly: human beings), however, are never just tokens of a certain type. A person does not experience her being as a particular item of natural or functional kind, though physician or an anthropologist might see her in just this third-person perspective: The Being of existence is distributed individually and irrevocably; it is characterized by its individual moment and its individual address, something that Heidegger describes in somewhat artificial language as Jeweiligkeit (\"particular whileness\") (see Kisiel 1993: 500) and Jemeinigkeit (\"in each case mineness or just 'mineness ) Being they actual beginning is not at our individual disposal this characterizes our 'thrownness or \"facticity' we are nonetheless   occupied  with it as our own project, which characterizes it as 'projection Or 'existentiality\" in a narrower sense (235). \"Factical existence\" thus marks the mode of being of Dasein (236).\n\nExistential being implies an individual responsibility of the existing entity for the way it is. This responsibility is not ethical in the sense that it applies to other persons, to moral Or Or towards social or religious institutions. It is rather ontological, as it responds to the open project and the fact of being one's own individual being that must be prior to any ontic\" responsibility. Notice that the phenomenological   analysis is neither   interested in nor capable of elaborating   particular   individual or collective life forms that would serve as role models in order to exist \"the right way or \"the most authentic way, as if there was pre-established   individual   life  plan one could succeed Or fail to up to. Although it makes sense to talk about authentic being\" ~being aware of the \"mineness\" of each case of being a human being one cannot merely choose to be or become authentic in this ontological sense, as one, given certain conditions, can choose to become a carpenter or mother . The claim put forward with the notion of 'authentic being\" is simply that Dasein in all its comportment no matter how selfish or   altruistic, focused Or chaotic, rebellious Or anonymous ~is ultimately concerned with its own being. Heidegger' s phenomenological analysis of conscience (Heidegger 1962: 8855-59) is designed to give evidence to this claim, presenting conscience as the very phenomenon that discloses the responsiveness of any individual Dasein towards its own being to itself. What the \"call of conscience' reveals is thus not a personal towards a system of normatively sanctioned preferences, but the formal condition for being capable of taking responsibility for any such system in the first place (Crowell 2001) live guilt\n\nHence existence serves not as another word for 'reality, as it does not refer to the actuality of a specified entity but to the project of an individualized being, Dasein, whose being is an issue for it. This means that its being is something that has to be accomplished or achieved, although it cannot be paused or undone. Its reais its being-possible, as existence is never to be thought of as a process of mere realization, but as an ongoing openness without fixed telos. Dasein understands ontological status than actuality, as it has usually been considered in Western metaphysics from Aristotle to Hegel. On the contrary, 'possibility as an existentiale is the most  primordial   and ultimate  positive way in which Dasein is characterized ontologically\" (183). Existential being thus urges ontology to think of possibility as being-possible, not as being-not-yet-actualized. It introduces possible-being as a primary ontological mode in its own right that does justice to the way human beings qua Dasein are. lity\n\nIt should be added that even though existential being refers to the way Being is distributed to the individual Dasein, it is not conceived of as individualistic. Dasein is essentially together with other Dasein, togetherness that cannot be captured in terms of either occurrentness or availableness   and must be thought of as \"Beingwith\" (Heidegger 1962: 154). This means that Heidegger acknowledges sociality as an existential , dimension that   primordially determines any understanding of one's\n\nbeing even before actually acting or communicating with other people; \"The world of Dasein is a with-world\" (155) However, as sociality thus becomes a part of my understood as our common, in fact mostly anonymously shared being-in-the-world, it becomes difficult to conceive of the Other as the Other. Heidegger's approach incorporates dimension of intersubjectivity in terms of   sociality  (enabling the thinking of collective historical identities in terms of \"the They\" das Man\") \"a people, \"a generation, \"destiny;' etc. (Heidegger 1962: 437-38); (see Dreyfus and Rabinow 1993)), but not in terms of ethics (Levinas 1969). To put this point differently by drawing further on the syntax of being: The meaning of Being  according to Heidegger can be   phenomenologically described in third-person and first-person perspectives, respectively, presented here as categorial and existential being. What is lacking in this approach is the sense of ('you') are; ie. the second-person perspective that is pivotal in ethical thinking from Buber to Levinas.\n\n## Temporality\n\n\"In contrast to all our treatment of the question of the meaning of Being must enable us to show that the central problematic of all ontology is rooted in the phenomenon of time In the exposition of the problematic of Temporality the question of the meaning of Being  will first What Aristotle had suggested he had found in the notion of ousia, Heidegger obviously claims to present in the proper problematic of time, namely the ground or the soil in which the unity of the different senses of Being are rooted. However, the claim that Being itself has temporal character does not refer to the fact that anything that happens in time and is subjected to change and decay. Such 'vulgar conception only extends the ontology of occurrentness to temporal dimension that   itself proves to be derivative in origin. Heidegger wants to show that any understanding of Being is in fact founded in Dasein's prior understanding of its own temporal being (cf: Blattner 2005). If this foundationalist claim of the meaning of Being as rooted in temporal being is true, then one must be able to trace an understanding of temporality as basic condition for the understanding of Being in the ontological theories of Western metaphysics\\_ Heidegger therefore sees the need for a revision or destruction of Western ontological thinking with regard to its (implicit or explicit) understanding of time on the basis of the phenomenological analytic of Dasein's temporality. These two   steps (a) uncovering   temporal   being as the ultimate   ground of Dasein's understanding of and (b) uncovering temporality as the actual origin of Western thinking about Being hitherto represent the two parts of the project of Being and Time; project that Heidegger never brought to completion. this, Being;\n\nHeidegger interpretation of Aristotle and categorial being shows precisely on what grounds the destructive interpretation should have been performed. As it was above, for Aristotle the analysis of propositional language provides the ing line and method for ontological analysis. The conceptual background, however; in Heidegger' terminology sense of Being) along with the pre-conception (predetermining the relevant terminology) of Aristotle's ontology (Heidegger 1992a: 367), stems from the realm of practical doing: guidargued\n\n\"the object-field which provides the primordial sense of Being is the object-field of those objects which are produced and used in dealings. Being means being-produced\" (374-75). Heidegger thus claims the implicit conceptual background of Aristotelian ontology to be poiesis (production; manufacture). It is no coincidence; therefore, that the 'guiding example\" to explain the becoming of natural entities in the Physics and Metaphysics is the \"coming-to-be of statue from bronze\" (390). Following pre conception of in terms of poiesis, what really is has come to its end or ultimate destination in its process of manufacturing, just as the building of a house is finished when its plan (its eidos in the sense of Aristotle) is accomplished. It is then present as what it is and can hence be identified as a definite entity that is able to persist on its own.  Categorial being understood in light of the paradigm of poiesis thus means \"1. primarily present, presence; 2. being-complete, completeness\" (2009: 26) Being being\n\nIt now becomes evident why it is of pivotal   importance to   interrogate the phenomenological background for Aristotle's conceptuality. It is due to the paradigm of poiesis that Aristotelian ontology and hence Western  ontological thinking as whole has come to identify being with actuality in terms of being-present. The critical or \"destructive\" interpretation of Aristotle takes its point of departure in the simple question of whether this paradigm is appropriate. Given that any ontology must originate in Dasein's understanding of its temporal is it convincing to think of the being of Dasein in terms of poiesis? As our considerations regarding existential being have already indicated, it is not. Simply put; Heidegger believes that this first beginning of Western  metaphysics in Aristotelian   ontology went awry as it was founded on paradigm that was not extracted from a proper articulation of human existence after all, leading to the ontological hegemony of presence and actuality being,\n\nTo sum up, categoriality displays its conceptual origin in human life (ontologically understood) in light of the paradigm of poiesis as the 'basic category that dominates throughout the Aristotelian ontology' (Heidegger 1992a: 390; translation modified according to 2005b: 394) This implies actuality (energeia, the movement that has come to an end in completeness) and presence (parousia as synonymous with ousia, as Heidegger frequently adds) (2009: 25; 1962: 47).\n\nAristotle's own description of the openness of human agency and praxis in the Nicomachean Ethics already pointed towards different direction, as praxis cannot be said to have a final result of completeness compatible with artifacts and products as life (eudaimonia) Heidegger' s own of understanding, the 'projection towards one's own possibilities, the \"Being-towards-death,= and ultimately the formal moment of \"ahead-of-itself-Being\" in care (1962: 237). These projective phenomena all indicate primacy of the dimension of future rather than presence. While Dasein' s temporality is characterized by an intricate jointure of all three dimensions of time, it is the future tense, Dasein's projective being-ahead of itself, which is primary in relation to presence and past tense; \"the primary meaning of existentiality is the future (376) good phe-\n\nAs indicated above, Heidegger claims there is a foundational hierarchy between what I have called temporal,\n\nAs summary of the discussion far , Table 28.1 contrasts Aristotle's and Heidegger' s projects.\n\n## THOMAS SCHWARZ WENTZER\n\nTable 28.1 Aristotle's and Heidegger's ontologies\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                            | Aristotle's ontology                             | Heidegger' s fundamental ontology                                       |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Guiding clue                                                                                                                                                               | Propositional language                           | Dasein's dealings in everyday praxis                                    |\n| Type of investigation Basic conceptions Constitutive focus Worldly objects primarily taken as Conceptual background (fore-having and pre-conception) Primary temporal mode | Theory of predication Categories Ousia Occurrent | Analytic of existence Existentials and categories Temporality Available |\n\nallows for an explanation of Aristotelian ontology in terms of fundamental ontology In Being   and Time this foundational hierarchy is articulated in terms of Kantian transcendentalism, enabling Heidegger to speak of temporal being as the condition of possibility or the transcendental horizon for our understanding of existential being and categorial being. Heidegger thus does not present different conception that competes with the Aristotelian approach; he rather claims to have explained what Aristotle's ontological theory is really about and where it gets its phenomenological basis. Since this basis proves to be derivative, Aristotelian ontology must be revisited and repeated, but now under the guidance of an authentic basis provided by the analytic of existence. And as Aristotle's ontological thinking has to be regarded as the implicit and unquestioned paradigm of Western philosophy up until Husserl, this tradition has to undergo what Heidegger terms \"phenomenological destruction. Questioning the meaning of Being is thus a  way to think of philosophy all over from its very first beginning. again\n\nSee also Martin Heidegger (Chapter 4); Truth (Chapter 14); The subject and the self Methods in phenomenology after Husserl (Chapter 25); Art and aesthetics (Chapter 26); of language (Chapter 37); Philosophy of science (Chapter 42); Existentialism (Chapter 44); Hermeneutics   (Chapter 45); Literary criticism (Chapter 58)\n\n## References\n\nWorks   of Aristotle, 12   vols, ed.
