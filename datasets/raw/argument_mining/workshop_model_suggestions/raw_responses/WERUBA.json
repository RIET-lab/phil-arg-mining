Wade\n\nRoger Wertheimer\n\nWe need not resolve  the dificult question of when theology are unable to arrive at any consensus, the judiciary, at this in the development of man's knowledge, is not in position to speculate as to the answer 1 point\n\n'HESE words of Justice Blackmun, speaking for the majority in Roe v Wade, bid fair to be among the most oft-quoted sentences of any Supreme  Court Their   fame derives   from their de fined the pivotal   premises for that all would deem and many would damn as apocalyptic. But an aura of infamy now round them, for to many trained minds seem, in context, has many friends, virtually all of them seem embarrassed by this particular  reasoning; scholarly with explanations notably independent of\\_if not inconsistent  with\\_any argument in which those propositions figure? And embarrassment has tumed to chagrin as socalled pro-life advocates have interpreted those words as license to undermine the by means of congressional legislation or constitutional amendment. In brief, Blackmun's judicial has induced every condition from perplexity to apoplexy, except ataraxy: having opinion: epochal ruling they hangs ruling ruling ruling epoche\n\nThough I shall later list some of my misgivings with other of the Blackmun opinion, my main message is that the greatest shortcomof those two notorious sentences is that there are only two of them. Whereas the claims proffer are correct and consistent with the rest of the opinion; some of the structure of suppositions requisite for understanding Blackmun's reasoning is neither obvious nOI asserted, parts ing they\n\nquestion of whether that is a person, just as one's race and sex are irelevant to one's person.

No philosophical theory that purports that a human must tain cognitive, volitional, or affective capacities to be person has a of respectable legal precedent in its favor:\" For Blackmun, the operative contrast is between the bom and the unborn, not between the presence and the absence of some psychological capacities.

Within the bounds of our legal tradition no court could rule that an unbom child is not legally while recognizing it as a human in every sense in which a bom child is. thing being theory, requires theory living being acquire speck opinion supplies izing person living being\n\nBut; then, if he accepts that principle as relevant; how could he say that he need not answer the 'difficult question\"? And if he did not reject that principle while denying that a fetus is a person, could he implicitly say that he did not that a fetus is a human being? A key to solving both of these questions is that, following the lead of the district court,14 Blackmun the burden of on the state to establish that a fetus is person; he did not it on the individual, how deny proof put put\n\nOn the other hand, throughout his opinion Blackmun carefully distinguishes his talk about persons from his talk about life, human life, human and so On . (The sole apparent exception occurs while he is describing some ancient and medieval   discussions   that approached the question in terms of when person came into be12 Here Blackmun is clearly not endorsing this terminology.) The crucial here is that the laws relevant to this case are formulated with the term not with such terms as \"human being' Or 'human life.' Yet; again; nothing Blackmun says implies a rejection of the principle that a human is person. On the contrary, he does not rule out the argument for the personhood of the fetus based on 'the well-known facts of fetal development\" as irrelevant or a non sequitur, 18 beings, ing; point living being being\n\nRoe, to establish that fetus is not person. The onus of ultimately lies with the state because our theory of govemment is ised on the principle that govemment derives its legitimate from the consent of the governed\\_which means that  governmental acts infringing On their   rights Or frustrating their interests must be justifiable to them. Thus, the individual is not compelled to justify her exercise of her rights and capacities for action; rather, it is the state that must justify its coercive acts. In Wade the adversaries were not two (or a person and an alleged or tive person ) with competing claims of rights; the adversaries were and the State of Texas . This is so, not because the case arises from the violation of a criminal statute which pits a woman as defendant the state as prosecutor, but because the abortion statute at issue severely limits the woman's 'fundamental\" right of privacy 16 It is crucial that a governmental to the efect that a fetus is person is not an abstract intellectual   thesis; it is itself limitation of the rights of pregnant women. So the issue before the Court was not, Is the fetus, in some scientific, metaphysical or moral sense, person? Rather, it was, Can the state provide sufficient justification for limiting the rights of the pregnant woman by   categorizing fetus as when Blackmun had determined that the state failed to carry its burden, he formulated his conclusion on this whole issue by saying 'In view of all this, we do not agree that, by adopting one theory of life, Texas may override the rights of the pregnant woman at stake.' 18 proof powers persons person against ruling\n\nAs that Blackmun   countenanced no support of the suggestion made by others that the legislature Or the judiciary is empowered to define the category of to suit policy 17 No trace of dubious   theory of legal  positivism Or pragmatism is in evidence here. 18 Certainly classification by fiat is a com mon legislative and judicial activity elsewhere, but Blackmun does not treat the category of as susceptible to govemmental discretion. And rightly so, for the bestowal or denial of that status is not only awesome in its consequences but also profound in its presuppositions. A theory of govemment such as ours, predicated on the idea that government is an instrument for protecting the rights and furthering the interests of persons, cannot coherently deny that the nature of personhood and the fundamental rights inhering in it are anterior to governmental acts. To the status of person to those who rightfully possess it is howling injustice: And bestowing that status upon those public person person deny\n\n\"theory of life\" and found antiabortion   legislation   constitutional, and also that he could have denied that a fetus is a human be-(' 'in the whole sense ) and ruled against such legislation despite the substantial  precedent behind it. He might have done either, but instead at this he enters his claim that the Court need not and could not affirm OI that 'theory of life.' Texas ing point deny\n\nThe Court cannot be compelled to answer a question that it cannot answer, and here \"the judiciary is not in position to speculate as to the answer . But why not? After all, individuals, including justices as citizens, are in position to speculate, for everyone has the First Amendment freedom to speculate about this or anything: are law imposing constraints on others. For someone in that position, merely to pronounce an opinion is to impinge upon the legitimate interests of others. Here freedom of expression is limited. Indeed, even freedom of thought is restricted because court has no unexpressed opinions: the mind of a court exists only in its pronouncements. Expressing an opinion is an action, and an authority may not act when it would thereby violate the principles which legitimate its authority. private Private\n\nThus far we have explained two senses in which Blackmun need not answer on the question; the weight of precedent alone could have decided whether the unborn are persons; Second, independent of the truth of an answer to the question, inasmuch as the state had the burden of and had no other line of argument, the mere failure of the state to demonstrate the truth of its of life would imply that the unbom are not persons and that its legislation is unconstitutional.  What still needs explaining is why the Court did not need to (ie, was not compelled by logic to) that a fetus is a human while mainboth that a fetus is not person and that a human is a person To understand why the Court was under no necessity in this last and crucial respect we must move to the issue of why it could not answer the dificult question. proof theory deny being being taining\n\nBlackmun described the instant circumstances this way: Those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine, philosophy and theare unable to arrive at any consensus. He did not say-nor is it credible that he could possibly mean-that whenever question lacks a consensus of expert opinion the judiciary is not competent to make legal on the matter. Rather, he refers specifically to the extraordinary fact that, with this dificult question; presumptively expert ology finding is divided within science and philosophy and religion. By contrast, when pathologists present opposed explanations of a wound, OI trists disagree over the mental competence of an agent, theologians and philosophers have no expert opinion on the issue, no more than a chemist has much of interest to say about transubstantiation or logical atomism. Few questions arise in all three domains, and with those that do, the main disputes occur between different domains and perhaps   within one domain, but not within and between all three. Some questions of cosmology and evolution may be debated within each domain, but in that case typically the premises,  methods, and conclusions difer in kind for each domain. Yet with the question of when human life begins we find the agreeing on and appealing to much the same subsidiary data and arriving at the same wide divergence of conclusions. In fact, aside from the disagreements on the answer itself, virtually the only matter de bated within any discipline here is debated within all three and that is the question of whether this question is scientific; religious, or sophical (eg  moral OI conceptual ) And surely, when the presumed experts are in utter disarray over what kinds of expertise are even relevant to question, a judicious man might well be wary. opinion psychia philo-\n\nWhen Blackmun then proceeded \"to note briefly the wide divergence of thinking on this most sensitive and dificult question;' 26 he did not dwell on the disagreements about the character of the tion. But then he hardly needed inasmuch as he had already taken judicial notice of the troublesome character of the question with these extraordinary introductory remarks: questo,\n\nWe forthwith acknowledge OUr awareness of the sensitive and emotional nature of the abortion controversy, of the vigorous   opposing views, even among physicians, and of the and seemingly absolute convictions that the subject inspires. One's philosophy, one's experiences, one's exposure to the raw edges of human existence, one's religious training, one's attitudes lishes and seeks to observe, are all likely to infuence and to color one's thinking and conclusions about abortion.? deep\n\nThis might be dismissed as rhetorical window-dressing, inconsequenworth saying, despite keenly aware of how thoroughly unorthodox and perhaps   unique such remarks are in the context of a Supreme Court opinion. A decade later he declared: being\n\n116\n\nment on its truth value; we have, I think, reason to believe that the requisite preconditions for agreement do not exist in this case. We can say that some answers to the question are flatly wronge.g that an unfertilized egg or sperm is, by itself, a human Or that homi nization occUrS substantially after birth. But between conception and partuition there seems to be no consensus as to when human life begins, for there seems to be nothing in logic or nature that would compel agreement on the matter .84 The crucial is not that peopled do in fact disagree, but rather that we have no sound basis for supposing that disagreement here must be due to some cognitive defect. good being' point\n\nAgain, although we could conceivably come to believe that the question of when human life begins has an objectively correct answer, we can not now substantiate such beliefs. Hence, in this situation, the Court should not to answer the question; and when it denies that the unbomn are persons, it need not abandon the principle that a hutry\n\nThat Blackmun accepted the epistemological thesis is further sug; by his denying the judiciary the capacity even to 'speculate' as to the answer. Mere speculation less evidentiary backing than rendering an opinion, and, unlike the latter, it is not even category of oficial judicial action This   description of the Court's incapacity suggests more radical kind of nescience than the mere lack of information  requisite for proper  judicial determination. On the other hand, when Blackmun qualified the Court's incapacity with the clause, \"at this in the development  of man'$ knowledge;' he seems to allow the possibility that the Court's incapacity is due to some form of ignorance that could be remedied, perhaps in ten years, pertomorrow. There are, however, more plausible possibilities. Blackmun speaks here of man's knowledge;\" something much broader than embryological knowledge or even scientific knowledge, something that might encompass epistemological knowledge, knowledge, an understanding of our thinking on this question and the norms governing our thinking: The judiciary's position could conceivably be altered by, for example, a change in our conception of what constitutes a prejudicial bias regarding the question, or in our conception of what influences on OUI convictions are perversions of OUI activity. Consider the following: Ones  disposition to react to the human form with sympathetic and identificatory responses is, I assume, emotional, but do we really know whether it is prejudicial 'predilection we must be free of to be able to resolve the question? gested requires making point haps cognitive\n\n117\n\nman is a person in order to refrain from denying that a fetus is a human being being:\n\nBut if the epistemological thesis is implicit in Blackmun's opinion; then that opinion presents a decisive argument even a constitutional  amendment to nullify   the Wade not to mention congressional enactment to that  efect. The argument as presented thus far has been tailored to fit Blackmun's phrases, but the essence of the argument can readily be reformulated so as to be utterly free of any peculiarities of the judiciary. Indeed the argument is far simpler when divested of the forms internal to the judiciary to which a Court opinion must conform. First, the burden of is on the govemment It must justify its coercive acts to its coerced subjects, because government derives its legitimacy from the consent of the governed. Second, any full-scale abortion prohibition (e-g, any that prohibited abortion from conception on, except to protect the mother's health, or in cases of rape) s0 severely limits a woman's liberties and damages the interests of parents that it could be justified only if the unbomn are human (ie  in the same sense that the born are human be). Thus, a government may legitimately impose such a prohibition only if it can demonstrate that the unborn are human Third, the epistemological   thesis: that the unbomn are human is, in princible, undemonstrable; it cannot even be shown to be probable in ma tely   demand that   people respect such prohibition,  because no reason can be given as to why should respect it. against proof beings ings beings . beings they\n\nThe epistemological   thesis aside, Blackmun surely could not meant that the judiciary's inability to resolve the question was due to some incapacity that did not afect legislature. The whole thrust of his   opinion is that state legislature is not empowered to deprive a woman of her fundamental rghts by endorsing some theory of life; nothing in that opinion suggests that the impotence of a state legisla ture is due to its some power possessed by the federal legislature. A woman's rights\\_which an abortion prohibition restricts ~includetthe right interference by any level OI branch of government. have here Jacking against\n\nAgain, Blackmun's argument is more complicated, simply because a judicial must be the result of reason referring to and restrained by existing rules and concepts of the legal system. For example, Blackmun was not free to finesse the term 'person, as the simplified arguruling\n\ntoo large for me to unpack completely and do it justice. I shall briefy focus on a few salient points.\n\nFirst; the mind boggles when Blackmun tells us that the holding has multiple justifcations, one logical and one biological:. Neither the ciples of logic nor the facts of could individually yield justi fcation; only by combining the two can even an enthymatic argument be produced . Anyway, the cited premise\\_ \"the fetus then presumably has the capability of meaningful life outside the mother's womb\" \\_is not a bit of Or logic, but only bare definition. \"Viability' applied to a fetus means its capability for outside the mothers womb . Biology, in conjunction with available medical technology determines when viability occurs, not what the word means. And a definition is more a prelude to than a premise of reasoning, let alone a justiprinbiology biology living\n\nPresumably what Blackmun has in mind here harks back to that distinction between the born and the unborn. Though sometimes, as in Part VII, he seems to treat the term 'potential life'\" as though it were interchangeable with 'prenatal life' elsewhere, particularly in his conclusion, he seems pulled by the term's obviously distinct connotations A prenatal life is the life of a fetus, but the life referred to by the term 'potential life'\" is clearly that of a bomn human A fetus has an actual prenatal life but is only potentially a bom human And, I take it, Blackmun presumes that the legitimate state interest in the life of the prenatal derives wholly from its interest in the life of the postnatal. Further, it is natural (if not necessary) to construe ality as linked to capability in such a way that to be a human life at some moment is to have the capability of as a bomn human at that moment. This, 1 believe, is the reasoning behind Blackmun's viability to be the compelling It has some plausibility, but I would not wish to endorse it. If it is the rationale, then little sense can be given to Blackmun's claim that the states in terest in protecting the potentiality of human life 'grows in substantiality as the woman approaches term. That claim rings hollow in any case, inasmuch as that substance has no detectable legal effect to viability. key being: being; living potenti potential living being point. finding prior\n\nStill, [ would not that the use of viability as 'compelling' is defensible and reasonable, though I defy anyone to show it to be uniquely so. Nor would I deny the propriety of abortion to prevent the mother's death or injury to her health if the states interest in protecting matemnal health is superior to its interest in protecting potential deny point life. Of course, many will protest when Justice Douglas informs us in his concurring   opinion, which refers to the Vuitch   decision; that \"health must here be construed to 'give full sweep to the logical as well as the physical well-being' of women patients:' 41 With that construal, woman who wants late-term abortion will usually be able to find physician   willing to certify it as necessary for her health . psycho-\n\nYet the broad interpretation of matemal health as justification for an abortion is not itself so worrisome, Or would not be if it were not for two further factors. First, when the Court said, not that a state must, but that it if it chooses proscribe abortion;' and that it may do s0 only in the state's interests, not the fetus's, the Court moved from denying that the fetus is a person 'in the whole sense\" to denying it any constitutional it without any legally enforceable interests. Nothing in Blackmun's  opinion provides tionale for this or rules out the altemnative implicit in the history of abortion of recognizing the existence of legal status peculiar to the fetus . \"may, ving regulal tion, even this would be primarily of symbolic importance and not of great practical consequence, if, in Wade Or later, the Court had properly distinguished abortion\\_the termination of pregnancy\\_from the termination of the child's life. That  distinction   would seem of obvious  intrinsic  importance no matter what event the Court had picked as triggering legitimate state regulation. But when the Court fnds some inherent significance in the condition of viability, its tion seems threatened with incoherence if it then denies significance to the distinction between abortion and feticide, for there seems to be nothing significant about viability independent of its the condition in which the distinction between abortion and feticide is practical and meaningful. I do not say that the significance of viability is constituted by that distinction; but only that the former is not dent of the significance of the latter. Prochoice radicals may insist that a woman s rght to privacy extends to her on an intention to kill her unborn child, not only when unavoidable to liberate herself from as something desired in itself OI perhaps as But that surely is distinctive and highly tendentious thesis. At minimum, even if a woman has a right to decide the fate of a viable fetus, that right is not directly entailed by her right to an abortion. Nothing in Blackmun's opinion   precludes the Court from ruling that a state may-or even Yet, posi being indepenacting ting\n\n122\n\nmust\\_require that viable fetus may not be endangered, any more than is necessary to remove it from the mother without endangering the mother's physical health. With that requirement the state would have little reason to prohibit any abortion of a viable fetus; except for those abortions that are not necessary for the mother's life or health and do significantly imperil the fetal life. In my judgment, the grave moral and political reasons in this issue demand that the High Court consider the abortion controversy with utmost care.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA Human Life Statute\n\nStephen H.
