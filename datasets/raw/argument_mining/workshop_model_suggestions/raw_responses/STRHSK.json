To this aim, inspired by Comenius, he devoted his efforts or gathering knowledge by the creation of a society or office of learned men (in technical fields, philosophy, and theology), and by the establishment of a network of correspondents (the Hartlib Circle). The method of discovery underlying his program of advancement of learning was inspired by Bacon's Novum Organum and by Jacopo Aconcio's method of analysis, while the categorization and transmission of knowledge had to be based on commonplace books and artificial languages. His plan of economic improvement, to be fulfilled mainly through the amelioration of husbandry, was motivated by the Puritan Millenarianism to which he adhered.\n\n## Biography*\n\nThe life of Hartlib is documented mostly by his letters and papers, rediscovered in 1933 (Turnbull 1947; HP). He was born in Elbing around 1600 from a German royal merchant and a half-English woman, whose father  was  a  deputy  of  the  English  Company  of  trade  in  the  Baltic.  Hartlib  was educated in Brzeg (Silesia) probably until 1621, although in 1614 he matriculated at the University of Kšnigsberg (Turnbull 1920, 5). Between 1621 and 1626 he was in England, where he studied in Cambridge  under  John  Preston.  He  settled  in  London  from  1628  (Turnbull  1947,  11-15,  34; Dickson 1998, 146), likely under the suggestion of John Dury, minister in Elbing between 1625 and 1630, as part of his efforts to reconcile the Protestants (Turnbull 1920, 7-13). Moreover, he moved to  England  as  a  consequence  of  the  Hapsburg  and  Catholic  conquest  of  the  region  of  Elbing (Trevor-Roper  1967,  231-234).  In  England  Hartlib  pursued  a  program  of  reform  of  learning  by establishing a school in Chichester, although unsuccessfully (Hartlib  1630).  Moreover,  he developed a program of reform of all knowledge, having been acquainted with Comenius's Janua linguarum (1631)  and  with  the  draft  of  the Pansophia ,  which  he  published  in  1637  and  1639 (Webster 1970a, 22-25; Č apkov‡ 1994, 80-85). This program was the outcome of a movement of reform  set  by  Ramus,  Keckermann  and  Alsted  (Hotson  1994  and  2011)  and  served  both  for  the advancement of learning and for religious peace (Clucas 1991; Houston 2014, 124-131). To these aims, Hartlib first envisaged the creation of a ÒSocietas Reformatorum et CorrespondencyÓ (1634) (Dickson  1998,  148-158),  and  then  (together  with  Dury)  of  an  ÒOffice  of  Public  Address  in Spiritual and Temporal mattersÓ, i.e. an institute intended to the gathering of information and to the accomplishment  of  Bacon's  and  ComeniusÕs  scientific  and  educational  programs  (Hartlib  1647, 1648; Slack 2015, 102-116). Moreover, he devoted some short treatises to the attempts of unifying the Protestants (Hartlib 1641, 1643), and to recollections of othersÕs essays, mainly in husbandry. In developing his project of gathering knowledge, Hartlib the ÒintelligencerÓ came to form a Circle, primarily constituted by himself, Dury and Comenius (Trevor-Roper 1967, 219-271), and involving several  experts  with  whom  Hartlib  corresponded  in  around  4,718  letters  (EMLO).  The  Hartlib Circle  included  Robert  Boyle,  Gabriel  Plattes  (author  of  the  Utopian  dialogue Macaria ,  1641), William Petty, John Milton, Theodore Haak and Henry Oldenburg. Members of the Circle formed in 1646-1647 the 'Invisible CollegeÕ that would later inspire the birth of the Royal Society, although Hartlib did not establish or set the program of both (Turnbull 1953; Webster 1974 and 1975, 58). For his writing and projects he spent all his provisions and obtained from the Government of the Commonwealth a pension in 1647. Still, he died in needy conditions in 1662 (Turnbull 1920, 48-51, 62).\n\n## Innovative aspects and influences\n\nHartlibÕs program of reform consisted of 1) the gathering of information and observations, and 2) their categorization in a unique body of knowledge ( pansophia )  (Clucas 1991, 35). This program relied  on  the  methodology  expounded  in  Bacon's Novum  Organum ,  which  Hartlib  opposes  the 'systematic' approach of Cartesian and Scholastic philosophy (Yeo 2010, 188-194), and on Jacopo Aconcio's method, consisting of the analysis of notions and facts as the main source of knowledge in  science  and  religion  (Clucas  1994,  58-62).  Moreover,  Hartlib's  program  required  a  method  of teaching,  learning  and  transmitting  knowledge:  accordingly,  he  appropriated  the  method  of epitomization of John Harrison (Clucas 1994, 64-68; Yeo 2007 and 2010), and recommended the use  of  summaries  and  commonplace  as  the  most  viable  means  in  learning  and  disseminating knowledge. This method, which in Hartlib's plans had to be taught to children in order to enhance their  memory,  would  inspire  William  Petty's  pedagogy  (Petty  1647;  Yeo  2007,  11-17  and  2010, 190-191).  Moreover,  Hartlib  promoted  the  use  of  artificial  languages,  and  availed  the  system  of abbreviations of George Dalgarno (Slaughter 1982, 104-116, 120-122; Strasser 1994; Lewis 2005). Hartlib's  program  was  aimed  to  practice:  first  and  foremost,  to  husbandry,  as  testified  to  by  his collections of technical essays (Hartlib 1651a, b, 1653a, b, 1655a, 1659) and by Plattes's Macaria (Webster 1972), expounding advices for the economic improvement of England. Moreover, Hartlib supported the reform of teaching by the creation of new academies centred on technical disciplines, such as those one can found in John Milton's On Education (Raylor 1993 and 2010). Husbandry was central to Hartlib's interests as it allowed to put in practice his Baconian method, moreover, it was  a  means  for  the  understanding  of  nature,  as  husbandry  was  based  on  the  knowledge  of alchemical  elements  (Matei  2012  and  2013;  Houston  2014,  129-132).  Also,  it  served  to  the transformation  of  the  world  that  was  a  main  ideal  of  Puritanism,  to  which  Hartlib  adhered  (Jue 2006,  67-68).  In  his  views,  the  amelioration  of  the  world  would  lead  to  the  fulfilment  of  the providential  plan  of  God  and  to  the  beginning  of  the  Millennium  (Hartlib  1651c;  Webster  1979; Mulsow  2001;  Jue  2006,  77-84;  Matei  2011;  Houston  2014,  125-126).  Hartlib  even  sponsored colonial projects as part of his project, such as those of the Huguenots Hugh L'Amy and Peter Le Pruvost (Irving 2008, 47-68; Leng 2009).\n\nCross-References (if there are any; please include a list of other entries in this encyclopedia that may be of further interest to your readers.)\n\nBacon, Francis Baconianism\n\nHaak, Theodore\n\nMilton, John - Renaissance Philosophy\n\nEducation - Renaissance Philosophy\n\nAlsted, Johann Heinrich\n\nComenius, J.
