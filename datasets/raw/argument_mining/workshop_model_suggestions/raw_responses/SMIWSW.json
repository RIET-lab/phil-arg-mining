    "user_content": "## WHAT SHOULD WE DO WITH OUR BRAIN? A REVIEW ESSAY\n\nI.\n\nCatherine Malabou's book can be contextualized in terms of the two broad questions that are indicated in her title.\n\n1. First, it would not be inaccurate to suggest that What Should We Do With Our  Brains? is  a  book  that,  at  its  heart,  is  concerned  with  the  philosophical problem of freedom .  As the title indicates, it approaches this question through a reflection  on  contemporary  science,  and  more  specifically,  on  contemporary neuroscience.\n\nIn  this  regard,  Malabou's  project  bears  a  certain  resemblance  to  Kant's critical  project  (although  Kant's  name  does  not  appear  in  the  book).  Kant's philosophy, famously, was grounded  in a reflection on a Galilean and Newtonian universe that had become mathematized and deterministic. Within this universe, Kant's three critiques asked three questions: What can we know? What must we do? And what can we hope for? The second question -What must we do? -animated Kant's analyses, in the second critique, The Critique of Practical Reason , of the problematic status of freedom in a deterministic world.\n\nIn a sense, Malabou's short bookit is only 82 pages in translation -takes up the baton handed to her by Kant, and once again asks the question, 'What Should We Do?'  But the conditions of this question have changed since Kant's time.  It  is  no  longer  a  question  of  locating  freedom  within  a  deterministic universe.  Quite  the  contrary,  we  live  in  a  world  that  seems  to  have  been reinjected,  as  it  were,  with  certain  degrees  of  freedom:  physics  has  become nondeterministic; genetics emphases the role of chance in biological mutations; capitalism, for all its repressive recodings, is also, in Deleuze's parlance, a vast enterprise of  decoding  (in  neoliberal  language,  it  is  the  'freedom  to  choose'); and neuroscience itself emphases the fundamental 'plasticity' or freedom of the synaptic  connectivity  of  the  brain.  Put  schematically,  one  might  say  that  the question  of  freedom  has  been  inverted  since  Kant.  The  question  is  no  longer, How can we consider ourselves to be free in a deterministic world?, but rather: Why  are  we not free in a world  in which  science itself seems  to see indeterminacy, stochastic  processes,  chance,  and  randomness  at the  most  basic levels  of  physical,  chemical,  biological,  and  neurological  events?  As  Malabou\n\nputs  it,  echoing  Rousseau's  famous  phrase,  Why  is  it,  'given  that  the  brain  is plastic [and] free,' that 'we are still always and everywhere 'in chains'' (11).\n\n2.  Second,  this  general  problem  raises  the  more  specific  question:  Why then  did  Malabou  choose  to  link  her  analysis  of  freedom  to  the  status  of contemporary  neuroscience?  The  title  of  Malabou's  book  is  not  simply  Kant's 'What should we do?' but rather: 'What should we do with our brains ?' Why does  Malabou  link  the  question  of  freedom  with  the  structure  of  the  brain? Malabou  doesn't  make  this  explicit,  but  one  can  think  of  three  interrelated reasons. First, in Foucauldian terms, the relations between power and knowledge are more evident in the so-called human sciences (linguistics, political economy, psychiatry, and so on) than in the socalled 'hard sciences' such a s physics and chemistry. Insofar as  it  takes  'human  beings'  as  its  object,  neuroscience  can  be said  to  be  a  human  science.  Yet  at  the  same  time,  secondly,  neuroscience  also aspires (and indeed often claims) to be a hard science: it deals with the biological organism;  the  chemical  communication  that  takes  place  within  the  brain;  its structure  in  physics.  But  thirdly,  neuroscience  is  also  a  'science  of  the  mind,' insofar as it claims to tell us something about the nature of human thought and behavior,  the  structure  of  thinking  itself,  which  is  seen  to  be  grounded  in  the neuronal and synaptic structure of the brain. (As an example of the latter, Pascal Boyer's book, Explaining Religion ,  attempts  to  interpret  religious  phenomena  as corresponding to the innate structures of the brain, in a somewhat Chomskyian manner).\n\nNeuroscience, in short, seems to have a somewhat unique position: it is a human science, but one that claims to be grounded in the hard sciences, and for that reason, it claims to give us a scientific explanation of something that seems to elude science, or of which science itself is an exemplification, namely, human thought and behavior. This is no doubt why  evolutionary psychology, anthropology,  psychiatry,  psychology,  and  so  on,  are  increasingly  based  on results in neuroscience, and frequently appeal to it in their analyses -precisely because  neuroscience  forms  the  current  scientific  conception  of  what  Noam Chomsky  might  call,  simply,  'human  nature.'    In  this  sense,  another  form  of Malabou's title question might therefore be: How should we use neuroscience? How should we make use of this  new  science  that  seems  to  be  becoming  the ground of all the other human sciences?\n\nII.\n\nMalabou's reflections on freedom and neuroscience are organized around the fundamental concept of plasticity .  'Plasticity in the nervous system,' we are told, 'means an alteration in structure or function brought about by development, experience, or injury' (5). In her first chapter, entitled 'Plasticity's Field's of Action,' Malabou analyzes three 'fields of action' in the brain where plasticity plays a fundamental role.\n\nFirst,  there  is developmental plasticity.  During  the  first  six  months  of  life, the brain becomes 'progressively sculpted, stabilized, and divided into different regions' and 'to the extent that the volume of connections grows, the identity of an individual begins to outline itself' (20). Nonetheless, even though 'all human brains resemble each other' (18), there is nonetheless 'a certain plasticity in the execution of th e genetic program' (20): the 'topographic network' of the infant brain is established through the death of certain neuronal cells and the elimination of useless connections (20).\n\nSecond,  there  is modulational plasticity.  Here,  epigenetic  sculpting  gives way to 'the modulation of synaptic efficiency' in relation to the brain's external environment  (21).  Here  Malabou  discusses  the  important  notions  of  synaptic potentiation  and  depression.  In  modulational  plasticity,  'the  efficacy  of  the synapse  (its  capacity  to  transmit  signals  from  neuron  to  neuron)  either  rises, which is called 'long term potentiation' (LTP) or diminishes, which is 'long term depression'' (22). In other words, 'synapses can see their efficacy reinforced or weakened as a function of experience' (24). While learning to play the piano, for instance, 'the mechanism for depressing entry signals corresponding to incorrect movem ents ('mistakes') makes possible the acquisition of the correct movements' through potentiation (23). Put simply, modulational plasticity is the formation  of  new  neuronal  connections  in  a  brain,  in  relation  to  its  external environment.\n\nThird,  there  is reparative plasticity,  which  includes  not  only  'the  brain's capacity  to  compensate  for  losses  caused  by  lesions'  (25),  but  what  is  called 'neuronal renewal' or secondary neurogenesis' (25), which means that 'certain neurons in regions important to the learning process renew themselves continually' (25), such that it 'constitutes an additional mechanism of individuation' (27).\n\nMalabou analyzes these three modes to show how plasticity operates at every  level  of  the  brain,  not  only  in  the  development  of  new  neuronal connections  in  the  brain,  and  their  constant  repair,  but  also  at  the  level  of  the execution  of  the  genetic  program  itself.  It  is  a  very  enlightening  analysis, especially for someone, like myself, who is an amateur in neuroscience.\n\nAlongside this analysis of the role of plasticity in neuroscience, however, Malabou provides a slightly different conceptual analysis of the notion plastique , which anticipates her somewhat Hegelian conclusion. On the one hand, the term plasticity -from the Greek plassein ,  to mold -has two basic senses: ' it means at once the capacity to receive form (clay  is  called 'plastic' and the capacity to give form (as  in  the  plastic  arts  or  in  plastic  surgery)'  (5).  On  the  other  hand, the French term plastique is  'an explosive substance m ade up of nitroglycerine and nitrocellulose,  capable  of  causing  violent  explosions'  (5).  Thus,  the  analysis  of the  term plasticity itself  reveals  that,  in  Hegelian  fashion,  the  concept  contains within itself two somewhat contradictory extremes: 'on the one side, the sensible\n\nimage of taking form (sculpture or plastic objects), and on the other side, that of the annihilation of all form (explosion)' (5).\n\nThese two types of analyses run side by side throughout Malabou's book: an  analysis  of  way  in  which  plasticity  is  used  in  neuroscience,  and  then  a conceptual  or  etymological  analysis  of  the  term  along  Hegelian  (or  even Derridian)  lines.  In  my  mind,  it's  not  always  clear  how  these  two  types  of analyses link up, or indeed if they link up, although Malabou makes the attempt. At the end of the book, for instance, Malabou suggests a Hegelian solution to the problem of the relation between the neuronal and the mental (the neuroscientific variant  of  the  body/mind  problem,  that  is,  How  can  neuronal  connections produce thought?), but it is not clear to me how the conceptual analysis solves the neuroscientific problem. I'll return to this in a moment.\n\nThe first chapter -with its analysis of plasticity -concludes by posing the crucial question for Malabou: Is brain plasticity a model of freedom ,  that  is,  the ability  to  form  new  neuronal  connections,  and  ultimately  to  bring  about 'transformative effects' on others (31)? Or is it, rather, a biological justification of the manner in which the brain is necessarily molded by the economic, political, and  social  organization  with  which  it  interacts?  In  effect,  Malabou  is  going  to argue that the potential for both is inherent the notion of brain plasticity.\n\nThis  question  leads  into  the  second  chapter,  which  is  entitled  'Central Powe r  in  Crisis.'  The  term  'central  power'  refers  to  the  way  in  which  old models  of  the  brain  tended  to  be  modeled  on  technologies  of  command  and control, that is, models that derive their images from the State. Such models of what Malabou calls the 'machine brain' can be as diverse as Bergson's image of the  brain  as  a  'central  telephone  exchange'  (33),  or  more  recent  images  of  the brain as kind of computer: the brain is the hardware, and thought is its software. In  all  these  models,  the  brain  was  understood  to  be  something  like  a  central power  in  the  body,  issuing  'governing  and  command  functions'  (32)  from above.  The  brain  was  seen  as  'a  machine  that  works  from  the  top  down,  that orders movement, controls behavior,' and so forth (xi). 'In an earlier day,' Marc Jeannerod  writes  in  his  foreword ,  'this  centralizing  and  unifying  vision  truly represented an ideal of governance: one sole leader, one sole head commanding and organizing everything' (xi).\n\nNow the  concept  of  brain  plasticity -with  its  related  notions  of  neural networks and connectionism -has completely shattered this image of the brain as  a  central  power,  and  no  doubt  that  has  been  a  great  step  forward  in  our understanding of the  brain.  But  the  strength  of  Malabou's  analysis  is  to  show how this shift in our understanding of the brain was not simply a development that  took  place  in  neuroscience.  More  importantly,  it  has  co-occurred  with  a radical  modification  of  our  economic  and  social  environment,  that  is,  it  has paralleled a similar shift in the management structure of corporations, and the organization of the capitalist system in general. What Malabou proposes in this chapter, then, is an analysis of 'a similarity of functioning betweenâ€¦economic\n\norganization  and  neuronal  organization'  (41),  and  it  is  one  of the  richest  and most original aspects of the book. It charts the move away from what one might call  a  'soviet'  (xiii)  vision  of  the  braina  topdown image of the  brain  as  'a rigid,  predetermined,  directing  organ '( xiii) -toward a more 'liberal' or  even 'democratic' vision of the brain as 'a supple, adaptable, plastic organ' (xiii).\n\nMala bou's main point of reference here is the 1999 book by Luc Boltanski and Eve Chiapello called The New Spirit of Capitalism , which stressed the growing role  of 'flexible  networks' in  the  management  structure  of  corporations.  The central  command  of  the  C.E.O  has  become  increasingly  replaced  by  what Malabou  likes  to  call  'the  neuronal  manager'  (43),  that  is,  the  bureaucrat  or executive who 'transmits, distributes, and modifies connections by potentiating or  depressing  them  according  to  circumstances  and  needs,  without  being identifiable with or assigned to a fixed post' (44).  According to Boltakski and Chiapello, capitalism refers to neuronal functioning both implicitly and explicitly: implicitly, because capitalism, as they say, in a somewhat Deleuzian vein, claims 'to replace essentialist ontologies with open spaces without borders, centers or fixed points, where entities are constituted by the relations they enter into and alter in line with the flows, transfers, exchanges, permutations, and displacements that are the relevant events in this space' (45). But the appeal to neuronal  models  is  also  explicit,  insofar  as  'today's  management  literature preaches work in 'flexible, neural' teams, and can claim that the manager 'is not [or  is  no  longer]  a  (hierarchical)  boss,  but  an  integrator,  a  facilitator,  an inspiration , a unifier of energies, an enhancer of life , meaning, and autonomy '' (43).\n\nSimilarly,  at  the  level  of  workers  (rather  than  management),  Malabou points  out  that employment has  now  become  synonymous  with  being adaptable and flexible .  'Anyone  who  is  not  flexible,'  she  writes,  'deserves  to  disappear' (46).  There is thus an almost measurable link between social suffering (such as unemployment) and psychical suffering (or depression) -in effect, unemployed people suffer from 'illnesses of flexibility' (47). They have become unemployed because they were not flexible enough: when they lose their job, they are not able to  quickly  adapt  and  modify  themselves;  they  lack  the  flexibility  to  retrain themselves for a new job. As a result, the unemployed often become depressed and  apathetic -an apathy  that  is  characterized  in  the  literature  by  'a  holding back, stiffening, braking, and suspension of activity ' (48). In other words, lack of social  flexibility  literally  becomes  paralleled  by  a  lack  of  neuronal  flexibility  in the brain -and the relation between the two is not simply one of analogy. In this sense, the workplace can be said to have become 'the antechamber of nervous depression' (49).\n\nEven  more  to  the  point,  perhaps,  Malabou  suggests  that  it  is the Alzheimer's  patient  who,  more  than  any  other,  represents  'the  nemesis  of connectionist society, the counter model of flexibilityâ€¦.: errant, without memory,  asocial,  without  recourse'  (52).  Malabou  is  here  drawing  a  parallel between  illnesses of social disconnection, such as the depression of the\n\nunemployed, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Both involve disconnection from the rest of the network: in the case of the unemployed, reconnection is possible; in the case of the Alzheimer's patient, it is not. 'This is how dementia appears as the counter-model of plasticity: the irreparable loss of connections at the core of the cerebral network entails a definitive disconnection from the social network' (xiii). As Malabou asks, 'Is the difference really all that great between the picture we have an unemployed person about to be kicked off the dole and the picture we ha ve of someone suffering from Alzheimer's?' (10).\n\nConversely, to be 'healed' from this social depression essentially means 'to  reintegrate,  to  restore  flexibility'  (51).  Malabou  suggests  that  this  is  one reason why Prozac became such a popular drug: it allowed one to obtain, at a low  cost,  the  type  of self  or  individuality  that  today's  'high -tech  capitalism' endorses as its condition of possibility -a form of capitalism in which 'confidence, flexibility, quickness, and energyâ€¦are at a premium' (51).  Whence the complex role of the psychopharmaceutical industry, whose genuine importance Malabou insists upon, but which also tends to operate in the service of  the  flexibility  demanded  by  the  capitalist  organization  of  our  society -to  a certain  degree,  this  is  what  guides  their  research  and  development  programs. 'Anti -depressants,'  she  writes,  'in  their  great  diversity,  all  seek  to  stimulate neurochemical transmission, with the avowed goal of 'restoring and protecting the plastic capacities of the brain'' (48). 'To survive today means to be connected ' (10).\n\nNow in drawing this  parallel  between  the  neuronal  and  the  social,  one might be tempted to pose epistemological questions to Malabou concerning the exact relationship between the two (questions concerning 'social constructionism' and so forth). Is she saying that the shift in our global capitalist economy generated a conceptual shift  that  has  altered,  as  if  by  contagion,  our view of the way the brain functions? Or is she saying that it is this new 'neo -liberal' connectionist  brain  that  has  imposed  its  model  on  our  socioeconomic system? Malabou does not really attempt to answer these questions, apart from saying  that  'neuronal  functioning  and  social  functioning interdetermine each other and mutually give each other form' (9). (One might like to know how she thinks this 'mutual interdetermination' works.)\n\nBut if Malabou does not answer these questions, it is because what she is doing -in this undeniably brilliant chapter -is not epistemology or the philosophy of science, but rather a critique of ideology, and more specifically, a critique  of  'neuronal  ideology'  (11),  that  is,  'an  ideological  critique  of  the fundamental  concepts  of  the  neurosciences'  (82).  What  does  this  mean?  'Any vision of the brain,' Malabou explains, 'is necessarily political' (52). What this implies  is  that  neuroscience  has  what  might  be  called  a  'naturalization  effect' (9).  'We  live  in  a  'connectionist  world''-with  its  'part -time  jobs,  temporary contracts,  the  demand  for  absolute  mobility  and  adaptability,  the  demand  for creativity'  (10)but  what  neuroscience  does,  wittingly  or  unwittingly,  is  to\n\nbestow  on  our  connectionist  economy  'the  coherence  and  immediacy  of something natural ' (9).  This  is  the  form  of  all  effective  social  legitimation:  our soc ial order is legitimate because it is 'only natural.'\n\nThis,  then,  is  the  problem  that  lies  at  the  heart  of  Malabou's  book.  The brain, she says, provocatively, is 'the essential thing, the biological, sensible, and critical locus of our time, through which pass, one way or another, the political evolutions and revolutions that began in the eighties and opened the twenty-first century'  (53).  And  yet,  she  writes,  'at  bottom,  neuronal  man'that  is,  we ourselves -'has  not  known  how  to  speak  of  himself'  (53)  or  to  produce  'a consciousness  of  the  brain'  (54).  The  reason:  'neuroscientific  discourse'  has 'unwittingly  produced  criteria,  models,  and  categories  for  regulating  social functioning and increasing daily the legitimation of the demand for flexibility as a  gl obal  norm'  (53).  In  other  words,  wittingly  or  unwittingly,  'the  scientific description  of  brain  plasticity  producesâ€¦an  extremely  normalizing  vision  of democracy, in that it accords an overly central role to the absence of center, a too rigid prominence to flexibility; that is to say, to docility and obedience' (53).\n\nThus, the political question posed by the many advances in neuroscience is  this:  Can  the plasticity of  the  brain  resist  the flexibility demanded  of  it  by capitalism?  Can  brain  plasticity  avoid  simply  reproducing  the  flexibility  of  it required by capitalism? As Malabou says, 'our brain isâ€¦essentially what we do with it '  (30),  yet  this  plasticity  of  the  brain  can  move  in  one  of  two  directions: either 'brain  plasticity  [can]  constitute  the  biologi cal  justification  of  a  type  of economic, political, and social organization in which all that matters is the result of  action  as  such:  efficacy,  adaptability -unfailing  flexibility'  (31). Or 'brain plasticity, taken as a model, [can] allow us to think a multiplicity of interactions in which the participants exercise transformative effects on one another through the demands of recognition, of nondomination, and of liberty' (31).\n\nThis, then, is the substance of Malabou's critique 'neuronal ideology' (11). Her claim is not that neuroscience, as a form of knowledge, is simply a reflection of its social conditions. Her thesis is much stronger: the discovery of the plasticity of  the  brain both reflects  the  structure  of  capitalism and points  the  way  for  a conception of the production of the new . In Deleuze's parlance, neuroscience is a vast enterprise of recoding and decoding.\n\n## III.\n\nThis brings us to Malabou's third and final chapter, which is entitled 'You are Your  Synapses.'  The  problem  she  now  needs  to  addres s  is:  if  we are our synapses, how do we prevent the plasticity of the brain from falling back on the mere flexibility demanded of it by capitalism?\n\nMalabou begins to formulate a response to this problem by tackling the traditional brain/mind problem, and by putting into question 'the certainty that there exists a perfect continuity between the neuronal and the mental,' that is,\n\nbetween  the  biological  structure  of  the  brain  and  what  one  might  call  the noological  structure  of  thought.  One  can  see  why:  Where,  in  this  relation between the brain and the mind, between the neuronal and mental, is there space for what one might callâ€¦ freedom ?\n\nThe presumption that there is a continuity between the neuronal and the mental, as Malabou perceptively notes, 'is at once t he strongest and the weakest point  of  neuroscientific  discourse  in  general'  (56):  strongest,  because  it  has indeed  allowed  us  to  approach  phenomena  such  as  memory,  perception, learning, and even psychical and behavioral problems, more and more precisely an d objectively. But it is also the weakest point, she says, because 'the certainty of the continuity between the neuronal and the mental can obviously never be a strictly scientific postulate. It necessarily constitutes a philosophical or epistemological po sitionâ€¦[that is] not always clearly articulated' (56).\n\nSo Malabou's strategy is to interrogate the transition from the neuronal to the mental, and to challenge the idea that there is a continuity from the biological to the cultural, from the natural base of the mind to its historical, political, and social dimension. She wants 'to unsettle the very concept of continuity, and in so doing to perturb flexibility' (56). 'If we do not think through this transformation [from the neuronal to the mental], or this plasticity,' Malabou writes, 'we dodge the most important question, which is -precisely -'that of freedom ' (69).\n\nNow in undertaking this challenge, Malabou turns to the work of the wellknown neuroscientist, Antonio Damasio, the author of Descartes' Error and The Feeling of What Happens . In his own attempt to see how we get from the neuronal to the mental, Damasio was led to posit what he calls a ' protoself' (57). What Damasio  means  by  this  term  is  that 'the  essence  of  who  you  are  is  stored  as synaptic int eractions in and between the various subsystems of your brain' (58, quoting LeDoux), that is, the self, at its most basic level, is simply 'a syntheses of all the plastic processes at work in the brain' (58). Second question: 'Why don't the systems  learn  different things  and  pull  our  thoughts,  emotions,  and motivations in different directions? What makes them work together, rather than as  an  unruly  mob?' (58).  Answer: because the proto -self  indicates  the  way  the brain represents the organism to  itself -'the state of the internal milieu, viscera, vestibular system, and musculoskeletal frame' (59). Third question: Where does my core consciousnessness come from, and even my autobiographical consciousness?  Damasio  claims  that  they  emerge  from  this  proto-self  in  a progressive  manner,  without  rupture,  through  a modification of  the  proto-self (59). Consciousness is, in effect, an extensive 're -representation of the nonconsicous protoself in the process of being modified' (61). It is precisely this process -the movement from the proto-self to the conscious self -that corresponds to the translation of neuronal patterns into mental patterns (61), and this  re-representation  of  the  proto-self  takes  place  in  what  Damasio  calls 'images'  or  'signs':  'visual  images,  auditory  im ages,  tactile  images,  and  so forth'  (61).  Taken  together,  these  images  constitute  'the  elementary  life  of  the\n\nthree domains of cognition, emotion, and motivation' (61). Such, in essence, is Damasio's thesis on how we get from the neuronal to the mental.\n\nYet, as Malabou points out, 'no one today is in a position to prove that all cognitive, emotional, or practical activities are the reformulated and resystematized equivalents of neuronal configurations' (62). Why? Because not all of  the  neuronal  patterns  become  images  or  signs,  not  all  dispositions  become schemas  (64).  'If  we  are  from  the  start  a  non -conscious  protoself  always  'in process of being modified,' how is this modification effected?' (65). It is precisely at this point, in the transition from the neuronal to the mental, that the political, economic,  and  social  questions  reappear.  For  example,  one  answer  to  this problem is the theory that has come to be known as 'mental Darwinism,' which states  that  'only  those  neuron  configurations  capable  of  sur vival,  thus,  those capable  of  being  the  'best,'  the  highest  'performing,'  would  be  converted  into images.  Only  the  most  'useful'  synaptic  connections  would  be  modulated  or reinforced' (65). What this would mean is that the transition from the neuronal to  the  mental  would  proceed  solely  by  natural  selection  (or  cultural  selection, which amounts to the same thing)' (65). One can easily see how such a 'natural selection' of neurons would easily lead back to the capitalist ideal of flexibility: 'there  would  see m  to  be  at  the  heart  of  the  [proto-]  self  a  selection  oriented toward efficacy' (65).\n\nBut  might  there  not  be  another  answer  to  this  question  (concerning  the transition  from  the  neuronal  to  the  mental)?  One  that  would  not  have  brain plasticity  simply  repr oduced in capitalist  flexibility?  If  'personality  is  [indeed] reformable'  (68),  then  Malabou's  suggestions  is  that  it  might  be  possible  to envision a fourth type of plasticity -in addition to the developmental, modulational,  and  reparative  plasticities  analyzed  in  the  first  chapter -an intermediate plasticity situated between the proto-self and the conscious self.\n\nWhat would this 'intermediate plasticity' be? Here, Malabou performs a movement similar to Freud's later turn toward a meta -psychology in Beyond the Pleasure Principle . This is the text where Freud, having posited the pleasure as the guiding  principle  of  our  psychic  life,  notes  that  there  are  in  fact  numerous exceptions  to  this  principle -such  as  soldiers  who  constantly  repeat  painful wartime  traumas  in  their  mind  (repetition  compulsion).  To  deal  with  this problem, Freud had to turn to philosophical speculation: he posited the 'meta -psychological' existence of an unseen  death instinct in the unconscious, operating alongside the erotic drives toward pleasure.\n\nFor her part, Malabou, in her own speculative turn, instead of speaking of a meta-psychology, instead proposes a kind of 'meta -neurobiology' (70) that in the end, for her, is fundamentally -and perhaps not surprisingly -Hegelian and dialectical  in  nature. (Malbou's  earlier  book  was  entitled The  Future  of  Hegel: Plasticity, Temporality and Dialectic , which was transited into English by Lisabeth During). To be sure, Hegel did not express himself in the idiom of the neuronal and the mental, but he was nonetheless preoccupied with the transformation of\n\nthe mind's natural existence (the brain, which he calls the ' natural sou l' ) into its historical and speculative being. 'But this transformation,' as Malabou notes, 'is the  dialectic  itself.  If  there  can  be  a  transition  from  nature  to  thought,  this  is because  the  nature  of  thought  contradicts  itself.  Thus  the  translation  from  a purely biological entity into a mental entity takes place in the struggle of the one against  the  other,  producing  the  truth  of  their  relation.  Thought  is  therefore nothing  but  nature,  but  a  negated  nature,  marked  by  its  own  difference  from itself'  (81).  In  this  way,  Malabou  thinks  she  can  avoid  the  alternative  between reductionism (the possibility of an absolute naturalization of thought processes) and anti-reductionism (an assertion of the transcendental character of thought, irreducible to biological determinations). These are the two options represented, respectively,  by  Changeux  and  Ricoeur  in  their  well-known  and  fascinating book, What  Makes  Us  Think? 'A  reasonable  materialism,' Malabou  writes, 'would posit that the natural contradicts itself and that thought is the fruit of this contradiction' (82).\n\nBut it is not clear to me that this 'Hegelian reading of the neurosciences' (as Å½iÅ¾ek  gleefully  dubs  it  in  his  blurb  for  the  book)  is  actually  Malabou's ultimate  position,  which  seems  closer  to  Foucault  and  Deleuze,  both  of  whom make  appearances  in  the  book,  and  in  fact  seem  more  suited  to  Malabou's purposes.\n\nWith regard to Foucault: Malabou herself writes that 'the transition form the neuronal to the mental presupposes negation [Hegel] and resistance [Foucault]'  (72).  Foucault,  of  course,  talked  about  the  difference  between subjection ,  which  is  our  subjugation  to  forms  of  knowledge  and  power,  and subjectivation , which  is  self-affectivity,  auto-constitution,  and  self-fashioning (71) -something which Damasio, in his own language, calls the 'transition from 'homeostasis'  to  'self -generation.'' Malabou  herself  describes  auto-affection, usin g Bergsonian language, as a kind of 'ontological explosion' (72), that is, a series of 'creative bursts that progressively transform nature into freedom' (74). So there seems to Foucauldian tone to Malabou's characterization of the neuronal self  as  'struct ured  by  a  dialectical  play  of  the  emergence  and  annihilation  of form' (72). Indeed, Malabou concludes her book by answering the title question in  a  Foucauldian  vein:  ' Creating  resistance  to  neuronal  ideology  is  what  our  brain wants, and what we want for it ' (77).\n\nWith regard to Deleuze: Malabou herself notes that Deleuze was 'one of the  rare  philosophers  to  have  taken  an  interest  in  neuro-scientific  research  as early as the 1980s' (36), and indeed his entire work on the cinema was grounded in neuroscience. Bergson held the interesting position that the brain was simply an interval  or  gap  opened  up  between  stimulus  and  response,  between perception  and  action.  In  an  amoeba,  a  stimulus  produces  an  immediate response; but in more mobile animals with nervous systems, the brain introduces a  gap  between the two,  which allows reflection and memory to  intervene  in  the response.  Each  element  produces  in  image  in  the  brain,  in  almost  exactly\n\nDamasio's sense: images of my perception, images of possible responses, images of my being affected, which in turn opens up temporal images of recollection and memory.  And  indeed,  these  are  the  fundamental  categories  one  finds  in Deleuze's cinema books: perception-images, action-images, affect-images, timeimages, recollection-images, and so on. In other words, as Malabou herself notes, 'the plasticity of the brain'with its various images -'is the real image of the world'  (39).  For  Deleuze,  the  circuits  and  connections  in  the  brainor  rather their  cuts  and  interstices -are never given in advance, but must themselves be traced out in it; and they constitute the condition for the production of the new, the genesis of the heterogeneous, and the creation of differences that resist the very  flexibility  demanded  of  us  by  the  capitalist  organization.  After  reading Malabou,  it  is  clear  that  it  is  now  time  to  reread Deleuze's  cinema  books,  not from the viewpoint of film studies or Bergson studies, but from the neurological problem that Malabou has so brilliantly highlighted in this book.\n\nIV.\n\nSo this, then, is  Malabou's answer to the question, 'What should we do with  our  brain?':  we  should  not  allow  the  plasticity  of  our  brains  to  simply replicate  the  current  economic  demand  for  flexibility -which is  what  she  calls 'neuronal ideology' ('a capac ity to self-modify at the whom of fluxes, transfers, and exchanges' [78])but rather should understand plasticity as the production of  the  new.  It  is  in  this  spirit  that  Malabou  concludes  by  admonishing  her readers,  in  a  Derridaean  vein,  to 'constructâ€¦a re lation  with  their  brain  as  the image of a world to come ' (82).\n\nMalabou's  problem  with  the  neurological revolution is that it has revolutionized nothing for  us ' (68). 'The only real view of progress opened by the  neurosciences,' she suggests, 'is that of  an improvement in the 'quality of life' though a better treatment of illness' (68), or an adaptation of the brain to the flexibility  demanded  of  it  by  our  capitalist  social  formation.  As  yet,  'the fascinating discoveries of the neurosciencesâ€¦are [as yet] i ncapable of unleashing possibilities, of unleashing new ways of living' (67). And this is what Malabou is calling for in this book, an 'awakening of a consciousness of the brain,' that is, an awakening of a comprehension that 'the brain is our work and we do no know it '  (66).  And  this  work  done on the  brain by the  brain,  the  production  and constitution of the new, is nothing other than the movement of the problem that seems to animate this entire book -namely, the problem of freedom .\n\nA review essay  of  Catherine  Malabou ,  What  Should  We  Do  With  Our  Brain? ,  trans.
