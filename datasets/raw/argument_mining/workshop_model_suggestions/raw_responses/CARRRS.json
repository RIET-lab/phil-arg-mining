    "user_content": "Abstract\n\nThis paper explores Reiner Schürmann’s account of perigrinal ontology from the perspective of Meister Eckhart. What is so extraordinary about his work is its retrieval of nuances in Plato’s philosophy of mind. Professor Schürmann’s approach to Philosophy focused on a philosopher’s philosophy of mind. For example, his course titles, such as Augustine’s Philosophy, were listed and taught in *Augustine’s Philosophy of Mind* . The advantage of his approach can best be seen in his study of the Medieval Philosopher Meister Eckhart. In this work, Professor Schürmann totalizes the relationship between the will and the intellect and unites the different categories of Platonic philosophy under the concept of perigrinal ontology. Instead of treating epistemology or aesthetics in isolation, they are examined as they relate to ontology. In Plato’s epistemology, the highest form of knowing is different; at its highest point, knowledge is a seeing. Meister Eckhart and the other Neoplatonic philosophers continued the argument that Plato initiated. This is not an instance of Gnosticism in that the successors of Plato in the Christian tradition are not introducing new material but are extending Plato’s philosophy. At the center of the controversies about Meister Eckhart’s alleged departure from Christian doctrine is the oneness with God. Here, Professor Schürmann acts like a good editor. He painstakingly draws out pertinent distinctions to demonstrate Meister Eckhart’s adherence to tradition. It is interesting in this light to consider what Saint Thomas Aquinas has said on some of these same issues. One can see, too, that Meister Eckhart is a good deal closer to Saint Thomas than is generally thought. Saint Thomas's writings are full of references to Neoplatonic philosophers, but he also actively engages with their ideas. Though exploring this is beyond this paper's scope, Saint Thomas’s commentary of the Christian Neoplatonist Pseudo Dionysius primarily supports this point. We also need to recall that the period in which all this unfolded was a period in history marked by the democratization of religion. More importantly, Meister Eckhart’s time was informed by the democratization of theology. Meister Eckhart’s writings and personal commitment to that project are noteworthy in this context. His decision to teach women in religious orders advanced theology, a historical *breakthrough* . There are some notable debates that Professor Schürmann addressed in this work. Perhaps chief among these is the overly close connection between the writings of Meister Eckhart and that of the late Heidegger. It had been suggested that Martin Heidegger’s interest in Zen Buddhism was thought to include that of Meister Eckhart. Waiting upon Being and detachment or releasement were similar in these three schools of thought. Professor Schürmann viewed this as a form of syncretism, the mashing up of ideas that seem similar but have important distinctions. For Professor Schürmann, the absolute absence of the faculty of the will in Meister Eckhart’s work distinguished him from these other philosophies. It is striking that Professor Schürmann repeatedly cites texts where Meister Eckhart sees the highest form of knowledge as purely a feature of the intellect. He even goes so far as to note that the will is almost absent from Meister Eckhart’s philosophy of mind.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nReiner Schürmann was Chair of Philosophy at the Graduate Faculty of the New School for Social Research and a celebrated teacher from the mid-70s until he died in 1973. He is best known as a late modern critic of established paradigms. He was, above all else, an extraordinary philosopher of history. His idea of the importance of scrutinizing historical ideas is best expressed in a line from his early work, that of *understanding history through its reversals* .\n\nProfessor Schürmann’s early work on the Medieval Philosopher Meister Eckhart displayed the depth and subtlety of his thought. It was the topic of his Sorbonne dissertation, later published as Meister Eckhart, Mystic and Philosopher, in 1978. A later edited edition was published in 2001 by David Applebaum. The philosophical hermeneutics of these works are spellbinding in their detail and nuance. In this work, we have one of Meister Eckhart’s philosophical concepts. That is the play of the three: God, man, and world. Each chapter unfurls a different one concerning the philosophy of God, the philosophy of the human mind, and the various ciphers the world offers through history, literature, and religion.\n\nIt is then, in this context, that an early work by the late philosopher Reiner Schürmann on Meister Eckhart should be considered. Schürmann’s work, *Meister Eckhart, Mystic, and Philosopher,* sets forth an important and timely account of human identity. Reiner Schürmann’s account illuminates the depth and nuance of human relationships. He does so in a way that puts the human capacity for relating to one another and the world center stage. \t\t\t\t\tSchürmann uses the example of an individual listening to a musical performance. When the music begins, both the listener and performer are distinct in their identities. As the music plays, though, both listener and performer become engrossed by the music—the three: listener, performer, and music are united in a single identity.\n\nWhat are the implications of this? Is it true? Are there other contemporary examples that support this account?\n\n“ *Meister Eckhart undertakes the risk of speculative mysticism, explaining under philosophical guise the overwhelming closeness of the Origen beyond God. That this clothing is full of holes suggests the fire that consumed him.”*\n\nReiner Schürmann, *Meister Eckhart Mystic &amp; Philosopher*\n\nThe quote above underscores the originality of Meister Eckhart and his courage. The very use of the analogy of fire is an ancient and profound one. In addition to its ancient use and repeated use by Heraclitus, it is also used to speak about the danger posed by delving too deeply into life’s mysteries. Schürmann’s astounding mentor, Professor Jeanne-Hustache, invoked it in her study of the Rhineland Mystics. Is the danger real? One need only think about the late work of Carl Jung, who, even though he was one of the greatest minds to study the psyche, paid a horrific price for his descent into the unfathomable. It is one of the goals of this present study to examine, with the help of Professor Schürmann’s extraordinarily subtle mind, the reasons for this. \t\tSchürmann’s exposition of Meister Eckhart’s philosophy is grounded in a comprehensive understanding of Plato. At the same time, though, it is a synthesis, as was Eckhart’s thought, of the nuances within the Neoplatonist tradition. As Eckhartian scholars such as Bernard McGinn and Schürmann do, it is important to note that Meister Eckhart’s original contribution is critical at some important junctures.\n\nReiner Schürmann’s explication of Eckhart’s thought also includes a richly textured disclosure of applied Christian hermeneutics. For Schürmann, it is difficult to overemphasize the influence of Origen on the Christian hermeneutical tradition of which Eckhart was a descendent. For example, in his lectures at the Graduate Faculty of the New School on Heidegger’s Being and Time, Schürmann noted the importance of hermeneutics. In this regard, most scholars focus on the importance of William Dilthey. This influence is undoubtedly important, but Schürmann viewed Origen as the primary figure in this tradition.\n\nIn the case of Meister Eckhart, this is worth noting because, for Eckhart as for Origen, Sacred Writ provides the imagery, metaphors, and narratives that serve as the gateway to the first principles—philosophical in nature—that underlie texts.\n\nThis presents an obvious challenge to those who are interested in assessing these principles and Eckhart’s specific argument without the limitations posed by theological nuances and literary debates that surround the texts.\n\nThe solution is to focus on those philosophical concepts that are identified by Schürmann, especially as those principles and concepts shed light on some of the traditional problems of philosophy.\n\nPerigrinal ontology, as I hope to show in this paper, reflects a different approach to ontology—the study of being per se. As Schürmann’s analysis underscores, “The disturbing power of Eckhart’s theory of releasement consists precisely in the transformation of a psychological or moral concept into an ontological one. Man’s way of being turned into God’s way of being” (Schürmann, 1978, p.223). As we will see, detachment for Eckhart consists not only in riddance of representation but entails a qualitative or positive change. It is not merely, Schürmann reminds us, a matter of attitude (Schürmann, 1978, p. 223).\n\nThis is a crucial point, and we will return to it later.\n\n**The Ground of Perigrinal Ontology**\n\nWhat Reiner Schürmann is attempting to undertake in his work is the delineation of a unique ontology and a radical concept of the self. Schürmann’s account of original ontology should be understood in the following way. Like the peregrine falcon, the self is best thought of as constantly “underway.” This entails the negation of essentialist accounts of the self. Unlike other non-essentialist philosophies, such as Jean-Paul Sartre’s, owing to one’s radical freedom, one is not fleeing from identification with things. As Sartre puts it in his early work on Intentionality, “If impossible though it may be, you could enter *into* consciousness, you would be seized by a whirlwind and thrown back outside, in the thick of the dust, near the tree, for consciousness has no *inside* . Precisely this being-beyond-itself, this absolute flight, this refusal to be a substance is what makes it be a consciousness” (Sartre, 1939).\n\nNor is it the same as Hegel’s grounded teleology—a teleology that is adamantly nontranscendental. As Hegel puts it in his *Preface* to the *Phenomenology* , “It was on this account that certain thinkers long ago took the void to be the principle of movement, when they conceived the moving principle to be the negative element, though they had not yet thought of it as self. While this negative factor appears in the first instance as a dissimilarity, as an inequality, between ego and object, it is just as much the inequality of substance with itself. What takes place outside it, to be an activity directed against it, is its own doing, its activity; and substance shows that it is subject.” Hegel adds that “Being is entirely mediated” (Hegel, Phenomenology, 97.1967).\n\nHegel’s indebtedness to Eckhart is interesting and worth noting, even if briefly, in this context. His concept of the Absolute is one of the lasting debates and genuine enigmas about Hegel’s philosophy. The religious depiction of this, famously depicted by Hegel’s description of his Logic, is that it represents God before the onset of creation. The unfolding of this self-grasping by the Absolute is the content of religion and philosophy and his work, The Phenomenology of Spirit. How can this be? Is not such an account an affront to human history and the most basic tenets of most religions?\n\nThe answer to this question is found in Eckhart’s understanding of God—the God that is beyond names and images. “The Godhead” is the term that is often used to express this idea. What Meister Eckhart touches on is the idea that the very idea of God, famously understood by Anslem to mean “That then which, nothing greater can be thought,” is at variance with our discussions about God. As soon as one begins to discuss God and set about making distinctions, one immediately moves away from Anselm’s use of the term—or most other uses of the word.\n\nInstead, Eckhart wants us to think that beyond all distinctions, limitations, and oppositions, the is simply What is—the One. For Eckhart, its overflow continuously begets the Word, and like breath, Spirit. The phenomenology of this overflow and speech is profoundly original. It is the case that God is nothing. For Hegel, this idea becomes that of a self-positing subject, an idea used by others in the German tradition, such as Fichte. Finally, it is important to underscore that this idea has far deeper roots in philosophy. Tradition. It traces to Plato’s dialogue, *The Parmenides* . One core idea in that dialogue is that the One is such a deep and nuanced idea, including all oppositions and distinctions, that nothing is definitive or final. Hence, the conclusion is that the One either is or is not!\n\nDetachment in Meister Eckhart has a radical element to it—it locates the basis for existence in an unfurling of the intellect and cognition. The way that Reiner Schürmann explicates detachment leaves no doubt that this is one of the most powerful critiques of anthropocentrism ever written. Detachment is presented under the symbolism of virginity—an idea with deep roots in Sacred Writ. The *Book of Solomon* alludes to it, but so do many of the writings of the prophets. Sometimes, it will appear about a naturally occurring event, such as a single cloud appearing on the horizon amid a severe drought. At other times, it will be signified by a state of mind. This aspect of one’s relationship is expressed powerfully by this statement by Johannes Scotus Eriugena, “God, in creating all things, creates himself in all things” (I.P. Sheldon-Williams, 1967 p431).\n\nThis statement requires considerable analysis. For, if one asks further, how is God present in the world of created things since God is super-substantial? St. Thomas Aquinas provides the clearest explanation of this. The perfections of things participate in God’s benevolence, but not as something among things. As St. Thomas writes in his study of Divine Names by Blessed Dionysius, “Since he is the cause of all existing things, himself is nothing among existing things” (St. Thomas Aquinas, 2021, p. 45). St. Thomas notes further on this topic that quoting Blessed Dionysius, the love by which God loves existing things is productive of goodness in them; and on account of this, he says that the good itself causally pre-exists *in the good* , that is, in God, *by excess* (as all things which are in creatures about perfection are more excellently in God, and therefore he had said that the divine love is of the good (ibid *.* , 181).\n\nAs Professor Schürmann notes, Eckhart’s idea of detachment reflects an anti-bourgeois understanding. It could be read as foreshadowing Left critiques of capitalism's pollution and falsification of consciousness. Twentieth-century political thought is full of references to the manufacture and manipulation of false needs, so it does have a materialist aspect. However, there is far more to it.\n\nThere are several influences at work in detachment. One of these influences is Aristotle’s concept of an active intellect. This is important because one of the comparisons is sometimes between the late Heidegger and Meister Eckhart. While there are important similarities, there are also important distinctions. The will is missing in Eckhart’s concept of detachment, and Reiner Schürmann goes as far as to say that there is no trace of the will in Meister Eckhart’s account of detachment. For Heidegger, as he notes repeatedly in his lectures in Discourses on Thinking, the will is used to detach from calculative thought.\n\nEckhart’s solution is precisely the above-noted active intellect. It sees into the essences of things or, in Aristotelian terms, their forms and, by that, has a deeper understanding of reality. Though not a part of the will (as intellect), its function is a relational one—it establishes a relationship between the thinking subject and its object. Schürmann unearths a fascinating quote from St. Thomas Aquinas to establish this pivotal point. Schürmann presents this quote, “The understood subject and the understanding subject are one being, just as the sensed object and the sensing subject are one being.”\n\nThis is an extremely subtle line of thought that Schürmann is unfurling. His analysis delves deeply into the Neoplatonic tradition and follows the idea through both Christian and secular sources as well as Western as well as Eastern accounts. This aspect of Eckhart takes one into the intricacies of Christian theology. This is beyond the focus of this study, but it is worth mentioning here. Eckhart uses the birth metaphor to explain the mutuality of one’s relationship with God. The Word of God, the Son, is born anew in the mind of the beloved disciple of any age. On this point, as Schürmann notes, there are numerous Biblical and authoritative sources of support. Where Eckhart departs from this tradition is when he maintains that the Son or the Word is born in God (the Father) as well.\n\nIt seems less controversial if we take this out of theology and reimagine what Eckhart says in secular terms. When, for example, an individual loves another, there is, of course, an outpouring of affection towards the beloved. However, is it only one direction? If we remain focused on the lover of the beloved exclusively (for sometimes love can be unrequited), there is another question that is suggested. What is the beloved's status in the lover's mind? One of the seminal breakthroughs in philosophy was Hegel’s depiction of the double nature of consciousness. Here, one can say that the beloved resides in the lover's mind.\n\nThese kinds of questions are highly speculative, but they highlight the direction Meister Eckhart’s path has marked for us. It is important to note that what is being discussed here is the person's ontology, and this life category is more fundamental than our empirical existence. Put differently, it is Eckhart’s philosophy of mind and not the neuropsychology of the brain. Certainly, regarding the brain’s structure and processes, memory is highly dynamic. It involves many biological processes and extensive neurological coordination.\n\nAt the same time, there is empirical support for what Meister Eckhart is bringing before us. Carl Jung’s profound contribution to therapy and addiction recovery programs hinges on his contribution to the founders of the alcohol recovery program Alcoholics Anonymous. There are important contact points between Eckhartian detachment and the core concept of a higher power. As one scholar notes for Carl Jung, the self is “simply an indication of the primal, unfathomable ground of the psyche.\n\nSelf-reflection on the unity of consciousness has led some philosophers, such as Sartre, to posit the phenomenology of transcendence as such. Sartre’s early formulation of the pre-reflective cogito is one example. Jung views the self as a deeper reality that can be a working hypothesis and that can have a unique place in the mind. As Jacobi puts it in his study of Jung, “the self is also a psychic category and can be experienced as such; to depart from the language of psychology, we might call it the ‘central fire,’ our share in God, or Meister Eckhart’s ‘little spark.’ .\n\nFrom the point of view of religion, nothing in Eckhart’s thought is more controversial than the specific way in which the above culminates in a shared identity between God and the individual. As Reiner Schürmann notes, it was precisely this idea that led to his appearance before Church authorities. ￼ There is, as discussed earlier, a Hegelian reading that is far more mainstream. Left unasked is a more important question for contemporary thinkers: What does it say about the human condition that the basis of all of this is the human capacity for being open to and establishing relationships? Especially ones that transcend the rote behavior of everyday familiarity.\n\nHere, there are other examples one could mention. One example is the relationship between student and teacher. Hans Georg Gadamer notes in his commentary on Hegel’s dialectic that one can see in this relationship just such a transformational moment. Gadamer invites us to think of the dialectical relationship between the two not in a dark way but instead as a joining together to reach another level. Certainly, one could add that this is not the case in all teacher-student relationships. In many ways, the instruction is merely that of the delivery of information in a rote manner.\n\nOther examples, such as the one Gadamer mentions in his interview, involve the mutual shared identity that Meister Eckhart describes. The epitome of this shared identity is that of lovers. One need only think of the sculptor Rodin’s famous piece, aptly called *La Main de Dieu* , to see a powerful and subtle illustration of this point. It is worth noting that in the piece, the shared identity of two people is grounded in the overarching shared identity of the now one with God.\n\nThere is also the important example used by Reiner Schürmann--that of music. When the listener is engaged with a performance and the performer is likewise engaged, there is a third element or identity that is shared—both audience member and performer are changed by the experience. Might this not also be the case between God and the individual—is God changed, as absurd as this seems, by the shared love? On this point, as Reiner Schürmann notes, Meister Eckhart is alone among Christian thinkers, even those who, like Origen, are the most speculative.\n\nWhat emerges from Schürmann’s study is a philosophy of liberation—one that is grounded in relationships. As noted, by advancing a radically non-essentialist conception of the self, it is, on this score at least, very much at home among contemporary debates on the nature of the self. Eckhart has left behind not only entitative ontology, as Schürmann reminds us, but the very symbols and language of scholasticism. Schürmann himself draws our attention to this when he sums up the principles that inform Eckhart’s theory:\n\n“The tradition in which Meister Eckhart stands... begins with the writings of Clement of Alexandria, who still used a vocabulary close to that of the Bible. It underwent a philosophical development with Hippolytus and especially Origen, and it blossomed out into a systematized theology of union with God in Methodius, Gregory of Nazianzus, and Maximus” (Schürmann, 1978, p.26).\n\n**Time and Perigrinal Ontology**\n\nThroughout the tradition, philosophers have followed the empirical ordering of time. There are many significant departures from the everyday account; the tradition considers the world's experience to follow the movement of consciousness and the sequencing of new moments. This baseline within approaches to time emphasizes process and entails either the movement of consciousness, the movement of the world, or some combination of both. ￼\n\nThe experience of urgency, especially when it comes to acting, can be exacerbated either by the increased tempo of the external environment or the psychological pressures on consciousness. Again, this can also involve the relationship between external and internal time consciousness, as in Hegel or Husserl. What Eckhart is suggesting, and Schürmann is underscoring in his study, is a different comportment towards time. This involves the process of releasement (detachment). In detachment, one becomes open to a primal now. Schürmann notes the echoes of an idea in Plato at this juncture, especially the Meno , and states that: “Without a great risk of error we can state that the true source behind the paradoxical expression “as free as he was when he was not” is the Platonic doctrine of the preexistence of the soul, which Eckhart knew perhaps, though somewhat altered, through Origen.” (Schürmann, 2001,.12)\n\nOne way of thinking about Meister Eckhart’s approach is that Being appears under the auspices of several questions. The one most often associated with thinking is introduced by the word *what* . The question, what is this being, is the usual expression of this.\n\nThe other question is *why.* *For example, why are these events happening? This aspect of questioning about being is at the center of scientific inquiry. It is easily related to the question of what. What has happened, or what is this and why, are closely related. Medicine, for example, proceeds along this path of inquiry. The diagnosis implies both what and why.*\n\nThe word that, on the other hand, stands by itself regarding time. *That* something exists in time invites a different type of inquiry. It could invite a scientific inquiry, such as why it is *that* this thing is here. Or it could invite the word what—what is this *that* is here and now? In these instances, though, note that the question precedes them. In fact, qua the original experience that something is, the words what and why, or even how, are de-ontological. Their movement is away from the initial and primary experience of Being. This was explicated famously by Leibniz, and it is the major focus of Heidegger’s philosophy.\n\nFor Meister Eckhart, this residue is qualitatively different from the breakthrough experience he describes in his philosophy. This peculiarity is helpful because it places some of his thinking on this topic in a secular context.\n\nIt is worth noting that the distinction between these words, and, more importantly, the ontology that underlies them, was a major area of focus for Medieval philosophers such as Saint Thomas Aquinas. Saint Thomas Aquinas emphasizes the point by acutely problematizing how one formulates Being. His depiction of it as a relationship between *that being* and *what being* remains a formulation that underscores the close, almost causal connection between the temporality of *Ens* and *Esse* . St. Thomas Aquinas sees an additional relationship between *Quod est* and *Esse* (Aquinas, 1949, p. 48). For Aquinas, this relationship also requires that any ontological account of Reality must come to terms with the idea of a necessary Being.\n\nFor Meister Eckhart, when we make our way around the world, two modalities of time correspond to these two ways of approaching Being. Releasement is towards the being of things, in contrast to the daily ordering and experience of temporality. Instead of implying de-ontology, releasement invites ad-ontology. For example, it is unlike socially constructed time and is correlated with the pace of consciousness itself. It is because of this movement that a primal experience of time seems out of reach. With detachment from the onrushing of the everyday world, a different possibility presents itself. As Reiner Schürmann describes, “Each time and since the intellect lets itself be, it enters into the fullness of the instant, which is eternity” (Schürmann, 2001: 32). It is the intellect and that the will that is the relevant human faculty. In. Schürmann notes that the will is diminished in favor of the intellect. The temporality of detachment, as Schürmann describes it, is related to one’s grasp of representation. An interesting quote that establishes this is, “To move among things in detachment is to live *in one sole and same light with God”* (Schürmann,2001, p. 33).\n\nSchürmann describes it thusly: “Temporality in Eckhart is a moving among things as they are in their essence.” (Schürmann, 2001, p. 33) Precisely because the apparent being of things is nothing, such a releasement towards things represents an approach to the problem of change and time first broached in ancient Greek philosophy. Of course, the major figures are Parmenides and Heraclitus, but also Plato’s work, Parmenides, where Plato studies this precise issue in detail.\n\nBy way of analogy, the outline of a similar idea is found in Edmund Husserl’s philosophy. Husserl argues that in attempting to encounter things in their essence, they needed to bracket their appearance under the natural perspective. Like Eckhart, Husserl emphasizes the intellect and its ability to detach. For Husserl, this is for vastly distinct reasons.\n\nViewed in this light, detachment is a two-fold process wherein the *telos* expresses a relational ontology. That is, first, there is an intellectual detachment (Schürmann,2001, p.13), and second, there is an objective detachment. However, because the end is relational (as ontology), there is a qualitative shift in the self. Eckhart departs dramatically from Neoplatonism on this point, for detachment is meant not to bring one away from the world with all that implies (higher and lower, rest and labor, sacred and profane) but exists instead to bring one more truly into the world. “Detachment,” Schürmann reminds us, “carries a mark of worldliness” since it designates a being among things, without restraint.”\n\nOne of Meister Eckhart's most stunning ideas is that the detached individual enters a different temporality. It is the eternal moment, and one share the same time as God. As Schürmann puts it, “To move among things in detachment is to live *in one sole and same light with God”* (Schürmann,2001, p. 33). Therein, one departs from the succession of ordinary time.\n\nFilm director Ingmar Bergman discloses this after his masterpiece, *The Seventh Seal.* In it, the character John experiences a “strawberries and milk” moment. Such moments, Bergman suggests, are akin to what Karl Jaspers called ciphers—transcendental experiences of hidden eternity and meaning. In this one, John sees his departed companions dancing together in mirth and affection. This moment stands in extraordinarily stark contrast to Bergman’s unfolding of the quintessential existential themes of death, despair, madness, social pathology, and illness.\n\n**Perigrinal Ontology and Human Identity in Eckhart.**\n\nPerigrinal ontology, as noted at the outset, maintains that human identity is not fixed, static, or essential but is emergent. The idea has found expression in the idea of the wayfarer or pilgrim. It is not merely a matter of religious doctrine, though, for one can be thoroughly at home with the ideas of essentialism and still subscribe to the label of wayfarer. The essential component, the one at the heart of Eckhart’s idea of original ontology, is that of radical freedom. The Augustinian idea that God is creating all things, at the same time creating himself in all things, means that for Eckhart, one is in continuous or perpetual relationship to God in the world as well as God in the soul. The distinction itself evinces the two-fold directionality of ontology, mind to world and world to mind.\n\nEckhart’s combination of wandering identity echoes the famous statement by Saint Paul: “For in him we live and move and have our being” (Acts 17:28). In a secular way, wandering identity and the unique delineation of gestalt that it evinces and is grounded in seem to replace the usual dichotomies of subject-object. In a theological sense, this means that other dichotomies, such as man-God and immanence and transcendence, are deepened by a different ontological formulation—that of “there is God with us.” ￼\n\nFor Eckhart, wandering or operative identity is more properly thought of as a relational praxis. It is, though, a vastly different idea of praxis—one that is deeply rooted in ancient philosophy. Today, when the term praxis is used, it usually means informing and self-informing activity, often political. The meaning that is being used here, again, one that traces to ancient philosophy and especially the writings and teachings of the Neoplatonists, is one that Hannah Arendt expanded upon in her history of philosophy--- *The Life of the Mind* . In that work, Arendt describes praxis, following Aristotle, this way.\n\nFor Hannah Arrant. The essence of praxis is *vita activa* . It is a nuanced approach that she invites us to. Into. She begins by noting that the highest form of thinking was, for ancient philosophers, a form of contemplation, a seeing. Arendt writes, “The thinking activity, according to Plato—the soundless dialogue we carry on with ourselves, serves only to open the eyes of the mind.\n\nMoreover, even the Aristotelian nous and nous is an organ for seeing and beholding the truth.” ￼ Arendt goes on to underscore that the telos of thinking is contemplation—a mental oasis. The intellectual history of humanity moved in a secular direction wherein thinking was devoted to science. Science, though, as Arendt notes, rests upon math. Math, interestingly, though, is the mind “playing with itself” and is radically non-empirical. So, math, in this account, entails non-active thinking. It is passive even while allowing the practitioners to *see* the laws of nature.\n\n**The Example of Music**\n\nReiner Schürmann’s study uses the example of music to suggest an important aspect of the ontology of such thinking. As he writes, “Properly speaking, perfect listening implies that the distinction between the soloist, on one side, and the listener, on the other, is no longer true. Through the unique event of the song that enraptures us, one identical being accomplishes itself. Thus, the fundamental determination of existence is “operative identity” or, in homage to Aristotle, “energetic identity.” (Schürmann, p. 105) It is worth highlighting the relationship between music and math—wherein musical notes are arranged according to number.\n\nAnother analogy that might serve to underscore this point can be derived from Aquinas’ negative theology. The way of detachment in Eckhart is akin to the progressive de-determination of the attributes of God. One can say that the way of detachment brings about a relational praxis, which was first outlined in the scholastic theory of negation. Schürmann delineates this by asking: “In his program of exclusion of differences and the multiple, how does Eckhart determine the identity which supports and demands this putting to death of the scattered self? The difficulty lies... in avoiding the error of representing it as the ontic identity of a universal mega substance with itself” (Schürmann, 2001, p.108). Here, Schürmann’s reservations against syncretism regarding Eckhart and Heidegger seem especially relevant. For Heidegger, of course, Being is anything but a universal mega substance, and while this caution seems to apply more to other interpretations of Eckhart, its spirit also includes Heidegger. For Heidegger, it will be recalled, especially in his later works, that the relationship between Being and beings as entities is complex. Caputo draws this out in his account of Heidegger, wherein he emphasizes the Heideggerian maxim that Being recedes as beings are focused on. For Eckhart, by contrast, the encounter with the Godhead is not a matter of dwelling in a poetic but seeing. It is an overflow of living.\n\nRelational praxis comprises Meister Eckhart's ontology. It is a form of praxis that becomes aware of itself in detachment or is involved in what Schürmann refers to as “the play of the three.” Eckhart refers to the different moments of this way as dissimilarity, similarity, identity, and dehiscence.\n\nThe last moment is the play of the three, and what defines it is the removal of the will. During previous moments, the will is active. Even so, the will is best understood in its previous instances as relational praxis (forming and informing activity).\n\nFor the individual who is “underway” or related to reality in an original way, as opposed to an entitative posture, there is a “new commerce with things.” Schürmann maintains that this follows from the detached individual’s existence.\n\nIt is in this sense that Schürmann can maintain that: “to claim the ultimacy of the “there is,” understood as an event, obviously runs counter to all efforts to read Eckhart in a theistic perspective” (Schürmann, 1978, p, 258). Once again, we can see the usefulness of the music analogy. The kind of shared experience that takes place in a musical event excludes the idea of sameness or synonymy. To be perigrinal or wandering is, by definition, not to be identical. Saint Thomas Aquinas was aware of this position and its advancement among earlier writers but was careful to avoid expressing it because he was concerned about error and misunderstanding. The situation is not the same with later writers such as Heidegger.\n\nThe upshot of viewing perigrinal ontology within the framework of relational praxis\n\nis that the “selfsame” in Meister Eckhart and Heidegger is to be sought not in comparisons of Eckhartian theology and Heideggerian destiny but in the “there is” of Eckhart and the “being there” of the early Heidegger, or in a word, the world.     Telos, in other words, which was so important to  Saint Thomas, is not a part of Meister Eckhart.\n\nI suggest highlighting some of the differences among philosophers on this point. For Saint Thomas Aquinas, God alone is his own act of being. All other beings receive their act of being, that is, their status as something, by someone else. In one of Plato’s most metaphysical writings, The Parmenides, Plato reports Parmenides as maintaining the One, which has been but also unity and oneness (Plato, 1984, pp. 936-937). Along these lines, Jacques Maritan posits that one’s encounter with being and being also implies unity and oneness (Maritan, 1968, p. 2). A comparison of these and some other philosophers on this point may help to underscore the issue of telos and being.\n\n**Being (that which is) is:**\n\n**Plato\t  being, unity, oneness**\n\n**Saint Thomas Aquinas’s\tSupreme Being is self-subsisting; others have telos.**\n\n**Edmund Husserl\tConsciousness provides an animating construal, and experience is teleological.**\n\n**Meister Eckhart\tWandering’s identity defines beings. The experience of God is non-teleological, as God is eternity, not sequential or temporal.**\n\n**Martin Heidegger\t\tBeing is fully disclosed in an ephemeral experience.**\n\nIt is in the moment of dehiscence that many of these ideas coalesce. Here, we see the\n\nTelos is an important point in Professor Schürmann's discussion of the temporality of detachment in Meister Eckhart. For when we are among things as detached, we live in the same light as God. Eckhart also maintains that things are thereby laid open. How things are laid bare is also quite compelling. Professor Schurmann describes it by evoking an unusual work from early Botany. It is the concept of dehiscence. This is when flowers or plants, seemingly on their own, burst through their skins or covering and spill forth like a cornucopia of seeds. The implications here for thinking about art and poetry are considerable. To use the writings of the later Heidegger for a moment, the worldliness of the world rises as on a country path before us. Unlike in Heidegger, the insights here are not fleeting upsurges of disclosure but rather a new temporality of ideas. One subsists in them and does not succumb to the bypassing of sequential time.\n\nProfessor Schürmann maintains an important continuity between the Neoplatonic philosopher Proclus and Meister Eckhart, who, he notes, was very well versed in The Book of Causes by Proclus. It may be helpful to recall that Plato maintained that One, as a feature of being, also organizes reality into a contextual order. Our minds also enjoy this feature as they can combine a diversity of experiences and ideas into one. Here, one can already see the contours of the role of Be *griff* in Hegel. Hegelian scholars such as Quinten Lauer maintained that Plato’s Parmenides were of great interest and importance to Hegel.\n\nAt the heart of Eckhart’s idea of wandering identity is the provisional acclamation of the individual’s divinity. This is a highly controversial postulate, and Professor Schürmann builds on it by referring to the wording of Pseudo-Dionysius. The phrase  “spark of divine fire” represents a super-sensible mind feature. As was earlier postulated by Plato in Parmenides, the human mind is rife with oppositional thinking of this and that pair of opposites. It cannot escape from the constant development of conceptual thought through progressively more truthful or complete adumbrations. The situation is different in the apex of the mind. There, as in Plato, the mind can discern the One as both are super-sensible. The One, in other words, is detached from the lower oppositional dialectic that comprises mundane human thought. The mind “rests,” to borrow a word from Saint Augustine’s Neoplatonism, in a place of eternity beyond the sequences of time. It is in this shared space that God and man, according to Meister Eckhart, share an identity.\n\nThe music analogy might add some clarity here. Just as the listener and the performer share unity in an encounter with a song, God and human beings become one in a meeting beyond the sensible. This indwelling with the Divine is beyond images and words.\n\nAt this point, it may be helpful to consider some observations about Meister Eckhart’s philosophy of mind. At first glance, it appears that Meister Eckhart had strayed into the thorny bushes of Gnosticism. However, on further consideration, nothing here did not first appear in Plato’s philosophy of mind. In Plato’s account, the ability of humans to reason can lead them to consider abstract realities and ideas such as math. It is not the existence of math that is the key to this idea but rather the higher powers of the mind. We can all recall math students in our early grades who came up with the correct solution but with different reasoning.\n\nMoreover, of course, there are many permutations of math. Within the tradition of philosophy, most writers accurately but incompletely ascribe this to the Platon idea of the forms and the universals. Viewed differently, it instead hinges on the capacity of the human mind to surmount the various levels of knowledge. In its highest form, at its apex, human reason is not a matter of data assembly and distinction but rather, as Plato describes it, a seeing.\n\nMeister Eckhart describes the same philosophy of mind. The key differences are the use of theological language and biblical references. So, given this reading of Reiner Schürmann’s account of Meister Eckhart, the claim of Gnosticism does not fit the text.\n\nThe more profound philosophical question is whether this philosophy is credible. On this score, one should consider that a union with a super-mundane reality has existed since our earliest times and in most places. For example, many of the world’s religions include a mystical tradition. This is not evidence, of course, but it does suggest something. Unless one is willing to believe that such a universal and historical experience is a mass delusion, it is at least worth considering. There are differences among these traditions, and they are significant. The question of technique is one of them. For example, the meditation techniques of a Zen Buddhist are very different from the kind of dark emptiness recommended by the anonymous author of *The Cloud of Unknowing* . However, these more significant points are less relevant.\n\nMeister Eckhart’s philosophy of mind is conjoined with his philosophy of God in his depiction of the play of the three: God, man, and world. It is What radically non-stasis. One outcome of the play of the three is a transformation in the character of existence. The kind of presence that Eckhart describes as following from the play of the three is presented by him this way: “God, man, and world are united in the play of the three,” in a reformatted temporality that is also suggestive of yet another teaching of Heidegger - his idea of ecstatic temporality from Being and Time. It may be recalled that in Heidegger’s account, authentic projection unifies the scattered experience of time that is the consequence of the fallenness of average everydayness. One becomes an integrated whole once one takes a position on one's existence.\n\nThis is akin to Meister Eckhart’s idea of “wandering identity,” which proceeds along the road of detachment - a dialectic of “voluntary disappropriation” and the “development of a state: the original liberty of which man never lost at the basis of his being. “In so doing, past, present, and future are replaced by an “indwelling” in the eternal now.\n\nFor Reiner Schürmann, one can see that Meister Eckhart has left entitative ontology entirely. At the same time, this is an ontology of function, or instead, it is operational. This is because Schürmann maintains one’s spiritual relationship. (Schürmann, 2001, pp. 170-171). Considering Schürmann’s use of the word “functional” in this context is interesting. This suggests that while one may, at any given moment, take a conceptual snapshot of this original ontology, it in no way captures the totality of one’s existence. It presents a freeze frame that will delineate the functional distinctness of the human being in the moment of mundane existence. Mundane existence, though, only tells a part of the story. According to Eckhart, man is anything but mundane. The correct version, for Eckhart, is that which, to keep with the visual analogy, is present in the moving picture or the original view - the operational unity of God, Soul, and World. The individual human being, as a separate and distinct entity frozen in the moment, is an abstraction from a more actual context of life where there is nothing so much as a play of the three. The play of the three is a representation of something that exists as exposition and analysis. In experience, the three are experienced as one, as we saw with the example of the listener, musician, and the music. Again, Meister Eckhart’s depiction here is not as novel as it appears. For, as Professor Schürmann notes, “Plato, in the Parmenides, had already reasoned in this way: id the One is not, all things are dissolved on disorder, but they are visibly regulated according to an order, so the One exists” (Schürmann, 2001, p. 37).\n\nThis amounts to a deification of man and was the crux of his interrogators’ charges against Meister Eckhart. The nuance here, a pivotal one in terms of Meister Eckhart’s adherence to Church tradition, is the ongoing nature of this relationship. In Plato, as discussed earlier in the example of The Meno, this is a feature of the pre-existence of the act of being in the world. That is why, famously for Plato, knowledge is remembering. In Eckhart, this oneness is, as Professor Schürmann maintains, an operational identity.\n\nWhat operative identity means is that it can only be discerned in moments of the breakthrough to God. Alternatively, as in Saint Augustine, it can sometimes be perceived by looking back hermeneutically on one’s life. The biographical approach to perigrinal ontology has a complement when viewed in a historical context. For humanity itself is similarly underway. Increasingly, it is the case that categories of human existence, once thought to be fixed, are not seen as fluid.\n\nHistory and Releasement\n\nMany of the questions that arise from Eckhart’s ontology are united in that they all revolve around the issue of history. In fact, as Schürmann notes, it is precisely this question in Eckhart that inspired the young Hegel: “It was this concept of a totality at the beginning and at the end of releasement, unfolding itself without a why, that was to enchant Frederic Hegel five centuries later” (Schürmann, 2001, p.113). Schürmann further relates, this time in his notes, a fascinating exchange culled from Franz von Baader’s recollections of Hegel’s reaction to Eckhart. It is worth quoting: “Very often, in Berlin, I was in the company of Hegel. One day, I read him some texts about Meister Eckhart, an author he knew only by name. He was so delighted that he gave me an entire course devoted to Meister Eckhart. Ultimately, he said, “Here we have found at last what we were seeking.”\n\nAmong the many things that Hegel might have been seeking, one of them might have been a historical instantiation of the unity of content between revealed religion and philosophy. Here, as Schürmann does, I would cite Ernst Bloch as one thinker who supports viewing Hegel and Eckhart in this way. While the relationship between *arche* and *telos* as absolute was an inspiration for Hegel, there is another direction in which one may take Eckhart’s version of the absolute as relational ontology, in contrast to the one posed by Hegel. Here, the question would be: Does the play of the three have a demonstrable history, not as a phenomenology of history, where the individual gives way to the social, but where the *telos* remains with the individual? Can we discern anywhere in the history of the individual in society examples that made use of, or verified, the concept of the three that Schürmann delineates?\n\nThe influence of Eckhart’s philosophy has had some interesting detours. In some ways, this influence is even more surprising given the relative lack of interest in Eckhart by mainstream philosophy, as noted by Schürmann. For example, it is fascinating that Carl Jung used almost identical language to Hegel's in describing his initiation into Eckhart’s philosophy. In his work on Eckhart, Matthew Fox notes that Eckhart’s philosophy of releasement enthralled Jung and saw in the idea of “letting go,” a palliative for the psyche, in the therapeutic attempt to overcome consciousness. One of the most interesting, although to my mind unnoticed, outcomes in the history of philosophy have been the introduction into mainstream schools of social work and psychology, the very Eckhartian notions of “letting go” and releasement, placed there by Jung’s study of Eckhart’s philosophy. This would seem to argue for a very this-worldly application of Eckhart’s philosophy in history.\n\n**The Problem of Syncretism in Approaches to Meister Eckhart**\n\nSchürmann’s account of the philosophy of Meister Eckhart takes pains to emphasize the nuances that are necessary for a complete aunt of Eckhart’s philosophy. The reason for this caution is the problem of syncretism: the tendency to equate ideas without sufficient attention to subtle but essential distinctions. For Schürmann, the problem of syncretism has bled through many of the analyses of Eckhart’s philosophy. The book begins with a cautionary word against syncretism from one direction - those which place too great an emphasis on Meister Eckhart’s proximity to the mystical tradition and ends with an equally compelling case against syncretism from another direction - that of too close a comparison of Meister Eckhart with Zen Buddhism. Between these two trends, Schürmann locates the strong points of distinction between the teachings of Meister Eckhart and that of Martin Heidegger, one of the significant tendencies in Eckhartian scholarship.\n\nIn sum, *Meister Eckhart Mystic &amp; Philosopher* is an attempt to clear a path from which to view the originality of Eckhart’s philosophy, and most especially what Schürmann considers Eckhart’s penultimate philosophical teaching - the *play of the three as perigrinal ontology. (“philarchive.org”)*\n\nSchürmann’s cautions against syncretism have been addressed by several authors since Meister Eckhart’s Mystic and Philosopher was published. Caputo’s works on Meister Eckhart, Martin Heidegger, and Saint Thomas Aquinas addressed the issue in some detail. “It remains the case though that the philosophical element in Meister Eckhart’s work elicits the tendency to locate his ideas in other philosophies, or moments of philosophy.” All too often, the growth of interest in medieval life has often meant the reproduction of these syncretic approaches to Eckhart, as opposed to the one authored by Schürmann. The latter, however, makes a strong claim to being the authentic voice of Eckhart.\n\nSo, the difficulty of syncretism is one long-standing, and we need to look at the classic and influential work by Johan Huizinga, republished as part of an ongoing interest in the medieval world. In Huizinga’s work, *The Autumn of the Middle Ages,* in the section where he is discussing Eckhart, for example, we find this commentary:\n\n“Most mystic statements show synchronically, mixed, and blended phases. They already existed in India, were fully developed in Pseudo-Dionysius, who is the source of all Christian mysticism, and are revived in the German mysticism of the fourteenth century.” Johan Huizinga, 1995, p.258)\n\nReiner Schürmann’s contrasting view of Meister Eckhart argues that Eckhart is most properly understood as a philosopher who developed a unique ontology, which Schürmann terms *perigrinal* . This ontology is used by Eckhart to usher in a new formulation of the self, known as wandering identity. As noted, Schürmann’s delineation of Eckhart’s philosophy takes place against the backdrop of syncretism and, by far the most difficult form of it, concerns Heidegger’s philosophy, especially the philosophy of the late Heidegger. One instance of this that is noted by Schürmann concerns Caputo’s early analysis: “But I must confess that I am ill at ease with parallels between two thinkers so far apart from each other when these parallels become as specific as the following: Heidegger’s “recollection into being” and mysticism at large; Heidegger’s analogy between being and thinking, and Eckhart’s analogy between God and the thinking within faith; Heidegger’s “Dasein,” and Eckhart’s “ground of the soul”; Heidegger’s “Event of appropriation and Eckhart’s “birth”(Schürmann, 1978, p.255n). He uses syncretism to discuss Caputo’s article (on which his book was based). (Schürmann, 1978, p.263).\n\nA second instance is the comparison of certain ideas about Zen in connection with Eckhart, but these, too, are related to the comparisons with Heidegger. The source of these two instances, and the tendencies they represent, is the glossing of differences between Heidegger and Eckhart, a problem compounded by the fact that Heidegger himself did not discourage very strongly, and in fact, in some venues even encouraged some comparisons on the topic. The “break” with Martin Heidegger himself on an aspect of his work underscores what was for Schürmann, a defining aspect of his phenomenological approach—the distinction between the philosophical work of a thinker and their philosophical reflections on it. It is worth noting that this distinction was also viewed as a pivotal one by Edmund Husserl and was a core element of his philosophy of history.\n\nOne figure at the heart of the controversy of syncretism between Heideggerian Eckhart and Zen Buddhism is D. T. Suzuki. Of his work: *Mysticism: Christian and Buddhist* . Schürmann maintains that “Suzuki understands Eckhart correctly when he interprets the ground or “little point” in the mind as the demarcation between the immutable zone in man and everything created. Still, these formulations must not remain confined to their gnoseological context: they indicate less a faculty of knowledge than man’s ontological identity” (Schürmann, 1978, p.226).\n\n**Bibliography**\n\nAnselm, Proslogion .
