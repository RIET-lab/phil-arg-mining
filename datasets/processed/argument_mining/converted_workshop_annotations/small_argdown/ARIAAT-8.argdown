[Main Claim]: We may appreciate and engage with works that lack a human creator; these works have aesthetic value

[Main Claim]
  + [Implied author]: Aesthetic consumers mentally create an ""implied author"" 
  + [Engagement and social consensus trumps 'actual' authorship]: How people engage with art is more important than trying to ""define the essence of true authorship nor to construct a theory of an 'artificial author'.""
