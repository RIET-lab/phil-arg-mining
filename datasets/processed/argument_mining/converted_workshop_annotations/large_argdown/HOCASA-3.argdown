The paper’s main lesson is that an effective theory of analogy integrates both semantic (concept/conceptualist) structure and contextual/judgmental analysis.
 + Cajetan’s theory of analogy is a central and influential treatment in Thomistic philosophy.
    + Critics argue that Cajetan’s theory exposes weaknesses in medieval semantic assumptions.
        + Medieval semantic theory assumes words signify by discrete concepts, and proposition meaning is the sum of word meanings.
        + This theory, say critics like Ashworth and Ross, cannot capture language’s complexity and variety, especially in analogical cases.
            + To make sense of analogy, one must look at how words function in sentences and context, not just at their independent semantic features.

        + Ross claims that the classical theory of analogy is flawed because it relies on conceptualist and compositionalist assumptions.
        + Maurer and Gilson assert that Cajetan’s approach is too centered on concepts, neglecting the key role of judgment in analogy.
            + Burrell and others maintain that analogy is best understood at the level of judgment and language use, not abstract concept analysis alone.
        + Simon emphasizes that analogical unity requires partial abstraction and mental operation rooted in context, not reducible to one abstract feature.
    + Proper analysis of analogy must consider context and actual use in sentences, not just abstract word-level semantics.
        + Hochschild contends that Cajetan’s semantic analysis is compatible with attention to context, judgment, and interpretation.
        + Medieval logic often analyzed terms in the context of complete arguments and inferences, not just as isolated units.
            + Cajetan, in later chapters, insists that interpreting analogical meaning requires attention to linguistic and argumentative context.
    + Semantic and contextual/judgment-based analysis are not inherently opposed; their opposition has been overstated by some critics.
