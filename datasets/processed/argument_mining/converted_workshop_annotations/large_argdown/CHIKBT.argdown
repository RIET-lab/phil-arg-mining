Main thesis: The demise of neo-Kantianism was not a simple philosophical refutation, but emerged from changing institutional, psychological, and political climates; and rather than weakening Kant’s legacy, the interwar period produced a new phase of rigor and accuracy in Kant studies.
 + Interwar German philosophy was marked by a break with neo-Kantianism, which was blamed for the intellectual and cultural crises of the era.
    + Movements shifted to Hegel, Marx, positivism, existentialism, and phenomenology, all explicitly departing from neo-Kantian frameworks.
    + Despite its general disfavor, neo-Kantian philosophy was (philosophically) well-equipped for the Weimar world: it was antimetaphysical, promoted science, and supported social democracy and egalitarian ideals.
        + Its collapse was due not just to philosophical critique, but to institutional inertia, generational desire for novelty, and especially political circumstances—rising nationalism and anti-Semitism targeted its (often Jewish, left-leaning) leaders.
        + Ironically, the scientific and pragmatic aspirations of the Vienna Circle, positivism, and logical empiricism owed much to neo-Kantianism, even as they disavowed the label.
    + The ""crisis"" and criticism of neo-Kantianism often attacked a strawman: many critiques, especially by Marxists (e.g. Lukács), targeted neo-Kantian distortions more than Kant himself.
        + Lukács' complaints about systematic rationalism, limits of reason, and freedom are actually closer to Kant’s own self-critique and awareness than to the views of his ""school.""
        + Many in the interwar era called for going “back to Kant,” undertaking careful historical and philosophical scholarship to distinguish Kant’s own views from neo-Kantian figures.
    + The postwar period was thus marked by a revitalization of Kant research: intensive study, editing, and philology established a lasting legacy that persists into the 21st century.
