      "type": "Claim",
      "text": "Data-driven, risk-based security measures, which perform 'social sorting', inherently conflict with fundamental rights like privacy."

      "type": "Claim",
      "text": "In situational risk assessment, which avoids personal data, ethical issues still arise."

      "type": "Claim",
      "text": "Situational risk indicators can lead to structural discrimination if they disproportionately affect salient social groups (e.g., all travelers from a specific country)."

      "type": "Claim",
      "text": "Mining the darknet for situational risks can violate privacy by using information published without consent and can create a chilling effect on legitimate anonymous activities."

      "type": "Claim",
      "text": "In traveler-specific risk profiling, OSINT use raises even more severe ethical issues."

    "Untitled 7": {
      "type": "Claim",
      "text": "Obtaining valid, informed consent for OSINT profiling is highly questionable, as travelers may not be aware of all public data about them, leading to violations of 'contextual integrity'."
    },
    "Untitled 8": {
      "type": "Claim",
      "text": "OSINT profiling can create a chilling effect on legitimate expression (e.g., political criticism) for fear of negative consequences at the border."

      "type": "Claim",
      "text": "Automated profiling risks creating discriminatory 'black box' systems that unfairly target vulnerable groups."
