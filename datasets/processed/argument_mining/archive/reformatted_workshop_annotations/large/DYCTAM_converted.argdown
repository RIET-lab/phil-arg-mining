The text’s main thesis: Only a plural, open conception of Enlightenment (as in Mendelssohn) does justice to women’s actions, agency, and philosophical thought; in this view, culture, education, and enlightenment are universal and emancipatory paths for all humanity.
 + The Enlightenment is often narrated through a Kantian lens that explicitly excludes women from its processes and philosophical legacy.
    + Kant asserted that enlightenment was limited to citizens and scholars, denying the role of women as either agents or recipients.
    + This narrative marginalizes multifaceted forms of female intellectuality and sociability and derides topics pursued by women as “popular” rather than philosophical, even when they were deeply philosophical.

    + Corey Dyck proposes returning to Mendelssohn’s more inclusive conception, in which enlightenment, culture, and education are interlinked aspects of human and social development.
        + Mendelssohn distinguishes clearly between enlightenment as a human (universal) and as a citizen (particularized by social role or estate).
        + Human development is viewed as gradual self-cultivation of rational and social faculties, not a sudden break or process exclusive to the scholarly public.
        + Female-led salons in Berlin (Herz, Varnhagen) exemplify institutions that fostered culture and sociability capable of overcoming gender and “estate/class” divisions.
            + These salons promoted equality, liberty, and refinement as antidotes to prevailing prejudices, realizing in practice Mendelssohnian enlightenment.
        + Holst argued that developing one’s faculties is the essential vocation of all humans, including women; she grounded the universal right to education on this foundation.
            + Holst used Mendelssohn’s distinctions to argue that gender is only “accidental/extra-essential” for the essential human vocation, thus supporting full rights to self-cultivation for women.
    + Elise Reimarus exemplifies women’s critical, prudent, and persistent engagement in the debates surrounding prejudice, toleration, and the pace of enlightenment.
        + Women acted as mediators and strategists in the crucial philosophical debates of the age—on freedom, religion, culture, and education—using both strategies of resistance and transformation.
    + Neglecting Mendelssohn and the women philosophers of the late eighteenth century preserves an exclusive and distorted history of the Enlightenment and modern philosophy.
