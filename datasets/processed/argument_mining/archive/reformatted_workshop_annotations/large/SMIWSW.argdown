Main thesis: We should actively work to make brain plasticity a vehicle for the production of new forms of freedom, resisting its reduction to the ideology of flexibility demanded by contemporary capital and building toward “a world to come.”
 + Malabou’s central concern is the paradox of freedom: Why, in a scientific age that recognizes plasticity, openness, and chance in the brain and world, are we still not free?
    + Neuroscience depicts the brain as inherently plastic—capable of development, adaptation, learning, and repair—and popular science celebrates this flexibility.
    + This flexibility, however, is double-edged: it can enable self-transformation, creativity, and new ways of becoming; but it can also reinforce the demand for adaptability by economies and societies, naturalizing precarity, docility, and social conformity.
        + Economic and corporate structures themselves have become “connectionist” networks, mirroring and invoking the flexible brain as their model and justification.
        + The new “ideology of flexibility” is not neutral: it frames unemployment and social suffering as pathological inflexibility, to be “treated” (even pharmacologically), rather than understood as products of structural social failures.
    + The uncritical adoption of connectionist neuroscience thus legitimizes capitalist demands as natural, risking a society where adaptability replaces critical freedom with docile and expendable subjects.
    + Malabou challenges the assumption that the neuronal (biological brain) and the mental (conscious subject) are continuous, asserting that true freedom requires interruption, resistance, and a rethinking of their relation.
        + She theorizes a fourth, intermediate form of plasticity—between the proto-self and conscious subject—where creativity, subjectivation, and resistance can emerge.
        + This space allows for both resistance to mere flexibility and the possibility of genuine individuation, recognition, and liberty.
        + Malabou draws on Hegel (dialectical negativity), Foucault (resistance/subjectivation), and Deleuze (production of difference via brain “images”) to emphasize transformative, not merely adaptive, freedom.
