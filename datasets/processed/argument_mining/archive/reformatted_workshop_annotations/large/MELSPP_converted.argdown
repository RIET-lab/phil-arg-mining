Main Thesis: It is better to approach Spencer's epics from a poetic phenomenological lens than the lens of humanism which has been traditionally used to understand his texts.
 + Poetic phenomenology situates the reader more acutely to the importance of context and interpersonal relations in Spencer's work.
 + This focuses the reader's imagination in the singular reality and social context of Spencer's fictions.
     {isImplicit: true}
 + Poetic phenomenology thus gives us more textual access to Spencer's imagination than traditional humanism which is founded on Plato's idea of universal forms. 
     {isImplicit: true}
 + Platonic transcendentalism is not the only way to access spiritual themes and symbols in Spencer's work. 
     {isImplicit: true}
 + A phenomenological approach gives us greater access to the social dynamics enunciated by Spencer's use of spiritual themes.
