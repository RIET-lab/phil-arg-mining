Contemporary philosophy offers two distinct post-ontotheological strategies for approaching the divine: a post-Heideggerian hermeneutic approach and a materialist approach. 
 + The post-Heideggerian hermeneutic approach articulates the divine not as a supreme being, but as an interdependent dimension of finite, contextual meaningfulness. The hermeneutical god-to-come is conceived as a potential futurity, present only as a hint or trace pointing to an absence. 
 + The materialist approach of Badiou and Meillassoux rejects Heideggerian finitude and uses mathematics as its ontological model. This strategy leads to two different outcomes: contemporary atheism (Badiou) or a contingent divine entity (Meillassoux). 
   + Badiou's contemporary atheism abandons any notion of divinity by understanding being as an inherently meaningless, pure multiplicity. 
   + Meillassoux reintroduces a God-entity as a virtual possibility - one that does not exist but could emerge contingently in the future. This notion of a virtual god, whose coming is unpredictable but possible, provides a basis for a rationally legitimate hope and may signal a new, non-ontotheological rationalism.
