The debate about cinematic motion should be understood in terms of necessary reception conditions.
    + Gregory Currie rejects weak illusionism, arguing that cinematic images really move, but in a response-dependent way.
        + Currie’s rejection of perceptual illusionism is controversial and both illusionists and realists appeal to common intuition about cinematic motion.
        + Andrew Kania claims that Currie does not provide a sufficient argument for realism, only argues against illusionism.
        - The possibility of a third position: that we have an illusion of images moving in front of us (implicit in the debate).
        + Kania argues that cinematic motion is an illusion, since no real objects move onscreen—only a sequence of still images.
        + Trevor Ponech asserts that cinema contains “singletons” that undergo real, stroboscopic movement and these can be experienced as objects by the audience.
            + According to Ponech, the stroboscopic displacement of these singletons constitutes real movement, even if not identical to garden-variety motion.
    + The experience of cinematic motion depends on specific perceptual conditions (e.g., projection at 24 fps, proper lighting).
        + Altering these conditions (e.g., slowing down the projector) means one is no longer experiencing the cinematic artwork as intended.
        + The analogy with music and visual arts supports the idea that proper reception conditions are essential for the intended experience.
        - The perception of movement in cinema is shaped by how the brain interprets sequences of static images.
Currie’s theory is most plausible among the three, recognizing motion in cinema as real (though response-dependent), without fully embracing illusionism.
