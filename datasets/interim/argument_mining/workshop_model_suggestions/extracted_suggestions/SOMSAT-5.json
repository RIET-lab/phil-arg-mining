  "The aim of this essay is to show the purpose for which Deleuze uses Sartre's critique of Husserl against Kant, and to show the interrelation between this critique and the establishment of transcendental empiricism.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "If this is correct, it would mean that The Transcendence of the Ego would implicitly contain the major axioms of the Deleuzian system, particularly the division between actual states of affairs and virtual singularities.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Central to this analysis will be both Sartre and Deleuze's responses to Kant, and in particular to the argument of the transcendental deduction.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "The first three implications of Sartre's critique define the general conditions that Deleuze claims a transcendental empiricism must meet.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "The difficulty is that, as it stands, and regardless of Deleuze's claims for his proof, Deleuze's arguments have only established the possibility of transcendental empiricism.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "The import of this is that Sartre's critique of Kant, whilst providing the grounds for a move away from the concept of a transcendental ego, does not warrant the radical rejection of the structural relations within the transcendental field proposed by Deleuze.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Deleuze believes that these two claims in fact imply one another, so that a rejection of one forces us also to reject the other.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "For Sartre, the difficulty with this argument is that it fails to recognize the possibility of the object itself providing the grounds for the unity of experience": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "The task of a philosophy which does not wish to fall into the traps of consciousness and the cogito is to purge the transcendental field of all resemblance.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
