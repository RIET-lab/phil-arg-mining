  "Uranga's account enables Mexicans to have positive valuation of their being independently of the approving gaze of the colonizers and their standards of value.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "Portilla's thought distinguishes between pernicious accidentality resulting from the disintegration of sense-making frameworks and authentic accidentality as a condition for freedom, self-creation, and ultimately for individual and communal liberation.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "Perhaps surprisingly, Emilio Uranga thinks otherwise.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Uranga argues that being an accident is preferable over being a substance.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "Uranga's main recommendation for accidentality is authenticity.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "As Uranga sees it, then, Pedro's position is a privileged one, for it puts him in more direct contact with the primordial human condition; Pedro's accidentality makes him more authentic because it allows him to be 'in the vicinity of his own being' (An√°lisis 45, II.2.5).": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Uranga proposes to invert this ontological valuation and regard accidentality as preferable to substantiality, and this proposal is self-consciously undertaken for decolonial purposes.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Uranga's explicit goal, in his Nietzschean transvaluation of ontological values, is to reinstate the dignity of Mexicans without giving into the values imposed by the colonizers, to create conceptual space for Mexicans to have a positive valuation of their being without the approving gaze of the colonizers and their standards of value.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "With this we get a first sketch of what it is to have authentic accidentality: it is to live with the full recognition of our radical freedom to construct ourselves, and thus with full recognition of the doubly ungrounded nature of our constructed self.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "For Portilla, authenticity requires the recognition that values can never be incorporated into our being as constituent elements but must remain nothing but the ideal unity guiding our perpetual task of valued self-constitution.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "For Portilla, pernicious accidentality cannot be construed as a decolonial tool, and, in fact, it constitutes an obstacle to liberation and decolonization, for it constitutes an obstacle to human agency more generally.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Authentic accidentality, by contrast, is a condition for authentic freedom and individual liberation, which Portilla understands as essentially embedded within the history of the community's liberation.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Because decolonization is a type of liberation-the liberation from the yoke of the colonial past-Portilla's notion of authentic accidentality is conceptually connected to decolonization, and in fact is a central part of the theoretical roadmap for communities to do away with the oppressive consequences of their colonial past.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
