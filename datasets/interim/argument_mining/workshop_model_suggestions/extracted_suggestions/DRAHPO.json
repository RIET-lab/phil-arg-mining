  "Hegel's philosophy of logic shares Cusanus' philosophical effort for exiting out classical logic.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "He seems to have assumed Cusanus' anticipation of the new theoretical organization; all goes as if Hegel wanted to improve Cusanus' poor method, by introducing a process of additions of two negations which however does not agree with the intuitionist logic.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Moreover, Hegel presupposes, like Cusanus in his last years, the free application of the principle of sufficient reason to the entire subject of his philosophy of logic without awareness of the logical constraints to which is subject a correct application of this principle; hence, he introduced a metaphysical arguing which according to modern mathematical logic has no consistent content.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Hegel seems prolong Cusanus' search on the main more important logical problems of the latter: 1) how to reason out of Aristotelian logic through the use of doubly negated terms (or propositions); 2) how to characterize reason's approaching and even achieving a transcendent world.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "In the literature on the relationship Hegel-Cusanus there exists an agreement on three points: 1) contrarily to a common attitude of past scholars of Nicolas Cusanus (1401-1464), his thinking cannot be interpreted through Hegel's philosophy (Gabriel 1970); Hegel suggested a different theory which is not compatible with Cusanus'; 2) Hegel's writings lack of any quotation of Cusanus' antecedent philosophical work; 3) but his logical thinking is in a great consonance with Cusanus'.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "The main difference of Hegel's logic from the old logic is his claiming to argue through a dialectics which proceeds through the application of a sequence of two negations to a positive term.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "Hegel ignores that in a PO context even the positive term should be considered as belonging to intuitionist logic, i.e. as only a partial truth which is not in opposition to both its negation and its double negation": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "Hegel had no idea of these constraints and therefore freely applies his PSR, which led to transcend in an uncontrolled way the reality of the basic term": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
