  "Gregory Currie produced the first comprehensive philosophy of film in the analytic tradition with Image and Mind in 1995, and identified the essence of film as 'moving pictures' (Currie, 1997, p. 47).": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "His ontology of film is strictly realist, and he rejects both cognitive and perceptual illusionism in film.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Currie's rejection of this claim is highly controversial, with both illusionists and realists appealing to an intuitive view of cinematic motion.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Kania agrees with Currie that there is no illusion of physical objects in motion onscreen, but rejects his alternative of a veridical experience of images in motion.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Ponech identifies the essence of the debate as being 'whether the image undergoes objective displacement, that is, moves continuously in a contiguous space, independent of any perceptual uptake' (Ponech, 2006, p. 354).": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Singletons are real perceptual objects and their continuous stroboscopic displacement is real movement.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Kania's argument against Currie relies upon a single contention, the connection between the succession of still images that constitute the medium of film, and the perception of the moving images on the screen.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Projection at 24 fps is therefore a necessary condition for the reception of the art form of film by an audience.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "The experience of film is the experience of seeing moving images under specific perceptual circumstances (e.g., 24 fps on a white screen in a dark room), which are necessary for the experience.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "If one is considering perception in general, or any particular aspect thereof, the default setting is that humans with fully functioning senses perceive reality rather than illusion.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Currie's theory of cinematic motion is the most plausible of the three options.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "The view that the illusory nature of film can be proved by slowing the projector down is thus doubly fallacious: because there are-or could be-other methods of producing the work, and because once the conditions for aesthetic experience and perception are changed, one can no longer be said to experience the work of art.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "cinematic motion is the real movement of singletons. This movement is apparent (i.e., response dependent), but it is not illusory (i.e., deceptive).": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
