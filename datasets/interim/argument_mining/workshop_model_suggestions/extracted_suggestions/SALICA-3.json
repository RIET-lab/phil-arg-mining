  "It is the aim of this work to study the assumptions and conditions for the original position of sameness in experience, just as it occurs in the synthesis of the datum singular and distinct.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "A singular is not, phenomenologically, an atom of self-identity.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "The same only succeeds in the succession of its differences.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Continuity is defined, in opposition to what continues, by its noncontinuation.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "The original synthesis of sameness does not require the accumulation of diversities: it cannot be defined as the result of a process in time.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Phenomena appear as distinct: different from all else and internally undistinct (or self-identical).": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "The sameness of an immanent datum becomes a phenomenological problem relevant to the analysis of the experience of the identical when the following assumptions, at least, are considered": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "The immanent unity of identity that appears in a singular datum cannot be conceived in the manner of a phenomenal atom of meaning whose synthetic groupings might constitute the object's identity. A singular is not, phenomenologically, an atom of self-identity.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "Continuity is defined, in opposition to what continues, by its noncontinuation. Continuity itself does not have an identity, for it does not have modifications. It does not succeed.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "The concrete immanent unity always supposed (even in the abstract consideration of the point-system) can not be finitely itself: that is to say, it does not occupy a determinate contour in logical space.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
