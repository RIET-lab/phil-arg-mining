  "The aim of this chapter is to do this for a central topic in his metaphysics: his ontology of accidents.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Are accidents beings in their own right, so that an inventory of what there is would include substances as well as various kinds of accidents? Or can accidents in some way be reduced to substances and their material parts?": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "To regiment this ontology, he proposed that at least some accidents could be reduced to substances and their material parts.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "But even though White aimed for a generally lean ontology of accidents, he did not believe that all accidents could be so reduced.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Given a correct account of location, however, this plurality of worlds hypothesis can be ruled out.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "White proposes a return to Aristotle: the location of an object is the inner surface limit of the body that contains it.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Given such bodies and given minds to abstract away from motion, then, there is no need to add locations as separate items to an inventory of what there is.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Even though accidents never come without substances to bear them, and even though some accidents appear to reduce to substances, White believes that at least some accidents are distinct from their bearers.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "The philosophy of Thomas White can be characterized as a systematic attempt to combine Aristotelian thought with the best of the new science of the early modern period.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "At the same time, however, he does not think that all accidents can be accounted for in this way.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20"
