  "I argue, contrary to much of the literature, that Ockham believes that if one were given this command, one would be obligated to refrain from loving God and would also be able to fulfill this obligation without any moral wrongdoing.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Among other results, this study will help clarify Ockham's much-discussed claim that loving God is 'a necessarily virtuous act.'": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "I intend to show in the remainder of this paper that in Quodlibet III.14 Ockham affirms the following five claims:": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "No act is necessary, and consequently no act is necessarily virtuous. Also, because every act can be brought about by God alone, and consequently such an act is not necessarily virtuous because an act of this sort [namely, one brought about by God alone] is not within the will's power.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "an act can be understood to be necessarily virtuous in another sense, namely, that the act could not be vicious given the established divine command. Similarly, that the act cannot be caused by a created will without being virtuous.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "an act that is necessarily virtuous in the aforementioned sense is an act of the will, for an act by which God is loved above all things and for his own sake is such an act, for this act is virtuous in such a way that it cannot be vicious, nor can this act be caused by a created will without being virtuous.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "God can command that he not be loved for some time, since he can command an intellect (and likewise a will) to be so intent on studying that it could in no way think about God for that time.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "if God could command this - as it seems that he can without contradiction - then I say that the will cannot elicit this sort of act at that time.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "However, the will could love God with a simple and natural affection, which is not the love of God above all things.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
