  "According to him, the Body of Christ is truly present in the sacramental species; he thinks that the Body of Christ is also present in the stomach of the disciple when he receives the Eucharist, and even in the stomach of someone who receives it unworthily; indeed, in general, the Body of Christ in its integrity is present wherever one can see the consecrated species of bread and wine.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
