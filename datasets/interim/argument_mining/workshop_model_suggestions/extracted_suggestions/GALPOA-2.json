  "This paper proposes an application of Enrique DusselÕs ethics of liberation to an issue of crucial importance to US minorities: the debate on affirmative action.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "I show how the basic principles of DusselÕs ethical theory (which are best expounded in his book Ethics of Liberation) allow us to address what I take to be the main demands of both advocates and critics of affirmative action in a satisfactory way.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Although the initial goals of affirmative action in higher education Ði.e., achieving equality and promoting diversityÐ are good and praiseworthy, affirmative action is flawed because it is a reformist policy that leaves intact the structural conditions that generate discrimination and oppression.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Considering this, I contend that applying DusselÕs ethics of liberation to the issue of affirmative action regarding the access to higher education provides us with a way to reconcile what I take to be the crucial demands of both critics and advocates of affirmative action.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Two of the greatest philosophical contributions of Enrique Dussel have been his rejection of a conception of ethics often accepted by the major figures of the Western philosophical tradition as an abstract discipline that has no cultural roots and the central claims of which are deemed to have a universal validity in virtue of its independence from historical contingencies, and his attempt to articulate and defend an alternate conception of ethics as a human activity that, throughout its history, has been shaped by the political and economic interests of those who create it.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
