  "The aim of this article is to draw interest to a period, or rather a certain philosophical culture, which has been neglected so far by standard historians of philosophy.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Until recently Francisco Suárez (1548-1617) has been regarded as representing the climax of these scholastic discussions.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",

  "At the moment it is premature to attempt such an outline.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Finally, although in my opinion Baroque philosophical culture is valuable not just for historians but also from the systematic point of view, this claim will not be substantiated in an article such as this, which deals primarily with historical considerations.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "In the seventeenth century, an 'alternative' philosophical culture runs parallel to the well-known culture of so-called 'modern philosophy,' which is usually 'presented as a contest between two philosophies - Cartesian rationalism and British empiricism.'": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Some of these labels, such as 'late medieval,' 'Renaissance,' 'early modern Aristotelianism/scholasticism,' are inaccurate, whereas others, such as 'Second scholastic,' 'Counter-Reformation philosophy,' might carry unwelcome connotations.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20"
