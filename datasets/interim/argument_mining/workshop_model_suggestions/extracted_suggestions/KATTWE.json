  "Katzav and Vaesen have argued that control by analytic philosophers of key journals, philosophy departments and at least one funding body plays a substantial role in explaining the emergence of analytic philosophy into dominance in the Anglophone world and the corresponding decline of speculative philosophy.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "They also argued that this use of control suggests a characterisation of analytic philosophy as, at the institutional level, a sectarian form of critical philosophy.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "I argue, further, that Katzav and Vaesen's hypotheses can fully explain the data and are more fully able to do so than some other key accounts of the emergence of analytic philosophy in the USA.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "In accordance with (1), the data examined here indicate that there was a sharp increase in the ratio of hires of analytic philosophers to non-analytic philosophers by influential departments from about 1950.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "In accordance with (2), this ratio continued to increase during the 1950s and 1960s.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "In accordance with (3), the data suggest that influential departments start more or less exclusively to hire analytic philosophers in the 1950s and 1960s.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Finally, in accordance with (4), many students completing PhDs in the 1950s were still working outside of what was then analytic philosophy.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "In summary, Strassfeld's data and my revision of this data are fully explained by the hypothesis that analytic philosophy gained substantial ground from about 1950 and did so as a result of institutional control.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "By the middle of the 1950s, analytic philosophy was bound to come out on top, at least when it comes to the most influential American departments.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
