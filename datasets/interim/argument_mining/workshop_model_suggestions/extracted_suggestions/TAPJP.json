  "Joseph Priestley's range of intellectual interests was very great, even by the standards of the eighteenth century.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "He argued the case for materialism perhaps more cogently than did any British thinker before recent times.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "He presented determinism vigorously, with a focus on the central issue of the nature of causation.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "He defended scientific realism against Thomas Reid's Common Sense realism and against (as he saw it) David Hume's phenomenonalism.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "He articulated, against Hume, a working scientist's account of causation, induction and scientific progress.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "He defended the Argument from Design against Hume's penetrating criticisms.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "His attempt to combine theism, materialism and determinism is audacious and original.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "He tried to show that such a system does not lapse into pantheism.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "As a political thinker, he distinguished usefully between civil and political liberty, and argued the case for extensive civil liberties.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "His liberalism is closely bound up with his account of historical progress.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "He was perhaps the most thorough British exponent of a Providentialist account of progress.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "His ultimate aim was to combine Enlightenment principles with a modernized Christian theism.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Priestley's materialism rests on three main arguments, each of which bears interesting scientific connections.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Priestley's determinism can be more briefly described, as it rests on one main argument, forcefully expounded in his Doctrine of Philosophical Necessity of 1777.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Priestley's general position, then, is that naturalism fails to make sense of biology.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Since both these moves fail, we are forced to postulate an intelligent Creator, following the analogy of human creativity.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Priestley's life was one of perpetual disputation.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "He always regarded controversy as a service to truth, and it was his custom to answer every objection his critics could propose.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",

  "Nature, in Priestley's view, is a multi-leveled set of systems, in which different powers belong to different levels of organization. Simplicity does not reduce everything to physics.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "Priestley's general position, then, is that naturalism fails to make sense of biology. If we follow Hume we must ascribe to life itself powers which belong only to the level of life's components. If we follow Erasmus Darwin we must invent a mechanically impossible entity to bridge the gulf between the non-living and the living. Since both these moves fail, we are forced to postulate an intelligent Creator, following the analogy of human creativity.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
