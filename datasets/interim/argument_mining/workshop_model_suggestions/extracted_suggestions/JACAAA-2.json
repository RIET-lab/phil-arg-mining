  "Aristotle's own theory of time is designed to avoid just these paradoxes.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Time does not exist in its own right. It is, rather, an aspect of substances and their changes: the substratum of time is the numerable aspect of the before and after of substances undergoing change (or in the case of substantial change, of whatever underlies the change).": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
