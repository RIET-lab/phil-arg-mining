  "The personal dimension of human life is constituted through the 'relation' and not through 'distance'.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "The first movement yields the answer to the question: 'How is man possible?' The second answers the question: 'How is human life realized?'": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "The mutual confirmation of human beings in their uniqueness distinguishes man from other living beings.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "The confirmation itself then represents the realization of the second movement of the 'relation'.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "The connection between 'entering into a relation' and the basic word I-Thou is obvious.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "The connection between 'primal distance' and the I-It relation is not so obvious.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "In the concept of 'primal distance', that is the ontological presupposition of all human relationships to all existing beings, Buber recognized the anthropological foundation of his cosmic vision of dialogical life.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "The central question is 'How is man possible?' Buber's answer is very important to the further development of his principle of dialogue in psychology (primarily his notion of confirmation) and philosophy of art, but it is not quite clear how compatible it is with some of his earlier theses from I and Thou.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "The principle of human life is twofold and is based on two movements. He calls the first of these two movements 'the primal setting at a distance' (Urdistanzierung) and the second of them 'entering into a relation' (In-Beziehung-Treten)": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "one can enter into relation only with a being which has been set at a distance": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "While the second movement, as we have seen, is not possible without the first, the first is possible without the second. This is down to the transition from the first to the second being not inevitable but possible; the first movement only allows room for the existence of the second.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "Man is the sole living creature in whom the category of possibility is embodied-he is not fully determined and fixed in his being-and therefore needs confirmation": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "The connection between 'entering into a relation' and the basic word I-Thou is obvious. The first means entering into the I-Thou relationship. The 'relation' from the essay 'Distance and Relation' can be fully identified with the I-Thou relationship from I and Thou.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "'Primal distance' is inherent to every man as a man; it is a particular state that establishes the human situation and as such is pre-personal. However, the relations of I-Thou and I-It express the personal existence of man": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
