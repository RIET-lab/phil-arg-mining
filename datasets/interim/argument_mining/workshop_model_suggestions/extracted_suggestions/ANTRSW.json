  "The aim of this contribution is to study certain tensions and developments in this movement, focusing on two questions that were formulated by the philosopher Francisque Bouillier.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "First: Is it possible to overcome the overly narrow Cartesian conception of the soul by appealing to the dynamic ontology of Leibnizian monads?": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Second: Might the reference to Leibniz help to consolidate rational spiritualism, protecting it from materialist attacks, without however falling into the excesses of those physicians in the medical faculties who adhered to strong forms of animism or vitalism?": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "The analyses will mainly show how Bouillier opened up a new path for spiritualism which, by proposing new readings of Descartes and Leibniz and stressing the notion of an 'inner sense of life,' allowed for an authentic dialogue with the life sciences.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "For Bouillier, reviving the 'spirit' of Cartesianism involved careful work on the central figures of the Cartesian philosophy but wholly contextualized within institutionalized Cousinian spiritualism.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "Bouillier reproached Descartes for thinking man as a soul distinct from a body with which no real, effective synergy is possible.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "What is lacking in both occasionalism-including Cartesian occasionalism-and pre-established harmony is a veritable notion of activity.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Bouillier's objective in the second revised version of the book on the vital principle was thus to show the way in which animism, while promoting a doctrine that unified the soul and the vital principle, allowed him to respond to the organicists, both spiritualist and non-spiritualist, better than the followers of Biran could do.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Bouillier thus literally turned Cousin's project on its head: The interest of Cousin's Descartes became the contrary of what it was for Cousin.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Bouillier overturned the Cartesian model, but this time the dominant one.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "It is a Descartes conceived via a new interpretation of Leibnizianism, saved from the official Cousinianism caricatural conception of its relation to 'animism' and 'Cartesianism.'": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Nineteenth-century French 'spiritualism' is a paradigmatic case of a philosophical movement that is construed and mediated through the reception of early modern authors": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "The Cousinian movement was thus, somewhat paradoxically, threatened exactly because it was so powerful.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "This problem expands into a general underestimation of created substances that puts Descartes on the slippery slope towards the phenomenalization of the soul's thoughts.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "By correcting the fundamental error of Cartesianism, he also finds the remedy for Spinozism. Here we finally have real and persistent substances that are as different from the phenomena as they are from the infinite substance itself, and not just ghostly substances without consistence or action that are absorbed into the true cause and the unique true substance.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
