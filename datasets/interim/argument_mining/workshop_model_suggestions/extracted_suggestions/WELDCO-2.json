  "Du Châtelet has a worked-out defense of the explanatory and epistemic need for mathematical objects, consistent with their metaphysical non-fundamentality.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",

  "Propositions referring to imaginary mathematical objects can thus yield a true theory (if not the full details of its application to actual phenomena).": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "This example shows that, for Du Châtelet, abstract representations that do not truly represent empirical reality can still play a role in correct reasoning.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Breaking with Wolff, Du Châtelet argues that the objects of metaphysics can be conceived only by the understanding, and not the imagination.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "I have argued that despite her broadly Wolffian metaphysics, Du Châtelet is far more optimistic than Wolff about the explanatory and epistemic status of mathematics, and that this position is linked to core features of her metaphysics and epistemology.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "There is a tension in Emilie Du Châtelet's thought on mathematics. The objects of mathematics are ideal or fictional entities; nevertheless, mathematics is presented as indispensable for an account of the physical world.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "Like Christian Wolff, she regards space, time, and mathematical objects as ideal entities-as products, in part, of the imagination. While Wolff concludes that mathematics is not a good guide to how the world really is, Du Châtelet defends the indispensability of mathematics for an account of the physical world.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "With no resort to it, one would hope in vain to make great progress in the study of nature. It is the key to all discoveries; and if there are still several inexplicable things in physics, that is because geometry has been insufficiently used to explain them, and one has perhaps not yet gone far enough in this science.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
