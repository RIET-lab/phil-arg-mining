  "The Radical Enlightenment, Israel argues, was characterized philosophically by materialism, monism and determinism; religiously by secularism and universalism and politically by its commitment to democracy and revolutionary reform of political institutions.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "The Moderate Enlightenment, on the other hand, was characterized by its commitment to dualism, deism, constitutional monarchism, and a morality based on sentiment and tradition rather than the Radical insistence on reason.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "According to Israel, figures in the Moderate Enlightenment eschewed revolution and instead believed progress to be based on Providence.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Israel argues that the revolutionary events of the 18th Century were preceded by revolutionary ideas of 'la nouvelle philosophie', which he identifies with the Radical Enlightenment.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "In particular, revolutionary events in America, France and the Netherlands were preceded, Israel argues, by the ideas of equality, democracy, and reason as the basis of a universal morality, proposed by the most radical of the Enlightenment thinkers.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Jonathan Israel is an academic on a mission.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "His aim is to reconceive the Enlightenment as a pan-European, transatlantic phenomenon with two distinct, incompatible strains: a Radical Enlightenment and a Moderate Enlightenment.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Israel gives us not only an interesting new take on the historiography of the Enlightenment, but also does important philosophical work.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "He reveals what radicals in the 17th century knew - dualism and free will do not save genuine freedom; they deny its conditions of possibility.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "One cannot have genuine freedom, argued Spinoza, without understanding the causal conditions of our existence as material beings.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "To improve our lives and the lives of our neighbors, we need to understand ourselves as part of Nature, as part of the causal structure of the universe.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Although he focuses his attention on the 18th century, Israel recognizes the foundations of the Radical Enlightenment in the 17th century.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "He identifies the political and moral kernel of the Radical Enlightenment in Spinoza's metaphysics and political writings.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "According to Spinoza and his Radical Enlightenment followers, democracy is the freest and most absolute state and therefore the best form of state.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "However, we cannot count on human nature or Providence alone to achieve this political freedom.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Action is required in order to achieve enlightenment.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Beloved Enlightenment figures, such as Kant, Rousseau and Locke, are lambasted and replaced with new heroes: d'Holbach, Schimmelpenninck, Price and Helv√©tius.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Although Kant, Rousseau and Locke are often forgiven their peccadilloes on race, imperialism and gender, their views on rights, freedom, the scope of reason and Enlightenment are taken as 'radical for their time'; however, Israel exposes their views as comparatively conservative, and moderate given the radical ideas on offer.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Israel occasionally errs on the side of grand pronouncement over specific argumentation.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "For example, his major thesis, that there are two Enlightenments: Radical and Moderate, is well supported.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Israel shows us a variety of ways in which the elements of the two Enlightenments can be differentiated.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "However, his further claim that these two are incompatible philosophically is a claim that merits more detailed argumentation.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "That is, to say two philosophical views are different is one thing; to say that they are incompatible because of those differences, is quite another.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Israel's arguments for difference succeed, but he does not meet the burden of proof for incompatibility.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Methodologically, Israel practices what he calls the 'controversialist method in the history of ideas.'": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "This method is characterized by interpreting the ideas of individual philosophers in the context of the debates of their own time, by which they are influenced and to which their work contributes.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Israel shows us that by failing to understand the context and controversies in the history of ideas, we fail to understand the contextual nature of philosophy itself.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "In doing so, we deliberately misinterpret philosophers the past and ignore the contextual nature of our own work.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "However, we cannot count on human nature or Providence alone to achieve this political freedom. Action is required in order to achieve enlightenment.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "his further claim that these two are incompatible philosophically is a claim that merits more detailed argumentation.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
