  "The goal of this paper is to clarify such claims and draw conceptual distinctions separating the depressive states that are pathological from those that are normal and normative responses to misfortune.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "Without such anchoring, and in light of the findings and assumptions of today's biological diagnostic psychiatry, we must re-visit each of them.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "The tendency to collapse distinctions such as that between normal suffering and depressive disorder comes at a cost in the richness of our experience and understanding.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Collapsing these distinctions seems all too likely to forestall social and political action not only more fitting but, in directing itself toward the causes of much of this suffering, more effective.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "Because it no longer adheres to humoral or other causal analyses and is instead solely 'descriptive' in its account of symptoms, contemporary diagnostic psychiatry appears without a way to secure the conceptual distinction between these different kinds of depression.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "The task is to justify and account for the presumption that states of pathological depression are importantly distinct from normal responses to life's vicissitudes, and to explain why the disease or illness status of depression is not arbitrarily assigned.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Dissatisfied with accounts of disease as (harmful) dysfunction, whether defined statistically or by appeal to evolutionary psychology, Rachel Cooper has proposed a different approach, and I want to devote some attention to this alternative.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "This definition seems a promising one and, in light of the now well-rehearsed problems associated with both Boorsian and Wakefield accounts, deserves a closer look.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Until such time as fully causal accounts of pathological depression allow us to separate those from depressive states that are more normal and normative, we must look toward philosophical definitions that attempt to circumscribe those states that reflect pathology, of which Cooper's is one of the most helpful.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Data indicate the ubiquity and rapid increase of depression wherever war, want and social upheaval are found.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "Without anchoring humoral theory, then, we face a conceptual problem: depressive states of despair, discouragement, numbness, dispiritedness, sadness, demoralization, anxiety and grief result not only from biological and inter psychic causes, but from the vicissitudes of life.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "Preserving the conceptual space around depression understood as a real disorder rather than a more normal response-whether to oppressive conditions or to life's vicissitudes-is a goal with practical, as well as theoretical, interest and implications.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
