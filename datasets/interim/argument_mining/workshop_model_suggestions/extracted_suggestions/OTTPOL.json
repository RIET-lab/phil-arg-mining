  "How language works - its functions, mechanisms, and limitations - matters to the early moderns as much as it does to contemporary philosophers. Many of the moderns make reflection on language central to their philosophical projects, both as a tool for explaining human cognition, and as a weapon to be used against competing views.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "In the early modern period, reflection on language is undertaken not so much as a worthy endeavor in its own right but as a means of diagnosing the errors of one's competitors. What spurs most of these figures is not disinterested curiosity but a need to wrest control of the intellectual climate from the schools.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "Nearly all parties to the debate accept that words are signs imposed purely arbitrarily.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "Because speech requires that we be able to use sounds as signs of our internal conceptions, it also requires that the speaker intend to use signs in a certain way. An intention to reveal one's thoughts, then, is at least a prerequisite for accomplishing the core purpose of language.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
