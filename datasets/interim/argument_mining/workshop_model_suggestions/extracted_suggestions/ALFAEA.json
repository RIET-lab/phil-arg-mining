  "First, Nietzsche was a perfectionist. By this I mean that he thought that the only intrinsic good is the realization of human nature.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Second, Nietzsche believed that people have character traits, and that part of what it takes to realize human nature is to develop and act from particular character traits.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "For Nietzsche – and in reality – types are not immutable or fixed.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Although not everyone is endowed with the same type, which type someone belongs to can (though needn’t) evolve over the course of her lifetime.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "In addition, for Nietzsche – and in reality – types on their own are not normative.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Character, which is normatively evaluable, only arises through the refinement, calibration, and development of temperament.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "The main point I want to argue is that Nietzsche held a person-type-relative unity of virtue thesis, according to which what’s intrinsically good for a particular person is to develop and act from particular character traits that “fit” her type.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Typically, a single virtue will best fit a given type. Whatever virtue that is, is the type’s cardinal virtue.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Any other virtues that the person with that type “ought” in some sense to develop are determined by the extent to which they support or enable the type’s cardinal virtue and the extent to which they fail to hinder or undermine it.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Moreover, I will argue that, for Nietzsche, part of what it can mean for a person to be of a certain type is that she is susceptible to social determination of her character.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "The maximum value of a life, as it were, is determined by one’s type, but whether one attains that maximum is a contingent matter.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "A person of a “higher” type who fails to live up to her nature (to acquire and act from the virtues characteristic of her type) is no better (and probably worse, because she is such a disappointment) than a person of a lower type who successfully lives up to his nature.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "The Doctrine of Types and the Doctrine of the Hierarchy of Types are distinct theses, though the latter presupposes the former.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "In addition, for Nietzsche – and in reality – types on their own are not normative. Character, which is normatively evaluable, only arises through the refinement, calibration, and development of temperament.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
