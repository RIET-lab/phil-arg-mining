  "The authors repeatedly - and wrongly - claim that there is a tradition of Stoic logic (and Stoic logical terminology) transmitted continuously from antiquity to the 19th century that was generally known in the 18th and 19th centuries.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "In this second part of the refutation it is shown that the authors are mistaken on these points, and why.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "(ii) Stoic logic was part of the traditional view;": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "However, as this second part of the Refutation will show, (ii) is false, and because of this the authors' argument fails regardless.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "So given this complete absence of Stoic logic proper in Pre-Prantlian logic textbooks in 19th century Germany (and beyond), the authors' point (a) above collapses, as does the authors' inference that 'in Frege's time various pieces of Stoic logical thinking were, so to speak, 'in the air'' (p.437, fn. 9, my emphasis).": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "The authors repeatedly refer to this hypothesis that in the 18th and 19th centuries many philosophers and logicians made use of ideas of Stoic logic proper without knowing that they are Stoic.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "What all these claims have in common is that, in their article, the authors do not offer a single concrete piece of evidence or illustration, of what they have in mind.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "So the authors' claim (b) is simply incorrect.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "So although propositional logic may have been floating somewhere in the German air at Frege's time, there was nothing floating that was even remotely as close to Frege's late work in philosophical logic and philosophy of language than what he found in Prantl's chapter, including the copious footnotes.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
