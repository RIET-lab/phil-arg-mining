  "And, at this point, Edwards concludes that there are no created substances at all, only God.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Edwards's monism is part of a simple and beautiful system. His fundamental ontology can be summed up by six, mainly negative, principles": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",

  "One line of argument uses no action at a distance as its main premise, and infers continual creation and no enduring things from it. This line of argument supports no created substance and no created powers without quite implying them, for no action at a distance and no enduring things leave open the possibility of momentary substances that are immanent causes of their own states.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "Here I'll consider the second line of argument. It starts with the notion that properties must be upheld by something and asks what's doing the upholding, ultimately concluding that only God - and not matter - can uphold the properties of bodies.
