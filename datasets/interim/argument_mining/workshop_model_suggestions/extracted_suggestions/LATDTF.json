  "We found no evidence that the folk representation of time is sensitive, or that the folk representation of time is essentially dynamical in either sense, though we did find evidence of a largely (though not universally) shared representation, on which dynamical features are sufficient, but not necessary, for time.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "The claim that dynamism gets something right about the folk representation of time requires unpacking.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Extant research, however, has not targeted the key question with which this paper concerns itself: namely, whether the folk representation of time is a representation of something essentially dynamical.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Hence they concluded that there is reason to suppose that there are at least two folk representations of actual time amongst the population they tested: one dynamical and one non-dynamical.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Matters are, however, slightly more complex than this.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "We can now disambiguate the claim that the folk representation of time is a representation of something essentially dynamical.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "In all, we found evidence against the shared representation thesis and in favour of the multi-representation thesis.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Our results suggest that most—but not all—participants have a directionally-sufficient representation.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Our results show that arguments for temporal dynamism that proceed via a claim about the folk, or ordinary, view of time, must be carefully evaluated.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "These results suggest that the folk do not represent time as essentially dynamical.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "Arguments that intend to show that dynamism is necessarily true because non-dynamism is conceptually impossible—because a non-dynamical world would not satisfy our representation of time—are not consistent with our results.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
