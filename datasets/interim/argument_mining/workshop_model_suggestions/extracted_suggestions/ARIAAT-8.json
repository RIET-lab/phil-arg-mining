  "The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) in the realm of art has sparked numerous philosophical questions related to the authorship and artistic intent behind AI-generated works.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "It suggests that the aesthetic value attributed to an artwork might be seen as independent of its human origin.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "The point here is how AI's emergence reshapes the way the public and users perceive authorship.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "The critical question is not about the presence of real authorial intent in AI-generated works, but rather how these technological developments might transform our understanding of authorship from the perspectives of readers, listeners, and viewers.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "The image of the unique and individual artist and author has, over the years, been largely discredited by these theoretical provocations.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Contemporary AI-generated content introduces a novel form of autonomy with its own control and decision-making capabilities: human authoriality seems replaced by another form of authorship that somewhat mimics the human one.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Agency and intentionality attribution seem important in certain forms of cultural production, but not necessarily in others.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "AI might thus find its niche in art forms where the 'surface' aspect is paramount and the presence of an author is not crucial for our enjoyment.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "This second threshold focuses on whether AI is simply a tool used by human artists or if it can be considered an artist in its own right.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "The human-centric view sees the human author as the source of all creation and AI as just a sophisticated tool.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "An alternative interpretation considers the authorship of AI-generated works as the result of a blending of sources, texts, and works on which the systems have been trained.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Implied authoriality becomes an actively imagined authoriality.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "AI-generated works compel us to abandon any inferences about authorial intention.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "The impact of AI on our perception of authorship is not just a speculative exercise; it is a tangible shift that is already unfolding.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Consider this scenario: you discover that an artwork you greatly admire, or a captivating novel that deeply moved you, is in fact the product of artificial intelligence, not a human's work. Would your aesthetic judgment shift? Would you perceive the work differently?": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "Some argue that AI-systems are simply tools used by human artists - and that are always humans setting in motion those tools -, and that the final product is still a result of human intentionality and creative input. Others claim that AI-generated art represents a new form of artistic expression, in which the AI itself becomes the artist and human involvement is minimal.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "We might have artificial works that are more aesthetically appreciated yet are not deemed as valuable compared to their human equivalents.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "agency and intentionality attribution seem important in certain forms of cultural production, but not necessarily in others": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "AI might thus find its niche in art forms where the 'surface' aspect is paramount and the presence of an author is not crucial for our enjoyment. This includes areas like background music, decorative patterns, industrial design, and formulaic narrative texts, among others.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "in systems like GPT, attributing authorship based solely on the initial prompts is no longer straightforward, as the resulting text appears to emerge from processes that suggest the presence of a distinct reasoning entity.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "it's not from the characteristics of the work (its originality, creativity, etc.) that we derive the presence of authorship. Rather, it's the other way round: it's from the attribution of intentionality and authorship that we perceive that authorship in the work.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
