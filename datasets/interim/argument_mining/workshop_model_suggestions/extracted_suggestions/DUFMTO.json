  "Maimon ' s critique of Kant concerns the central thesis of the /uniFB01 rst Critique that purports to resolve the problem of the relation between pure concepts of the understanding and empirical intuitions by means of the schematism.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "The question quid juris for Maimon is a query concerning the objective use of the concept, i.e. whether this use is legitimate, and if it is, what exactly is the nature of this legitimacy (Maimon, 2010: p. 51)?": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Maimon maintains that as long as sensibility is regarded as an independent source of cognition to the understanding, the possibility of applying concepts to sensible intuition cannot be comprehended.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Maimon ' s starting point is to distinguish between two types of a priori cognition, that which is pure and a priori, and that which is merely a priori (Maimon, 2010: p. 56).": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Maimon considers it to be ' an error to believe that things (real objects) must be prior to their relations ' (Maimon, 2010: p. 190).": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Maimon ' s difference in understanding of arithmetic is deployed in relation to Kant ' s account of synthetic a priori judgments in the /uniFB01 rst Critique.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "For Maimon, the question regarding the connection between the categories of the understanding and the forms of sensibility is generalized into a demand to understand the connection between mere a priori cognition, which draws on intuition, and pure a priori cognition which doesn ' t.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Maimon acknowledges that there is a synthesis between the two components of the proposition.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Maimon ' s solution to the quid juris question, which involves the claim that intuitions are images of concepts, supplants the role proposed by Kant for the thing in itself as what produces the affections of sensibility, because, unlike Kant, Maimonic intuition has a ground which is not extra-cognitive (see Maimon, 2010: p. 30).": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Unlike Kant, who treats sensibility and understanding as two different faculties, for Maimon ' sensibility is incomplete understanding ' (Maimon 2004: p. 183).": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Maimon ' s theory of the differential has proved to be a rather enigmatic aspect of his system.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "The differential itself as a mathematical concept is an idea of the understanding because as a magnitude less than any given magnitude it is not a concept to which an object corresponds.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Maimon ' s explanation of the intuitive in /uniFB01 nitely small as able to be thought of as an object is characteristic of his account of the metaphysically in /uniFB01 nitely small as real.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "The hypothesis that Maimon adopts in order to render the connection between pure a priori concepts and their intuitions comprehensible is that both are modi /uniFB01 cations of the same cognitive faculty.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Maimon ' s idealism therefore accounts for representation without recourse to the thing in itself.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Maimon maintains that as long as sensibility is regarded as an independent source of cognition to the understanding, the possibility of applying concepts to sensible intuition cannot be comprehended. The connection between the two can only be explained by demonstrating that they both derive from the same cognitive source.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",

  "Maimon considers it to be 'an error to believe that things (real objects) must be prior to their relations'": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "These differentials of objects are the so-called noumena; but the objects themselves arising from them are the phenomena. With respect to intuition = 0, the differential of any such object in itself is dx = 0, dy = 0 etc.; however their relations are not = 0, but can rather be given determinately in the intuitions arising from them.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
