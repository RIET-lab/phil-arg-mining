  "I propose in this text a rhythmic theory of signs drawn from the thought of Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "I suggest that the theory of rhythm developed in A Thousand Plateaus (1980) can be understood, in part, as the culmination of the diverse set of inquiries into signs that both Deleuze and Guattari undertook, individually and together, beginning in the 1960s.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "I hope to evoke something of the character of the complex assemblage that is «Deleuze-Guattari», while suggesting that their theory of rhythm could provide a distinctive, heterodox contribution to semiotics.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Deleuze puts forward a conception of signs where the interpreter and their world are co-implicated.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "To inhabit is to refuse any supremacy of the subject or Idea, to posit nature as the site of a vast and diverse set of processes of experimentation, to encounter and to express, to be implicated in the transitory, partial organisation of intensive signs: to take part in a semiorhythmology.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "I propose in this text a rhythmic theory of signs drawn from the thought of Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari. I name this theory a semiorhythmology.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "Learning is not imitation but rather practical engagement, and teachers are not those who say «do as I do» but rather those who say «do with me».": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "To learn is «to constitute this space of an encounter with signs»; in other words, to open ourselves to a disorienting, alien outside, to immerse ourselves in a problem (such as the swimmer with the problem of the sea), to place the relations that constitute our bodies into relation with the relations that constitute the problem, and to give consistency to the new field this then constitutes.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "The diagram allows this notion of rhythm to be detached from its phenomenological origin, and the movement of rhythm is no longer in the dynamic constitution of subject and world, but a movement only between milieus in permanent relation to chaos.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
