  "This paper considers three general dilemmas that tend to undermine successful configurations of unity: the either/or dilemma, the synthesis dilemma and the relativism dilemma.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "It further argues that, in his aesthetic writings, Schiller's critique of Kantian dualisms leads him to an adualistic conception of unity that operates with a different, more inclusive approach to opposition and unification.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Schiller himself prefers an adualistic logic, where both opposed poles remain separate and yet united.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "Schiller's texts instruct us that what is required for 'a firm basis' might be the realization that, in order to be together, it is necessary to remain separate; in order to become one, it is necessary to remain different.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Schiller's oscillating approach strives to ensure both contact and separation.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "Contrary to Leitgeb's interpretation, in the aesthetic state nobody is 'in possession of the truth'. Rather, the aesthetic state breaks with our common practice of thinking in our 'natural', either/or logic of alternatives and therefore does not constitute a totalitarian overcoming. It allows the opposed Other to exist, without the false promise of a Hegelian dialectic of reconciliation within the concept.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
