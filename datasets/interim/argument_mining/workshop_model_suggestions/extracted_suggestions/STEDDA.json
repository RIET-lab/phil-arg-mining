  "The central thesis of the book is the ontological one that artworks are not physical objects on walls and filling spaces in museums, not sound structures indicated by composers and performed in concert halls, not linguistic structures 'uttered' by writers, but the actual 'performances' of artists that create such objects.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "The correlative thesis concerning appreciation is that it requires that we relate the objects just mentioned (which are called the 'work-focus') with the performances that specify them.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "Davies thinks that the most plausible way to account for this fact is to give up the idea that artworks are the products of the artist's creative activity and accept that they are instead the activity that brings about the product.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "The conclusion is that only an ontology that identifies works with said performance will capture these constitutive properties correctly.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Davies's arguments fail to raise serious problems for the contextualist or convince us to accept the performance view.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Davies argues that artworks should be identified, not with artistic products such as paintings or novels, but instead with the artistic actions or processes that produced such items.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Davies's invocation of modally flexible events such as 'doings' or 'happenings' seems metaphysically unpromising as an empirical hypothesis.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Thus the normal sense in which it is true that Picasso could have painted a certain brushstroke later is the sense in which the relevant brushstroke action A, occurring at time t1, might not have existed or occurred at all, but instead some other brushstroke action B, of the same type as A, occurring at a later time t2 and having the same effect, might have existed.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "But in this account there is no single action token such that it might have happened either at time t1 or at time t2 and hence no room for modally rich actions as such.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
