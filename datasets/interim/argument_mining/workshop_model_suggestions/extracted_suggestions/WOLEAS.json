  "Denis Diderot's natural philosophy is deeply and centrally 'biologistic': as it emerges in the mid-eighteenth century, thus right before the appearance of the term 'biology' as a way of designating a unified science of life, his project is motivated by the desire both to understand the laws governing organic beings and to emphasize, more 'philosophically', the uniqueness of organic beings within the physical world as a whole.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "What possible relation could there be between Spinozism and epigenesis?": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Epigenesis has been many things to many people.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Diderot's biological project is inseparable from claims which are not themselves restrictively biological; he is the proponent of a (programmatic) Spinozist biology.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "The juxtaposition (or articulation) is surprising: there are ancient and modern Spinozists, and what characterizes the latter is essentially their commitment to epigenesis.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Diderot articulates a connection between Spinozism and epigenesis in two very different kinds of texts: an apparently academic, precise entry in the Encyclopédie which combines (or juxtaposes) these different dimensions in a surprising way, and a more speculative, experimental series of reflections in the Rêve de D'Alembert.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Diderot's Spinozist biology, and epigenesis as the moment of invention of vital materialism, are located in an unusual conceptual space - neither a standard contribution to metaphysical or otherwise systematic discussion of Spinoza, nor a contribution to positive life science destined to become a chapter in a history of science survey.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "One must not confuse the ancient Spinosists with the modern Spinosists. The general principle of the latter is that matter is sensitive; they demonstrate this by the development of the egg, an inert body which by the sole means [instrument] of graduated heat moves to the state of a sensing, living being, and by the growth of any animal which in its inception [principe] is merely a point, and through the nutritive assimilation of plants and - in one word - of all substances that serve the purpose of nutrition, becomes a great sensing and living body in a greater [expanse of] space.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "Do you see this egg? It is with this [egg] that we overturn all schools of theology and all the temples of the world. What is this egg? An unsensing mass prior to the introduction of the seed [germe]; and after the seed has been introduced, what is it then? An unsensing mass, for the seed itself is merely an inert, crude fluid. How will this mass move to another [level of] organization, to sensibility and life? By means of heat. What will heat produce therein? Movement.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "Diderot's 'epigenetic Spinozism' is a different conceptual entity from what we find in histories of biology.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
