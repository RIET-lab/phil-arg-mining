  "'Languages are the measure of mankind's ideas', declared Anne Robert Jacques Turgot (1727-1781) in his second discourse at the Sorbonne in 1750, before abandoning an ecclesiastical career for administrative service (Turgot 1913: 223).": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Though he is remembered today mainly for his writings on political economy, epistemological and linguistic questions played a major role in the development of Turgot's philosophy.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "At first, around 1750, he assumed a firm if hypothetical correspondence between objects, ideas, and their representation in language.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Several years afterwards, however, Turgot cast doubt on the adequacy of human cognition and its correspondence to external reality.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "According to Turgot, all human beings perceive objects in the same manner, external objects are supposed to exist as causes of perceptions, and sensations are everywhere identical, constituting the basis of similar ideas.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Turgot declares it unnecessary to prove this point, and further claims that the fact we have different perceptions of an object under various circumstances also proves there must be an external item to which all these modifications relate.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "In the article Existence, Turgot treads a Lockean path by trying to explain the notion through a search for its origin.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Turgot explains that we convey the consciousness of the self onto external objects, thus making their existence stem from, or depend on human self-perception.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Since the existence of external objects is fundamentally grounded in human self-consciousness, Turgot does not hesitate to consider the implications he ridiculed in his critique of Maupertuis.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "The Encyclop√©die entry ends by basing the existence of external objects and the permanence of the self on an inductive method, which is not infallible or certain but merely endowed with a high degree of probability.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Turgot's linguistic historicism, accompanied by his experimental method, led him to assert an additional notion - the socio-pragmatic aspect of linguistic change.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "The recognition of Berkeley's challenge to sensualist epistemology was accompanied by an emphasis on the unique role of language as the medium through which human knowledge developed and a mediator between incommensurable channels of perception.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20"
