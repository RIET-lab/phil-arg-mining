  "Leibniz claims that for every possible substance S there is an individual concept that includes predicates describing everything that will ever happen to S, if S existed.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "Many commentators have thought that this leads Leibniz to think that all properties are had essentially, and thus that it is not metaphysically possible for substances to be otherwise than the way their individual concept has them as being.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "Against this common way of reading Leibniz's views on the metaphysics of modality, this essay develops a model in which individual concepts are innocent; that is, individual concepts are divine ideas that permit God to know everything that will ever happen to all possible substances, if created, but these individual concepts neither require that all properties are had essentially nor require that it is metaphysically necessary for substances to be the way their individual concepts have them as being.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "Unfortunately for the proponent of superessentialism, as is often the case in Leibnizian exegesis, things are not as straightforward as they seem.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "It is the main goal of this paper to sketch an alternative rational reconstruction, one that preserves an innocent reading of individual concepts and thus allows for metaphysical contingency.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "The goal of this paper has not been to argue that innocent individual concepts with transworld identity is the best reading of Leibniz; rather, the main goal has been to argue that the argument from Leibniz's CIC doctrine to superessentialism is not inescapable and that there is enough underdetermination in the key Leibniz's texts to allow for non-superessentialist readings in his metaphysics of modality.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "For Leibniz, substantial forms are the individual natures of substances, and as such they are not individual concepts or even parts of individual concepts; they are not divine ideas; rather, individual natures or individual substantial forms are represented in divine ideas.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "This is how a primitive force unifies and metaphysically individuates a given substance, for Leibniz.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
