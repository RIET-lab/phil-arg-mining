  "We retain, instead, that there are not two classes of quantum states, entangled and factorizables, but only a single classes of states: the entangled states.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "In the same way, there are not partitions of quantum system which have an ontological superior status with respect to any other.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "For all these reasons, both mathematical tools utilized (i.e quantum partitions or degrees of freedom) are responsible of improper classification of quantum systems.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Finally, we argue that we cannot speak about a classification of quantum systems: all the quantum states exhibit a unique objective nature, they are all entangled states.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Therefore, entanglement is not a special case, but is ubiquitous in quantum systems.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "In this sense, all states are entangled; entanglement is not an exceptional feature of some states but is ubiquitous in QM.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "To conclude, we think that the epistemic element is the possibility to 'choice' the degrees of freedom of quantum system: this possibility affect the classification of quantum states in entangled or factorizables.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
