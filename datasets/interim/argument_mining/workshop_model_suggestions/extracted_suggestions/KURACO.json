  "The aim of this article is to examine Edmund Husserl's theory of aesthetic consciousness and the possibility to apply it to site-specific art.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "I claim that strongly site-specific art, which is a work of art about a place and in the place, challenges the view that the synthetic unity of the aesthetic object is limited.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Moreover, following Husserl's theory, it becomes questionable whether strongly site-specific art is art at all.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "I try to answer these objections by explaining how the artist prescribes the appearances and boundaries of a strongly site-specific object of art, thereby satisfying the demand for the limitedness of the synthetic unity of the aesthetic object.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "I claimed that the degree of limitedness of the synthetic unity of a not site-specific work of art is greater than that of a strongly site-specific work of art.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "I also claimed that if we compare the positional and the aesthetic attitude, we see that the synthetic unity of an aesthetic object is restricted compared to the infinite or universal synthetic unity of perceptual objects, and that it is also true in the case of strongly site-specific art - the boundaries and the optical appearances of the specific space are prescribed by the artist.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Accordingly, if the beholder wants to contemplate aesthetically the object of art created by the artist, he or she has to take these restrictions into account.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Therefore, the artist has an important role to play in defining the limits of the appearances of a strongly site-specific work of art, and it is still possible to experience a strongly site-specific work as a work of art.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "aesthetic consciousness has interest in the manner of appearing of the object": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "Strongly site-specific works of art have frames and these are prescribed by the artist": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "Our aesthetic experience pertains to a very specific place and is turned toward the appearing of the space visible to us under the conditions set by the artist": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
