  "Panentheism has recently become a widely accepted and appreciated concept among scholars in the science-theology dialogue, and its theological repercussions have been discussed to great extent.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Yet, there remains to be studied in more detail the notion of the philosophical foundations of the term.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "A prominent gap in our understanding of these foundations is the potential similarity between the metaphysics of Hegel and Whitehead, their understanding of the transcendence and immanence of God, and their respective versions of panentheism.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "In this article, I present a critical reflection on the possible resemblance between process thought and Hegelian metaphysics and philosophy of God.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "In the last section I refer to those who use panentheism within the science-theology dialogue.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "I try to specify which of the two versions of panentheism, that of Hegel or Whitehead, is more popular among those scholars.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Because of its reference to the God-world relationship, panentheism tends to be regarded a purely theological concept.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "But it is not.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "This expressivist version of philosophical panentheism became a source of theological panentheistic propositions presented in the contemporary science/theology debate.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "But there is one more crucial point of reference for many of those who adopt philosophical panentheism, namely Whitehead's philosophy of process.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "After we have named two main philosophical sources of contemporary panentheism, the question should be asked whether they are complementary or distinctive.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Does the Whitehedian dipolar notion of God resemble expressivist Hegelian Panentheism?": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Is there a relation between these two synoptic thinkers in the tradition of western philosophy?": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "The case is problematic.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "As one can see, different scholars seem to support opposite positions, which shows the need for clarifying the problem.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "That 'panentheism' has recently become a widely accepted and appreciated concept among scholars who committed themselves to the science/theology debate within the Anglo-American context is clear and undeniable.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "Because of its reference to the God-world relationship, panentheism tends to be regarded a purely theological concept. But it is not. Its origins are in philosophy and go back to Plato and Neoplatonism.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "After we have named two main philosophical sources of contemporary panentheism, the question should be asked whether they are complementary or distinctive. Does the Whitehedian dipolar notion of God resemble expressivist Hegelian Panentheism? Is there a relation between these two synoptic thinkers in the tradition of western philosophy?": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "The first characteristic that can be regarded as a common feature of Hegel's and Whitehead's philosophy is their attempt to build a philosophical system. They are both interested in 'organic wholeness'.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "Like all panentheists, both Hegel and Whitehead struggle to defend God's otherness. From what has been said one can see that the Hegelian God is more transcendent. He is still the Creator who can be conceived before the existence of the world.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "The Whitehedian God is less free, as he has to necessarily prehend and objectify in his consequent nature all actual occasions. He is not a creator anymore, but rather a part of the atomistic system of the universe.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
