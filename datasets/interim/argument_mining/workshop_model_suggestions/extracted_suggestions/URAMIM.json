  "I defend a limited use of the decision theory model of reasoning in cases of normative uncertainty.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "I want to analyze whether these kinds of uncertainties should have practical consequences for actions and whether there are reliable methods of reasoning that deal with the possibility that we understand some crucial moral issues wrong.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "There are many ways in which you can be uncertain about the morally important aspects of your action.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Let me start this part with a typical example discussed in the literature.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Probably the most obvious proposition how to act under normative uncertainty is My Favorite Theory approach.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Although this approach looks very intuitive, there are interesting counter-examples.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "In this paper I sketched the problem of meta-reasoning in making moral decisions under normative uncertainty.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "I found that there is a promising type of meta-reasoning proposed by Ross (2006) that could be applied to some cases of normative uncertainty.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "However, it is worth noting that this kind of meta-reasoning has been recently extensively criticized.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "The simple fact is that even when we feel quite certain about moral issues, we are susceptible to mistakes.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "The most promising approach is to try to extend the decision theory model of reasoning to encompass normative uncertainty": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "But this model, when used to guide our action in moral terms, is highly controversial.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "The main problem that the supporters of this approach have to deal with is the question of intertheoretic comparisons of value.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
