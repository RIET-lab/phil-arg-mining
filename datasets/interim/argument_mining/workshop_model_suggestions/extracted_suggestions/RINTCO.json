  "I argue through a detailed examination of the texts that this view is a complete misrepresentation.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "Those of the writers under discussion who employ the concept of disinterestedness (which not all of them do) do not give it the so-called 'perceptual' meaning that Stolnitz does, and none of them use it to define a specifically 'aesthetic' mode of perception, attention, pleasure, or anything else.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "The governing concept of their aesthetic thought was neither 'disinterestedness' nor 'the aesthetic' but (with the exception of Shaftesbury) 'taste.'": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "I shall argue, however, that his historical view is not correct at all.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "The writers Stolnitz discusses are indeed sources of modern aesthetic thought, but they are not sources of the concept that he purports to find in them, that of so-called 'aesthetic disinterestedness.'": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "The nearest thing that any of these writers had to a concept of 'the aesthetic' was the concept of taste, which differs from Stolnitz's concept of the aesthetic in several essential respects; notably in that it is not defined (though it is sometimes characterized) by the concept of disinterestedness.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "The decline of the theory of the aesthetic attitude therefore should not be allowed to take the eighteenth-century writers with it: they are worth recovering from Stolnitz's own recovery attempt.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "It is evident that when Stolnitz speaks of 'aesthetic disinterestedness,' he does not use the word 'disinterested' in any of these senses.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "In the present essay, I shall merely argue that no such concept is to be found in eighteenth-century British aesthetic thought.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Stolnitz's concept of 'aesthetic disinterestedness' is nowhere to be found in the texts.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "There is in his writings no such concept as 'aesthetic interest' or 'disinterested perception.'": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Of all the writers discussed by Stolnitz, Alison comes closest to having the concept of an aesthetic attitude, in that he has a conception of a 'state of mind . . . most favorable to the emotions of taste.'": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "There is a widely held view, due to the work of Jerome Stolnitz, that the concept of a distinctively aesthetic mode of perception, one defined by the characteristic of disinterestedness, originated with such writers as Shaftesbury, Addison, Hutcheson, Burke, and Archibald Alison.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
