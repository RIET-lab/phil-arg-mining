  "Dichotomies are artifacts that we devise with some useful purpose in mind, but when inflated into absolute dichotomies they become metaphysical bogeys as it is illustrated by the twentieth century distinction between fact and value.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "The familiar contrast of 'normative or evaluative' as opposed to the factual is in need, like so many dichotomies, of elimination.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "On Putnam's account, harmless and innocent distinctions become - at least in some cases - metaphysical bogeys when inflated into absolute dichotomies.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "What Hilary Putnam has shown is that the 'scientific spirit' that was embodied by that fetish is simply unscientific, and not only does not deserve any respect at all, but on the contrary has to be denounced systematically as a treason to philosophy and an attack on human flourishing.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Classical American philosophers did not refuse to use these terms; instead their point was that these notions refer to distinctions made in thought rather to different kinds of being or levels of existence. That is, these terms have a functional rather an ontological status; they stand for useful distinctions made within reflection, and not for different kinds of being, discrete and separate prior to reflection.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "the fact/value dichotomy is, at bottom, not a distinction but a thesis, namely the thesis that 'ethics' is not about 'matters of fact'": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "any dichotomy, like the fact/value dichotomy (which has been consistently rejected by Putnam as a metaphysical bogey), is also an artifact, a product of the human mind": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
