  "Consciousness, rather than being an awkward addition to quantum theory, emerges as the simple truth underlying measurement itself—the natural bridge between quantum potentiality and classical reality.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "The act of observation, central to both quantum mechanics and consciousness studies, might represent another simple truth obscured by apparent complexity.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
