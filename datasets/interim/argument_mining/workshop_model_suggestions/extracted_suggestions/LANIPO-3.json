  "Can a literary text ever have hidden depths? Are bad readings ever superficial? And is it ever helpful to talk this way? I'm going to suggest that the answer to all three questions is yes.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "The reality, of course, is very different.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "If the above interpretation is true, I hope it follows uncontroversially that there's a more and a less illuminating way to read the Austen sentence.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Now I see no reason not to call the less illuminating reading a superficial reading: the sentence superficially presents Darcy as getting even more puffed up than he was before but turns out, at a deeper level, to be working very differently.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "The text has hidden depths, and a reading that does not uncover them is itself a shallow one.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Austen wants her readers to make a mistake, and then, ideally, go on to correct it.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Recognizing that Austen is setting traps for us like this-right from the famous first sentence, in fact-should nudge us in the direction of trying to figure out why.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Perhaps it's supposed to chip away at our self-assurance, via the very process of reading.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Perhaps it's supposed to help us turn ourselves into more discerning and careful readers-not just of novels but also of the world.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "Depth is multifarious; it is often deliberate; it is frequently salutary; and there is nothing wrong, it seems to me, with calling it by its name.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Understanding the hauteur passage in Pride and Prejudice doesn't just clear up a local mystery about Darcy's frame of mind; it encourages us to think completely differently about the way in which the novel works, the nature of our reading experience, and what the entire enterprise is for.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Our encounters with texts like those above-enigmatic texts, ironic texts, and the like-are encounters in which our initial understanding is not just mistaken but radically mistaken.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "The text before us becomes a new kind of object, requiring a new set of operations, offering a new set of experiences, designed to have a whole new function.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Reading a novel with hidden depths is not like scanning a landscape, or turning an object around in our hands, or opening the curtains wider to get a better view.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "It's not just that we didn't see the whole picture; it's that we got the key points totally wrong.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Artworks frequently contain features that are hidden.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Many such features are there intentionally, having been deliberately introduced by the author.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "Accordingly, one can read for depth without being a suspicious or symptomatic hermeneut.": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
  "If the above interpretation is true, I hope it follows uncontroversially that there's a more and a less illuminating way to read the Austen sentence. The less illuminating way is to take it at face value, as a straightforward depiction of Darcy's emotional state; the more illuminating way is to see behind its subtle trickery and realize that Austen is setting a trap for us.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "At least in this case, depth is something deliberately created by the author. Austen wants her readers to make a mistake, and then, ideally, go on to correct it.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "What changes, when we read it correctly, is not just our understanding of what it means; it's also our understanding of what it does.": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
