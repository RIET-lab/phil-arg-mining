  "It seems an unaccountable pleasure, which the spectators of a well written tragedy receive from sorrow, terror . . . and other passions, which are in themselves disagreeable and uneasy. The more they are touched and affected, the more are they delighted with the spectacle. . . . The whole art of the poet is employed in rousing and supporting the compassion and indignation, the anxiety and resentment of his audience.
