This paper introduces and contrasts two central strategies for approaching the question of the divine in a non- or post-ontotheological manner. The first and more established approach is that of post-Heideggerian hermeneutics and deconstruction, inspired by Heidegger's suggestion of a'theology without the word'being'' and by his later notions of an'ultimate god' and of'divinities' as one of the four axes of the fourfold ( Geviert ). Here, the divine is no longer articulated in terms of the supreme or absolute being, but as one of the interdependent dimensions of finite and contextual meaningful presence. The more recent approach introduced by Alain Badiou and Quentin Meillassoux dissociates itself from the Heideggerian hermeneutics of finitude and adopts mathematics as its basic ontological model. Rather than focusing on meaning and sense, Badiou and Meillassoux replace ontotheological metaphysics with materialist frameworks. With regard to the divine, this approach leads either to a contemporary version of atheism (Badiou) or to the reintroduction of a divine entity, but now a merely possible and contingent one (Meillassoux).\n\nKeywords: Heidegger, Badiou, Meillassoux, ontotheology, metaphysics, God, divine, theology, hermeneutics, materialism\n\n## 1. Hermeneutical and materialist post-ontotheologies\n\nThe concept of ontotheology and the analysis of the ontotheological constitution of the Western metaphysical tradition-of the inherent tendency of metaphysics to posit an absolute point of reference for all beings, identified by Aristotle\n\nand Aristotelian Scholasticism with the metaphysical divinityhave been among the most prominent aspects of Martin Heidegger's philosophical legacy. The hermeneutical and deconstructive'weak' perspectives on theology, religion, and the divine introduced by thinkers such as Jacques Derrida, Gianni Vattimo, Jean-Luc Marion, John Caputo, Richard Kearney, and Merold Westphal have been particularly inspired by Heidegger's allusion, in a 1951 seminar in Z√ºrich, to the idea of a theology without the word'being' 1 -hence the title of Marion's God without Being ( Dieu sans l'√™tre, 1988)-and by the enigmatic and underdeveloped description, in Contributions to Philosophy ( Beitr√§ge zur Philosophie, 1936-38), of an'ultimate god' ( der letzte Gott ) that is sharply differentiated from the ontotheological God of Aristotelian metaphysics and Christian Scholasticism. In France, the prominence of the postHeideggerian philosophical interest in religion was addressed by Dominique Janicaud (1991; Janicaud et al. 2000) as a'theological turn' in French phenomenology.\n\nHowever, in recent years, we have witnessed the emergence of a very different approach to ontotheology-one that, to a certain extent, accepts Heidegger's diagnosis of a strong ontotheological tendency inherent in Western metaphysics, yet rejects many of the philosophical consequences that Heidegger draws from this diagnosis. This is the avenue introduced by Alain Badiou and further developed by his pupil, Quentin Meillassoux. For Badiou and Meillassoux, the closure of ontotheology by no means implies a radical rupture or transformation of the classical philosophical project as such. Non-ontotheological thinking, they argue, does not necessarily entail a fundamental overhaul of the Western philosophical tradition as a whole or a hermeneutic embracement of a'weak' thinking devoid of absoluteness and universality. They are specifically opposed to the Heideggerian finitization of thinking, the roots of which they trace back to Kant's critical philosophy. Meillassoux, in particular, has argued that Kant's'Copernican revolution,' with its shift of philosophical focus to the correlation between thinking and being that is subsequently thematized by Heidegger as a factical, context-sensitive, and historically situated process, has\n\nled to the progressive deabsolutization of thinking that Meillassoux precisely seeks to overcome by showing that it ultimately rests on an implicit absolute thesis, namely, that of absolute contingency. For both Badiou and Meillassoux, the tool required to overcome the contemporary philosophy of finitude is mathematics, the ontological appropriation of which-and that of post-Cantorian set theory in particular-allows nonontotheological ontological frameworks ultimately committed to forms of materialism.\n\nIn what follows, I will briefly compare the Heideggerian hermeneutical notion of post-ontotheological thinking to the Badiouan and Meillassouxian materialist versions. Such a preliminary comparison will enable us to see how replacing the meaning- and language-centered orientation of Heidegger's'poetic' or'correlationist' postmetaphysics (and, in a sense, of post-Kantian philosophy as a whole) with an approach based on the absolute ontological significance of mathematics and set theory can also lead to a new kind of rationalism regarding philosophy's relation to divinity and the divine.\n\n## 2. Divinity without'being': Heidegger and the ultimate god\n\nDespite its strong association with the Heideggerian deconstruction of Western metaphysics, the term'ontotheology' was not coined by Heidegger but-significantly from the point of view of Meillassoux's reading of Heidegger as a kind of'ultimate Kantian'-by Kant. In the transcendental dialectic of his first Critique, Kant (1998a, 699-700 [A 631-32; B 659-60]; 1998b, 584) distinguishes two main forms of rational theology: transcendental theology (a'deistic' approach to the deity based on the concepts of pure reason) and natural theology (a'theistic' approach based on concepts from empirical nature). Transcendental theology is further divided into ontotheology (based on purely conceptual arguments, e.g., that the concept of the supreme being necessarily entails its existence) and cosmotheology (based on the transcendental implications of a certain type of experience, e.g., that of one's own existence); the main types of natural theology are physicotheology (based on\n\nthe observed causal order of natural things) and moral theology (based on the moral order observed in the world). Construed as attempts to prove the objective reality of God as the supreme being, Kant argues, even cosmotheology and physicotheology are ultimately ontotheological modes of deducing the necessary existence of a supreme being from the necessity of the concept of a supreme being. This, however, is for Kant a speculative move that illegitimately supposes being (existence) to be a'real predicate,' an attribute that adds something to a concept and without which it would be less perfect. Transcendental theology can therefore only have a negative function immanent to reason: it shows that the structure of theoretical rationality inherently requires a transcendental ideal of perfection for which an objective counterpart can never be found in experience and the existence of which can therefore never be proven or disproven (Kant 1998a, 706-07 [A 640-41; B 668-69]; 1998b, 588). In his Critique of Practical Reason Kant (1996, 239-46; 2003, 167-77 [A 223-37; AA 124-32]) goes on to show that a form of moral theology, which shows the necessity of a supreme good as a practical postulate of moral agency and as an object of'moral faith,' remains viable and practically necessary, but this is precisely a nononto theological approach that does not constitute a theoretical'proof' of God's objective reality.\n\nIn the Kantian critique of ontotheology, and in the subsequent notion of the divinity as a regulative rational ideal to which it is illegitimate to attribute being in the sense of objective existence, it is possible to see a prototype of the Heideggerian'theology without'being'.' However, the Heideggerian use of the term'ontotheology' is much wider and has a broader historical perspective. 2 While Kant associates ontotheology with the use of ontological arguments for theological ends, historically associated with Scholasticism and Descartes, Heidegger employs the term to designate the use of theology for ontological purposes, a tendency paradigmatically exhibited by the basic structure of the Aristotelian Metaphysics.\n\nThe'first philosophy' that constitutes the subject matter of the Metaphysics is famously characterized by Aristotle as a science of being qua being ( to on h ƒì on; Metaphysics\n\nŒì.1.1003a21-32), i.e., as a general ontology of everything that in some sense is. The obvious problem of ontology as a science is its extreme generality. 'Being as such' cannot function as the most general kind or genus of all things ( Œí.3.998b22-27; Œó.6.1045b6; Posterior Analytics II.7.92b13-14); Aristotle's theory of definition precludes the possibility of one supreme genus that would comprise everything, since its subspecies could not be differentiated using meaningful criteria independent of the genus and the subspecies ( Metaphysics Œñ.12.1037b29-1038a35; Topics VI.6.144a28-b11). The supreme genera are thus the different categories and modalities of being, and being as such ( to on ) is a'transcendental' determination in the Scholastic sense of transcending the limits of even the supreme genera or kinds of beings and is itself without a general definition. Being is articulated in several different senses ( to on legetai pollach ≈ç s ) that are not reducible to any single basic meaning ( Œì.2.1003a33). Even so, 'being' is not a purely equivocal term; its many different senses are still related to a unity and to some single nature ( pros hen kai mian tina physin; 1003a33-34), to a single principle ( pros mian arch ƒì n; 1003b6). Like'being,' the term'healthy' ( hygieinon ) is used in several irreducibly different senses, but these are all related, albeit in different ways, to health as an ideal state of a living body: a healthy complexion is a sign of health, healthy habits are means for attaining and preserving health, and so on (1003a34-b4). In the case of being, the corresponding ideal or standard sense is ousia, 'substance' or, more broadly, 'beingness'-the mode of being of a separate, determinate, and ontologically independent particular thing (1003b6-19; Œñ.1.1028a10-b4). Ousia is the point of reference for the different senses and hierarchies of being: it is substantial being as opposed to predicable being, actuality as opposed to potency, and so on.\n\nHowever, concrete material substances involve a problematic ontological duality, exposed in Metaphysics Œñ, Œó, and Œò. On the one hand, their beingness-that which makes them the determinate things they are-consists in their species-form ( eidos ), i.e., that which makes them what they are, instantiations of a specific type of thing ( Œñ.3.1029a7-30;\n\n17.1041b5-9). On the other hand, form alone does not constitute a concrete spatiotemporal thing, a'this'; for this purpose, an additional individuating matter ( hyl ƒì ) is required ( Œó.1.1042a24-31). Because of the matter-form twofoldness, the beingness ( ousia ) of concrete material things cannot be the ultimate unifying reference point of all beings. This can only be an ideal entity, an ideal instance of ousiaperfectly simple and indivisible, perfectly actual and perfectly identical with its own essence ( Œõ.1.1069a18-b2; 6.1071b2-7). This is the God ( theos ) of metaphysics, the absolutely self-sufficient'thought thinking itself' ( no ƒì sis no ƒì se ≈ç s )-the ultimate'final cause' of all things, the unmoved mover whose ontological perfection all material, transient, and contingent things strive to emulate (7.1072a19b30; 8.1074a33-37; 9.1074b17-1075a5). When the particular structure of its subject matter is properly understood, ontology, the science of being as such, can only be realized in the form of theology, of the science of the supreme mode of being. 'General metaphysics' is implemented through a'special metaphysics,' but one that studies precisely the ultimate point of reference and ideal for all beings, i.e., the perfection of beingness ( Œï.1.1026a23-32).\n\nThis Aristotelian conflation of ontology and theology-the move of thinking that proves the ontological necessity of a supreme being and by so doing brings ontology to its culmination-is precisely what Heidegger understands by ontotheology. He repeatedly returns to the ontologicaltheological twofoldness of Aristotle's determination of first philosophy in his early lecture courses 3, and summarizes it in his 1949 introduction to What Is Metaphysics? in the following way:\n\n[‚Ä¶] metaphysics represents the beingness [ Seiendheit ] of beings in a twofold manner: in the first place, the totality of beings as such with an eye to their most universal traits ( on katholou, koinon ); but at the same time also the totality of beings as such in the sense of the highest and therefore divine being ( on katholou, akrotaton, theion ). In the metaphysics of Aristotle, the unconcealedness of beings as such is specifically developed in this twofold manner [‚Ä¶]. According to its essence, metaphysics is at the same time both ontology in the narrower sense, and theology. (Heidegger 1996, 378-79; 1998d, 287)\n\nThe term'ontotheology' is adopted in Heidegger's 193031 course on Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit to designate the tendency of Hegel's speculative idealism, inherited from ancient metaphysics, to orient the question of being to the divine, which Hegel grasps in terms of his speculative logic (Heidegger 1988b, 140-43; 1994b, 97-99). The term is then used repeatedly in connection with Plato (Heidegger 1996, 235-36; 1998d, 180-81), Kant (Heidegger 1996, 449; 1998d, 340), Hegel (Heidegger 1989, 206; 1999, 144; 2002c, 152; 2003b, 202-03; 2009, 81; 2012, 161), Schelling (Heidegger 1985, 51, 66; 1995b, 62, 79), and Nietzsche (Heidegger 1991d, 210; 1998c, 314). Heidegger's perhaps most lucid formulation of the ontotheological mode of thought can be found in his 1944-46 essay on'Nihilism as Determined by the History of Being':\n\nOf course, metaphysics acknowledges that beings [ Seiendes ] are not without being [ Sein ]. But scarcely has it said so when it again relocates being [ Sein ] in a being [ Seiendes ] [‚Ä¶]. The grounding of being-which has barely been given a thought-in the most-being [ Seiendsten ] of beings proceeds, in accordance with the metaphysical question, from beings as such. [‚Ä¶] Because metaphysics, in thinking beings as such, is approached by being but thinks it on the basis of and with reference to beings, metaphysics as such must therefore speak out ( legein ) the theion in the sense of the supremely being ground. Metaphysics is inherently theology. It is theology to the extent that it speaks out beings qua beings, on h ƒì on. Ontology is simultaneously and necessarily theology. (1991d, 208-09; 1998c, 311, 312, 313; tr. mod.)\n\nOntotheology, for Heidegger, is the approach in which the basic ontological question concerning being ( Sein ) as such-apart from all of its particular instances, all individual things that are, beings-encounters the universality and indeterminacy of'being as such' and theologically resorts to the supreme and ideal instance of being, the most-being of beings, as the absolute point of reference of all beings. While ontotheological metaphysics starts from the very acknowledgement of the fact that being as such is not identical with any particular thing that is, it ultimately fails to think this difference between being and that-which-is in positive terms (2002c, 274-75; 2003b, 36465). Precisely because of the fact that being as such is not determinable in the way specific beings are, ontotheology ends up determining being as such in terms of the supreme being. In\n\nhis most profound and demanding discussion of ontotheology, The Onto-theo-logical Constitution of Metaphysics (1957), Heidegger puts this in another way: since metaphysics essentially looks at being as the ground ( Grund ) of all that is, and thinks of ground in terms of a'cause' ( Ursache ) that is itself something determinate, it ends up pointing to God, the supreme being, as the primal (and ultimate) final cause of all things that is also its own cause.\n\n[‚Ä¶] the matter [ Sache ] of thinking is beings [ das Seiende ] as such, that is, being [ Sein ]. Being shows itself in the essential mode of a ground [ Grundes ]. Accordingly, the matter of thinking, being as the ground, is thought out fully only when the ground is represented as the first ground, pr ≈ç t ƒì arch ƒì. The original matter of thinking presents itself as the primal cause [ Ur-sache ], the causa prima that corresponds to the establishing [ begr√ºndenden ] recourse to the ultima ratio, the final account [ Rechenschaft ]. The being of beings is represented fundamentally, in the sense of the ground, only as causa sui. This is the metaphysical concept of God. Metaphysics must think in the direction of the deity because the matter of thinking is being-namely, being as ground, in diverse ways [‚Ä¶]. (2002a, 51; 2002b, 59-60; tr. mod.)\n\nIn Heidegger's historical narrative, ontotheological thinking originates with Plato, more specifically in Book VI of the Republic (508d4-509c2), where the Idea of the Good is singled out as the Idea of Ideas, as the Idea of ideality as such that makes possible all the other Ideas as the ideal conceptual identities of particular things (Heidegger 1996, 235-36; 1998d, 180-81). Since its Platonic-Aristotelian inauguration, Heidegger (2002a, 45; 2002b, 54) maintains, the basic framework of the entire ancient, medieval, and modern metaphysical tradition up to Hegel and Nietzsche remains ontotheological. That Heidegger views Nietzsche, the minister of the'death of God,' as a culmination of ontotheological thinking highlights the fact that his notion of ontotheology is not limited to the metaphysical models in which the metaphysical or Christian God holds an absolute position. Rather, ontotheology stands for the absolutizing tendency of Western philosophy as such, for the quest for an absolute point of reference for all things. Starting from Descartes, the Aristotelian-Neoplatonic-Scholastic deity gradually surrenders its metaphysical role to subjectivity, in the sense of the\n\nindubitably certain self-consciousness of the thinking ego. 4 Even Kant remains ontotheological in the Heideggerian sense: for Kant's transcendental idealism, the'unity of transcendental apperception,' i.e., the potential association of the representation'I think' with all other representations (Kant 1998a, 178-81, 215-16 [A 106-108; B 131-136]; 1998b, 24648), holds the role of a universal (albeit immanent and nonabsolute) point of reference. 5 The ontotheological hierarchy implicit in Kant's critical philosophy is absolutized in speculative idealism, particularly at the end of Hegel's Science of Logic, where the Absolute Idea-the absolutely comprehensive determination-is identified with being ( Sein ) in its dialectically fully unfolded sense (Hegel 1981, 236; 2010, 735; Heidegger 1997b, 383-384; 2006b, 339-40; 2008b, 46). Being as such and the supreme instance of being are thus conflated, and this is the first stage in the conclusion of ontotheology, one that leaves no more conceptual leeway for the development of metaphysics in its rational-speculative form. In Heidegger's reading, however, it is Nietzsche who makes the last move of modern ontotheology by replacing the theoretical and speculative notion of subjectivity with a willing subjectivity-with a notion of subjectivity as the will to power that ultimately wills nothing exterior to itself. 6\n\nThis narrative provides the cue for the key topic of Heidegger's later thinking, the'other beginning' ( der andere Anfang ) of Western thought delineated in Contributions to Philosophy and related texts. 7 Very generally speaking, the other beginning would transform the first (Greek) beginning(s) of philosophy and metaphysics into a post-Nietzschean and post-metaphysical approach that would renounce the quest for absoluteness altogether and hermeneutically embrace the radical finitude, historicity, and context-specificity of thinking. We cannot here go into the details of this fundamental transformation of which Heidegger produced only more or less preparatory and fragmentary drafts. However, what interests us with regard to our topic and from the point of view of the reappropriation of the Heideggerian critique of ontotheology in contemporary theology, are the transformations in the notions of the deity and divinity that the end of ontotheology would\n\nentail. Of this, Heidegger gives us some clues. At the end of The Onto-theo-logical Constitution of Metaphysics, he famously notes that'the god-less thinking which must abandon the god of philosophy, god as causa sui, is [‚Ä¶] perhaps closer to the divine [ g√∂ttlichen ] god.' (Heidegger 2002a, 64-65; 2002b, 72; tr. mod.)\n\nEven though Heidegger's brief draft on the'ultimate god' in the Contributions remains for the most part shrouded in the enigmatic postmetaphysical shorthand of the work and replete with nuances and aspects that we cannot begin to unravel here, its main outline is quite clear. 8 The ultimate god is'completely other to the previous ones, particularly to the Christian one' (Heidegger 1989, 403; 1999, 283; 2012, 319) and in this sense can be identified with the'divine god' to which the postontotheological'god-less thinking' remains open. Whereas the Christian God became interpreted in Aristotelian-Scholastic terms as the most-being of all beings and thus as the foundation of the hierarchical metaphysical'system of being,' the god of the Heideggerian'other beginning'\n\nis neither a'being' [ seiend ] nor an'non-being' [ unseiend ], and also not to be equated with beyng [ Seyn, i.e., postmetaphysically reconsidered being]. Rather, beyng abides [ west ] temporally and spatially as that'between' [ Zwischen ] that can never be grounded in god but also not in the human being as something occurring [ vorhandenes ] and living, but only in Da-sein. (Heidegger 1989, 263; 1999, 185-86; 2012, 207; tr. mod.) 9\n\nWhile ancient and medieval metaphysics situated the Archimedean point of'beings as a whole' in God's perfection and modern metaphysics relocated it in the immanence of the thinking (human) subjectivity, Heideggerian postmetaphysics makes both of these former points of reference interdependent dimensions or poles in a multidimensional and multipolar event of the spatiotemporal contextualization of meaningful presence, i.e., in the event or'taking-place' ( Ereignis ) of beyng ( Seyn ). Just like the Heideggerian'subject,' the human being who is no longer simply identical with Da-sein, i.e., with the dynamic context or place into which beyng'takes place,' but simply one of its essential contributors or participants, the Heideggerian deity has become radically deabsolutized: far from being the\n\nparadigm of self-sufficient and substantial being, the divine is merely one of the interdependent aspects of contextualized meaningfulness. It has no subsistence outside the process of contextualization but is radically dependent upon it. What is at stake in the postmetaphysical transformation is the'recognition of the belonging of the human being to beyng [ Seyn ] through god, the admission [ Eingest√§ndnis ] by god that it needs beyng, an admission that does not relinquish god or its greatness.' (Heidegger 1989, 413; 1999, 291; 2012, 327; tr. mod.) For Heidegger, an important aspect of the greatness of the postmetaphysical poet H√∂lderlin lies in the latter's invention, in Verse VIII of his hymn The Rhine, of a deabsolutized divinity, of a meaning-bestowing dimension that is itself dependent on being acknowledged and received by the human being. 10\n\nArguably the most developed account of the Heideggerian postmetaphysical divinity, and one that is deeply informed by H√∂lderlin's language, is the late account of the fourfold ( Geviert ), in which the'divinities' ( die G√∂ttlichen ) figure as one of the four meaning-dimensions that converge in the singular and situated meaningfulness of a particular thing. None of these dimensions, including the divine one, is independent of their reciprocal intertwining in the thing as a focal point of experienced meaning (Heidegger 2000b, 172; 2001a, 177). The divinities, in the plural, are the'beckoning [ winkenden ] envoys of the deity [ Gottheit ]. From the concealed prevailing [ Walten ] of these [divinities], god appears in its essence [ Wesen ], which withdraws it beyond any comparison with what is present [ dem Anwesenden ].' (2000b, 171; 2001a, 176; tr. mod.) The deity is the dimension of ultimate purpose-it is not a present and selfsubsistent entity but rather a dimension of radical futurity that appears and is encountered through its different aspects, the divine'indications' or'hints' ( Winke ) of an ultimate meaning. This god'has' no being but is a dimension of the meaningful taking-place ( Ereignis ) of being as a divinity always yet to come, not as an eschatological future present expected or anticipated by humans, but as the futural dimension of purpose towards which the'futural ones of the ultimate god' ( die Zuk√ºnftigen des letzten Gottes; 1989, 399; 1999, 280; 2012, 316), i.e., the\n\npostontotheological'theologians,' are primarily oriented and which in this sense'awaits' human beings (1989, 417; 1999, 293; 2012, 330).\n\n## 3. Against poetic theology and fideism: Badiou's contemporary atheism and Meillassoux's virtual god\n\nIn his Briefings on Existence ( Court trait√© d'ontologie transitoire, 1998), Alain Badiou presents a succinct but highly interesting discussion of what he calls Heidegger's'aporia,' referring to the latter's (Heidegger 2000a, 671; 1993b, 107) famous words in his 1966 interview for Der Spiegel: 'How can it be that the thinker who determined metaphysics as ontotheology, an overshadowing of the question of being [ √™tre ] by that of the supreme being [ √©tant ], ends up saying in his testament that only a god can save us?' (Badiou 1998, 18; 2006a, 27-28; tr. mod.) Badiou is well aware that Heidegger has in mind a type of god that is identical neither with the God of metaphysics nor with the God of the monotheistic religions, but rather corresponds to the H√∂lderlinian divinity, 'the God of poets,' an ultimate source of meaningfulness, 'that from which [‚Ä¶] there is the enchantment of the world.' (Badiou 1998, 1819; 2006a, 28) The passive prospect of a'divine intervention' involves a poetic, nostalgic, and melancholic vision of a'reenchantment' of the world through the emergence of a new dimension of ultimate purposiveness. Thus, the (Heideggerian) 'deconstruction of metaphysics and assent given to the death of the Christian God has held the chances open for the God of the poem.' (1998, 19; 2006a, 29)\n\n'To say'only a god can save us' means: the thinking informed by the poets [‚Ä¶] may uphold [‚Ä¶] the possibility, devoid of any way or means open to utterance, of a resacralization of the earth.' (1989, 32; 1999, 51; tr. mod.)\n\nFor Badiou, such a poetic longing for the arrival of divinity-as well as what he regards as Heidegger's'poetic ontology' as a whole-cannot avoid having reactionary intellectual and political implications, as is evident, he thinks, from Heidegger's attempt at overcoming contemporary'technical nihilism' and from his infamous political error.\n\n(1989, 7-12, 33-40; 1999, 27-32, 53-60) In Badiou's eyes, contemporary'antiphilosophy,' with its resigned pessimism regarding the prospects of the classical philosophical project and of the progressive enterprises of modernity in general, is directly informed by the Heideggerian'suturing' of philosophy to poetry and by the associated dream of a'salvation' in the form of a re-enchantment by meaning of the homogenized and inherently meaningless contemporary technical reality. (1989, 7-12, 21-26, 49-58; 1999, 27-32, 41-45, 69-77) Overcoming the late modern predicament therefore entails, Badiou maintains, the adoption of a'contemporary atheism,' one that surrenders not only the ontotheological divinity but the poetic one as well. (1998, 20; 2006, 29) A key point in this approach is the attack on the central topic of Heidegger's thinking: finitude, which Badiou sees as a part of contemporary philosophy's Kantian legacy. 11\n\nThat our exposure to being is essentially finite and that we must forever return to our mortal-being, is the fact from which we endure the living God's death only to uphold, under multiple shapes, the indistinct promise of a sense that has withdrawn, but whose'comeback' has not been debarred. [‚Ä¶] It is thus imperative, so as to be serenely established in the irreversible element of God's death, to finish up with the motif of finitude. [‚Ä¶] the aim is to finish up with the motif of finitude and its hermeneutical escort. (Badiou 1998, 20, 21; 2006a, 29, 30; tr. mod.)\n\nThe method for achieving this break with the Heideggerian hermeneutics of finitude is famously discovered by Badiou in mathematics-more specifically, in post-Cantorian set theory, with its revolutionary new way of mathematizing the infinite in the form of different infinite multiplicities with different cardinalities. The key ontological import of set theory is, for Badiou, its ability to dissociate the notion of infinity from the metaphysical notion of an ultimate and supreme unity of being, of an ultimate and absolute point of reference that would unify all finite and determinate things-in Aristotle's Metaphysics, the metaphysical God. From the recognition that all beings cannot be brought under one univocal concept or'set'-i.e., that there can be no'universal set,' that the totality of beings is an inconsistent multiplicity in Cantor's sense (Badiou 1988, 53; 2005, 41)-Aristotle deduced that ontology\n\nmust take recourse in the supreme being as the absolutely universal reference point, 'infinite' in the sense that it is beyond any material and spatiotemporal specificity. 12 This is precisely how Badiou defines ontotheology in his magnum opus, Being and Event, the main exposition of his equation of ontology with mathematics: ontotheology is the metaphysical approach'for which the absolute is thought as a supreme infinite being, thus as transmathematical, in-numerable, as a form of the one so radical that no multiple can consist therein.' (1988, 53; 2005, 42; cf. 1988, 161-62; 2005, 142-43) Against ontotheology, Badiou posits his mathematical, set-theoretical ontology, which accepts only consistent multiplicities-ones that can be treated as sets-and for which an inconsistent multiplicity simply is not, is non-being. In other words, for mathematical ontology, the one, in the sense of an ultimate and absolute unity, is not. (1988, 53-54; 2005, 42)\n\nThis is the foundational'decision' of Badiou's ontology, which he considers to be a break with the history of ontotheological metaphysics: there is no unity or totality of being, no Archimedean point for everything. Rather, being as such is pure, inconsistent multiplicity that resists all unification (1988, 33, 550, 555; 2005, 25, 511, 519). Unity pertains only to particular instances or'presentations' of being-'situations' or'worlds'-which are consistent multiplicities based on a unifying, structuring operation of'count-as-one' that determines what, in each particular situation, is to be counted as a being. (1988, 31-39, 104-05, 539, 557; 2005, 23-30, 90, 504, 522) Being as such, that which is fundamentally presented in all structured situations of being, is beyond consistent multiplicities and the unities they are composed of; it'is' a multiplicity only in retrospect, in the sense of'not-one,' of being beyond the structured sets that ontology operates with. For Badiou, such an ontology also constitutes a break with Heideggerian post-ontotheological hermeneutics, which still looks if not to an ultimate unity, at least to an ultimate dimension of sense and purpose inherent in being as the taking-place of finite and situated meaningfulness. Heidegger's'poetic' ontology is still preoccupied with what has always been the focal topic of metaphysics: being as meaningful\n\npresence or intelligibility, which accordingly sees ontology as a study of meaning (1988, 16; 2005 9-10). In its Badiouan sense as the inconsistent multiplicity that precedes all structured consistency, being is the inherently meaning less, homogenous, undifferentiated, and inarticulate'raw material' of situations or worlds. As Badiou points out in a 1997 interview with Peter Hallward, this can be rendered as a fundamentally materialist approach: ''Matter' would simply be, immediately after being, the most general possible name of the presented (of'what is presented'). [‚Ä¶] I am a materialist in the sense that I think that any presentation is material.' (Badiou 2001, 130) Such a mathematical, materialist ontology invites us to restitute the infinite to the banality of manifold-being [‚Ä¶]. [‚Ä¶] the destiny of every situation is the infinite manifold of sets. Depth cannot ever develop there, and the homogeneity of the manifold ontologically prevails over the play of intensities. [‚Ä¶] the search for sense is reduced for us to the sole numbering of this infinity [‚Ä¶]. (Badiou 1998, 21-22; 2006, 30)\n\nOne of the central accomplishments of this model is, for Badiou, that it makes any notion of divinity superfluous. It confirms the'death,' proclaimed by Nietzsche, of the Christian God; by abandoning the notion of ultimate unity, it dispenses with the need for the ontotheological God of metaphysics; and thirdly, it also makes the Heideggerian post-ontotheological divinity, the'God of poetry' unnecessary by adopting a basic'nihilism' in the sense of an understanding of being as such as inherently meaning less. What Badiou shares with his great contemporary Deleuze is a commitment to a fundamental immanence, divested of all references to transcendence, either ontotheologically or hermeneutically conceived. 13'Committed to the triple destitution of the gods, we [‚Ä¶] can assert that everything is here, always here, and that thought's reserve lies in the thoroughly informed and firmly declared egalitarian platitude of what befalls upon us here.' (Badiou 1998, 23; 2006, 31) The sole dimension of purpose lies within the subjective truth-processes-politics, art, science, and love-that indefinitely reconfigure the world of immanence in terms of a potentially transformative historical event; thus, for Badiou (1997; 2003), even the apostle Paul becomes a pre-eminently\n\npolitical figure, faithfully committed to the revolutionizing event of Christ's death. 14\n\nIn his breakthrough work After Finitude: An Essay on the Necessity of Contingency ( Apr√®s la finitude: essai sur la n√©cessit√© de la contingence, 2006), Quentin Meillassoux adopts the essential core of the Badiouan understanding of ontotheology and of the problematic consequences of the Heideggerian attempt at overcoming it. As is announced by its title, the book is essentially aimed at uncovering the inner inconsistencies and philosophical limitations of the Kantian topic of the inherent finitude of thinking and its hermeneutical developments and variations. Meillassoux's argumentation is informed by his brilliant analysis of what he sees as the dominant framework of Western philosophy as a whole since Kant: correlationism, the approach that sets out from the philosophical irreducibility of the correlation between being and thinking (in the widest possible sense that comprises knowledge, experience, consciousness, discourse, language, and willing) and maintains that being and thinking are inconceivable apart from one another (Meillassoux 2006a, 18-23; 2008a, 5-9). In addition to Kantian transcendental idealism ('weak correlationism'), which retains the necessity of an absolute (but unknowable) level of'things in themselves' beyond the domain of the transcendental structures of the correlation-and was later converted by Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel into an absolute idealism that denies the intelligibility of things in themselves and absolutizes the correlation itself-the correlationist framework also comprises the Heideggerian hermeneutics of finitude ('strong correlationism'), which denies the intelligibility of things in themselves but also promotes the radical facticity (i.e., non-absoluteness, matter-of-factness, lack of absolute justification) of the correlation, thus denying thinking access to any kind of absolute. (Meillassoux 2006a, 4260; 2008a, 30-43)\n\nThrough a highly original and intricate chain of argumentation Meillassoux (2006a, 69-109; 2008a, 50-81) concludes, however, that in order to truly distinguish itself from absolute idealism and to avoid internal contradiction, strong correlationism must ultimately absolutize its principle of\n\nfacticity-i.e., maintain that an absolute entity or level of being is not only inconceivable and unthinkable but in fact absolutely impossible, thus turning the principle of facticity into an absolute principle of contingency. All experienced things, all the structures of experiences, as well as experience as such, i.e., the prevailing of the correlation itself, are not only given to thinking as mere facts without any visible absolute logical necessity, but indeed absolutely unfounded, unnecessary, and contingent facts. But if this is the case, the strong correlationist deabsolutization of thinking has ultimately failed: it is compelled to retain a'minimal absoluteness,' i.e., the absolute validity of the non-absoluteness of all things as such. It is necessary that nothing -no thing or event, not even the happening of the correlation between being and thinking, i.e., the taking-place of meaningful presenceis necessary. As is shown especially by Heidegger's'transcendentalization' of mortality, of the experience of the'possibility of its own impossibility' as the ultimate possibility of Dasein (Heidegger 2001b, 260-267, 316-323; 2010, 249-255, 302-309), the absence of the correlation-and, thus, a reality without thinking-is absolutely conceivable. But if this is accepted, the correlationist framework bursts apart and strong correlationism is converted into what Meillassoux (2006a, 168; 2008a, 121) terms a speculative materialism: an absolute certainty of the thinkability of being-without-thinking. 15 However, the thinking that can think this reality beyond meaningful presence can obviously no longer assume the form of a phenomenology or hermeneutics of sense and meaning. Following Badiou, Meillassoux (2006a, 37, 176-77; 2008a, 26, 127-28) claims that it can operate only in terms of mathematics. Mathematics, and set theory in particular, is the formal method of thinking a reality independent of thinking.\n\nMeillassoux's speculative philosophy is a genuine system in the sense that it professes to deduce all of its elements from its fundamental principle, namely, that of absolute contingency. Even the absolute bearing of mathematics is to be thus derived, although Meillassoux has thus far postponed this derivation to forthcoming works (2006a, 152-53; 2008a, 110-11). Meillassoux's refutation of ontotheology is as such not directly\n\nbased on the acceptance of a mathematical ontology, but is an independent direct consequence of the principle of contingency. By absolutizing facticity, we obtain the thesis that it is absolutely necessary that every being [ √©tant ] might not exist. This is indeed a speculative thesis, since we are thinking an absolute, but it is not metaphysical, since we are not thinking any thing (any being) that would be absolute. The absolute is the absolute impossibility of a necessary being. (2006a, 82; 2008a, 60; tr. mod.)\n\nWe see from this dissociation of speculative thinking (one that claims access to some form of absolute) and metaphysical thinking (one that claims access to some form of absolute being ) that Meillassoux understands'metaphysics' in a strongly Heideggerian sense, one that coincides with'ontotheology,' i.e., with the positing of a'supreme being' as an absolute point of reference for all things. Meillassoux, too, thus subscribes to the diagnosis of the end of metaphysics. Like Badiou, however, he disagrees with the specific postmetaphysical prospects of Heideggerian hermeneutics. Meillassoux's specific point of contention with Heidegger is the latter's notion that renouncing ontotheological absolutes inevitably means renouncing all philosophical absolutes. After Finitude aims to show that'not all speculation is metaphysical, and not every absolute is dogmatic-it is possible to envisage an absolutizing [ absolutoire ] thought that would not be absolutist.' (2006a, 47; 2008a, 34) What Meillassoux explicitly commits himself to is the critique of the'de-absolutizing implication', according to which'if metaphysics is obsolete, so is the absolute.' (2006a, 47; 2008a, 34) While his argument against total deabsolutization is that it is ultimately a self-defeating intellectual project that cannot avoid recourse to an absolute principle, his basic motivation for attacking it is, as with Badiou, related to the theological implications of Heideggerian post-ontotheology. While the hermeneutical deconstruction of ontotheology will undermine previously established forms of rational theology, Meillassoux maintains that this deconstruction has simultaneously opened the door to purely faith -based and'irrational' versions of religiosity Meillassoux designates as fideism.\n\n[‚Ä¶] by destroying metaphysics [‚Ä¶] one has inadvertently justified belief's claim to be the only means of access to the absolute. [‚Ä¶] the de-absolutization of thought boils down to the mobilization of a fideist argument; but a fideism that is'fundamental'' rather than merely'historical'' in naturethat is to say, a fideism that has become thought's defence of religiosity in general, rather than of a specific religion [‚Ä¶]. The contemporary end of metaphysics is an end which, being sceptical, could only be a religious end of metaphysics. (2006a, 63-64; 2008a, 45-46.)\n\nAs the two most prominent representatives of a fideist'aspiration towards an absoluteness which would no longer retain anything metaphysical, and which one is generally careful to designate by another name,' Meillassoux (2006a, 6667; 2008a, 48) cites the evocation of the'mystical' in Wittgenstein's Tractatus as well as Heidegger's idea of a'theology without'being'.' As Wittgenstein and Heidegger are for him also the central thinkers of strong correlationism (2006a, 56-57; 2008a, 41-42), he concludes that'fideism is merely the other name for strong correlationism.' This is one of the most problematic claims of Meillassoux's After Finitude. One cannot help wondering what really justifies the use of the term'absolute' in connection with these two approaches which, as Meillassoux himself points out, precisely avoid presenting divinity as an'absolute' in the traditional sense of something radically self-sufficient and self-subsistent. Moreover, the applicability of the term'fideism' to the late Heidegger's'theological' sketches, in which the postmetaphysical relation to the divinity or divinities is precisely not described in terms of faith, is highly questionable, as is Meillassoux's interpretation according to which Heidegger planned a theology that should contain'nothing philosophical.' However, his general idea according to which conceiving God not as an entity but as a dimension of transcendence that resists objectification makes not only rational theology but also the rational a theology superfluous, seems more defensible. Wittgenstein and Heidegger indeed seem to render discussions concerning the existence and non-existence of the deity as well as its modalities (necessity, possibility, contingency) effectively meaningless.\n\nIt is important to see that while Meillassoux's underlying philosophical project is essentially directed against the'theological turn' in post-Heideggerian phenomenology and hermeneutics, it is not the program of Badiou's'contemporary atheism' that he is implementing, but something even more novel and unexpected, namely, the reintroduction of an explicitly philosophical notion of God as a being/entity, but one that is no longer the ontotheological necessary being but a merely possible and contingent one. Even though the definitive form of his relevant work remains unpublished, Meillassoux has already announced a forthcoming, completely reworked and extended version of his 1997 doctoral dissertation on'divine inexistence' ( L'inexistence divine; 2006a, 67n1; 2008a, 132n15). On the basis of his dissertation (significant excerpts of its revised version have been published in an English translation in Graham Harman's study on Meillassoux; Harman 2011, 175238), of an independently published article (Meillassoux 2006b; 2008b), and of certain hints present in his recently published reading of Mallarm√© (2011a; 2012), we already have an inkling of the direction in which Meillassoux is taking us. 16 By all accounts, it seems he is developing a notion of a God-entity that, as a matter of fact, does not exist, but in which it is nevertheless rationally legitimate to place one's faith since-in accordance with the principle of radical contingency-it can be, just as well as anything else. This divinity is not to be confused with the'God who may be' of Richard Kearney's (2001; 2002) deeply Heideggerian account; the latter is articulated in terms of pure potentiality ( dynamis ) as a divinity whose presence will not assume the form of the actuality of a substance, but consists in a mere futural indication or reference. Meillassoux's'God to come' is rather'possible' in the Deleuzian sense of virtuality, i.e., a possibility that is in no way foreshadowed or implied by what precedes it, but can only emerge ex nihilo, as an absolute novelty, compared by Meillassoux to the emergence of life from the world of matter and to the emergence of thought from the world of biological life (Harman 2011, 175-93). 17 In a striking speculative retake of Kantian moral theology, Meillassoux emphasizes the ethical importance of a hope, without any supporting'evidence' but formally legitimized by speculative\n\nmaterialism, of the emergence a radically novel divine entity that would redeem the traditional promises of the moral divinity-the enactment of a supreme good and of a supreme justice for the dead and the living-in a way that does not give rise to the immense traditional problem of theodicy, since the attributes of this entity no longer include absolute eternity and necessity (Meillassoux 2006b; 2008b; Harman 2011, 187-93, 207-21).\n\nIn conclusion, we may say that the contemporary philosophical overcoming of ontotheology, for which the divinity is an always already present (actual and substantial, absolute and necessary) entity, has left us with the fundamental figure of a non-present and purely futural god. The hermeneutical approach basically insisted on conceiving this god-to-come as a dimension of purely potential futurity, as an ultimate sensegranting purpose whose sole form of presence is that of an indication, hint, or trace pointing to a fundamental absence. However, the recent speculative developments of contemporary materialism have, rather surprisingly, resuscitated a genuinely messianic notion of a divine'advent,' of the possible cominginto-presence of the divine in a purely contingent and virtual, unmotivated and unpredictable, but nonetheless concrete and intratemporal, event, which nevertheless can bestow a purpose and dimension to the present situation in the form of an unfounded but rationally legitimate hope. It is to be expected that Meillassoux's forthcoming works and their philosophical reception will determine whether the'strong correlationist' phase in philosophical approaches to theology is truly giving way to a new, non-ontotheological rationalism.\n\n## NOTES\n\n1 In his Z√ºrich seminar, Heidegger (2005, 436-37) replies to a question concerning the identity of being and God: 'Being [ Sein ] and god are not identical, and I would never attempt to think the essence [ Wesen ] of god through being. [‚Ä¶] Were I yet to write a theology, as I am sometimes tempted to do, the word'being' should not occur in it. [‚Ä¶] I believe that being can never be thought as the ground and essence of god, but that the experience of god and its manifestness (insofar as it is encountered by the human being)\n\nnonetheless takes place [ sich ereignet ] in the direction of being, which never means that being could be a possible predicate of god.' That Heidegger makes this statement in 1951 implies that he does not yet qualify the draft on the'ultimate god' in Contributions to Philosophy as a'theology' in the strict sense.\n\n- 2 Among the most elaborate and thorough discussions of Heidegger's notion of ontotheology are Thomson 2005 and 2010. - 3 See, e.g., Heidegger 1983, 65-67; 1988a, 29; 1990, 17; 1992b, 14; 1993a, 206, 286, 307; 1995a, 42-44; 1997a, 37-38; 2006a, 60-61; 2008a, 168, 215, 227. - 4 On this reading of Descartes, see, e.g., Heidegger 1989, 212-13; 1996, 42930; 1998b, 112-71, 391-97, 410-13; 1998d, 325; 1999, 148-49; 2000b, 69-72, 82-83; 2002c, 66, 74-76, 81-84; 2003a, 87-88, 98-99; 2003b, 87, 98-100, 10611; 2012, 166-67. - 5 On the unity of transcendental apperception in Kant, see Heidegger 1988a, 125-29, 142-47; 1996, 458-63; 1997a, 177-182, 201-209; 1997c, 55-59; 1998a, 78-84; 1998c, 419-420; 1998d, 347-50; 2003a, 57-58. - 6 On this reading of Nietzsche, see, e.g., Heidegger 1991a, 3-6; 1991b, 198208; 1991c, 3-9, 150-251; 1991d, 147-96; 1998b, 1-4, 415-32, 585-94; 1998c, 1-22, 177-229, 231-361; 2000b, 77-86, 97-122; 2002c, 157-99; 2003a, 93102; 2003b, 209-67. - 7 On the'other onset,' see, e.g., Heidegger 1989, 4-6, 55, 57-60, 167-224; 1992a, 124-25, 184-90; 1994a, 108-09, 158-66; 1999, 3-5, 38, 40-42, 117-57; 2012, 6-8, 44, 46-48, 133-77. - 8 For one of the most illuminating discussions of the Heideggerian'ultimate god,' see Greisch 2000; 2008. - 9 I adopt here the rendering of Seyn as'beyng,' employed in the more recent Rojcewicz-Vallega-Neu translation of Contributions (instead of'be-ing' in the Emad-Maly translation). The Early Modern English orthography'beyng' has the advantage of being functionally similar, as an archaic and obsolete spelling of'being,' to the German Seyn (still in use in the early 19 th century). - 10 In Verse VIII of The Rhine, H√∂lderlin (1951, 152) writes: '[‚Ä¶] if there is anything / that the celestial ones require [ bed√ºrfen ], / it is heroes and humans / and other mortals. For since / the most blissful ones [ Seligsten ] feel nothing by themselves, / there must [‚Ä¶] be another who partakes / in the names of the gods and feels. / That is the one they need [ brauchen ] [...].' Heidegger (1980, 269) comments: 'With this Verse VIII the poet's thinking ascends one of the most protruding and solitary peaks of Western thinking, and that is to say, at the same time: of beyng [ Seyns ].' - 11 In his Logics of Worlds (2006), Badiou provocatively maintains that '[t]he critical machinery he [Kant] set up has enduringly poisoned philosophy [‚Ä¶]. Kant is the inventor of the disastrous theme of our'finitude' [‚Ä¶].' (Badiou 2006b, 561; 2009, 535) - 12 This is the sense in which infinity is attributed to God by Thomas Aquinas ( Summa theologiae Ia q7 a1).\n\n13 Beistegui (2005, 45) aptly summarizes Badiou's philosophical project as an attempt to free thought from the double horizon of unicity (ontology) and transcendence (theology).\n\n- 14 On the ambiguities inherent in Badiou's relationship to theology, see Clemens and Roffe 2008; Depoortere 2009; Phelps 2013. One of the only studies that also discusses Meillassoux's relationship to theology is Watkin 2011. - 15 On Meillassoux's'argument from mortality,' see my article'Transcendental Idealism and Strong Correlationism: Meillassoux and the End of Heideggerian Finitude,' forthcoming in Phenomenology and the Transcendental, edited by Sara Hein√§maa, Mirja Hartimo, and Timo Miettinen (London: Routledge). - 16 For some of the few existing commentaries on Meillassoux's notion of the divine, see Harman 2011, 90-122; Johnston 2011; Watkin 2011, 132-67. - 17 On the distinction between potentiality and virtuality, see Meillassoux 2006c; 2011b.\n\n## REFERENCES\n\nAristotle. 1924.

The central contention is that human creativity is especially capable of helping us connect to others in a valuable way, but the widespread availability of generative AI models reduces our incentives to engage in various sorts of creative work in the arts and sciences. I argue that creative endeavors must be motivated by curiosity, and so they must disclose the creative agent√ïs inquisitive self. It is through self-disclosure, including the disclosure of the inquisitive self, that we put ourselves in a position to be seen by and connect with others through our creative pursuits. Because relying on AI for certain generative tasks is less self-disclosive than the creative work such technologies supplant, this reliance threatens to weaken our connections to one another.\n\n## 0. Introduction 1\n\nThis essay is motivated by two questions. The first is: Does the widespread availability of generative artificial intelligence (AI) models pose a threat to human creativity? Versions of this question have quickly appeared in the headlines of editorials, blog posts, and all manner of think pieces following the public release of impressive AI applications like Midjourney and ChatGPT. 2 With good reason, the focus of the concern tends to be on practical questions about the employment prospects for creative professionals in the age of AI. But in this essay, I would like to suggest another sense in which AI poses a threat to creativity. This sort of threat is subtler, but equally profound.\n\nThe subtle threat I have in mind here can be captured with an analogy. It is akin to the threat my smart phone poses to my attention span. Although possible, maintaining a healthy attention span while regularly using my smart phone is a challenge. This is because it is easy to develop habits of smart-phone engagement that negatively affect my attention span. When I get into these bad habits √ê like leaving my notifications on and\n\n1 I am grateful to Ryan Davis, Jordan MacKenzie, and Keshav Singh, as well as audiences at the 25th World Congress of Philosophy at Sapienza University of Rome and the Philosophy, Politics, and Economics at the Frontier Workshop at the University of Buffalo for helpful conversations and feedback on earlier versions of this article.\n\n2 For some illustrative examples, see Clarke (2023), De Cremer et al (2023), Ellis (2024), and Uzzi (2023).\n\nchecking my phone constantly √ê I find it harder to do things that require sustained focus, like closely reading complex philosophical texts. In this way, my smart phone poses a threat to something I value. This is the notion of √íthreat√ì I have in mind in considering whether AI poses a threat to human creativity.\n\nThe second question motivating this essay is: If AI poses this sort of threat to human creativity, would that be a bad thing? If it would, there must be some value of human creativity that is not secured by reliance on AI. 3\n\nNote that answering the first question is at least partly an empirical matter. Part of the task of answering it will involve gathering data about how people engage with generative AI models and what effects this engagement has on their behaviors. But it is also partly a philosophical matter. Key terms √ê especially √ícreativity√ì √ê stand in need of philosophical analysis to make it clear how empirical evidence would bear on the question. The second question is a more straightforwardly philosophical. It is a question about the value of human creativity and whether that value would be lost in a world in which human creativity dwindled due to reliance on AI. In this essay, I will bring philosophical work on creativity to bear on the first question, arguing that the concern it raises is reasonable. I will then argue that there is at least one reason to think the answer to the second question is √íyes.√ì That is, I will argue for one respect in which AI posing a threat to human creativity would be a bad outcome.\n\nMy central contention is that, insofar as the widespread availability of AI models threatens human creativity, it threatens our ability to connect with other humans. As I will show, this is true with respect to both artistic and scientific creativity. Notably, I will not argue that this is the only or the most important potential negative outcome of humans becoming less creative in the age of AI. However, both popular and scholarly discourse on the matter suggests that this is one of the least acknowledged potential pitfalls. Philosophers working on creativity have, by and large, overlooked the important role human creativity plays in enabling us to make valuable connections with each other. For this reason, their accounts of creativity√ïs value do not make it obvious that a threat to creativity is a threat to human connection. In this paper, I aim to correct this oversight.\n\nBefore I begin constructing my argument, allow me to make the significance of the two motivating questions more vivid with an anecdote. For a recent philosophical outreach project, I led three groups of approximately twenty third-grade girls in a guided discussion about art and artificial intelligence. 4 I first asked the students to share why they enjoy making art. Their responses were endearing and mostly unsurprising. They included the following: making art helps them express their feelings and ideas, they like\n\n3 It is important to note that this is consistent with some of what is valuable about creativity being secured by reliance on AI. I am grateful to an anonymous reviewer for suggesting that I make this clarification.\n\n4 This outreach project was part of the Girls Engaged in Math and Science Exposition at Berry Middle School in Hoover, Alabama, USA. This event took place on February 8, 2024.\n\nto use their imagination, they like to play with colors and shapes, they like to draw and paint the things they love, they like to make gifts for people, and they simply find it fun.\n\nI then introduced the topic of AI image-generators. Most of the students had not yet been exposed to this technology, so I demonstrated by prompting Dall-E 2 with text and showing them the resultant images. I asked for volunteers to give me prompts and received ideas like √íorange cat in a green tree,√ì √ískateboarding elephant,√ì and √íschool bus monkey.√ì I encouraged them to add style suggestions, like √íin the style of cubism√ì or √íin the style of comic book illustration,√ì and the results delighted them.\n\nTheir reaction to Dall-E was overwhelmingly positive. I asked them whether they preferred making art by hand with their conventional art supplies or generating images with Dall-E. With nearly univocal enthusiasm, they told me they prefer the latter. Why? Their reasons included: √íIt√ïs faster√ì, √íIt looks cool,√ì √íIt√ïs better than what I can draw,√ì and √íI wouldn√ït have thought of doing it that way.√ì I asked them whether they would ever still choose to draw and paint if they could use Dall-E instead, and most said no.\n\nThis response concerned me. But is there really anything to be concerned about here? Certainly, there can be creativity involved in prompting image-generating AI models. 5 Indeed, some of the students√ï prompts were somewhat creative, although they were generally quite simple. On a view I have defended (Brainard, 2023), the sort of image-generating work these third-graders engaged in by prompting Dall-E was much less creative than what they described themselves doing when I asked them to tell me about their prior artistic practices. That is, these instances of prompting involved less creativity than the students would likely employ if they tried to draw or paint the things they told Dall-E to depict.\n\nThis anecdote raises the question: Would something of value be lost if children stopped drawing and painting and instead spent their time prompting generative AI? This is an instance of my second motivating question. To clarify, my concern is not about whether there is something intrinsically important about drawing and painting. Perhaps there is. But the concern that motivates me here is broader. My concern is about what might happen if humans make a habit of trading in our creative projects for much less creative ones. Would it be bad for humans to become less creative in the age of AI?\n\nIn Section 1, I introduce the concept of creative obsolescence and argue that there is good reason to suspect that AI may make human creativity obsolete in various aspects of our lives. In Section 2, I provide the first part of my argument for the claim that creative obsolescence would be a bad thing. I argue that one underappreciated value of creativity is that it plays an important role in connecting us to others, and I illustrate this with examples from both artistic creativity and scientific creativity. Finally, in Section 3, I argue that the social value of creativity can easily be lost if humans outsource their\n\n5 See, for instance, Charlie Engman√ïs work with Midjourney (Wiley, 2023).\n\ncreative projects to AI. In support of this claim, I present examples from both art and science in which human connection is impeded by relying on AI in a way that diminishes the human creativity involved in a project.\n\n## 1. The Threat of Creative Obsolescence\n\nIn this section, I will argue that there is reason to think AI may make human creativity obsolete, at least in some parts of our lives. To do so, I need to clarify what I mean by both √ícreativity√ì and √íobsolete.√ì\n\nLet√ïs start with the notion of creativity. In other work, I have argued that creativity is a form of successful exploration. By that, I mean it is a kind of non-formulaic process that necessarily involves agency, subjective novelty, and epistemic value (forthcoming). I further argue both that the kind of agency required for creativity necessarily involves selfdisclosure (a term I will explain in *Section 2*) and that creativity is essentially motivated by curiosity (2023). Finally, I argue that contemporary AI models are not themselves creative because they lack both curiosity and the relevant kind of self-disclosive agency (2023). 6 I will take these claims for granted in the discussion that follows.\n\nWhat do I mean by √íobsolete√ì? It is important to note that the term √íobsolete√ì has both a descriptive meaning and a normative meaning. 7 Something is descriptively obsolete just in case it is no longer used. For example, the Puritan practice of branding those convicted of crimes with letters denoting the nature of their crimes has long been obsolete. It is obsolete at least in part because of changing social views about the importance of public shaming. So, the question of whether AI will make human creatively descriptively obsolete is: Will it become the case that people abandon human creativity√ë in whole or in part √ê in favor of using AI to get what they want? This is largely an empirical question, at least once we√ïve settled what we mean by √ícreativity.√ì\n\nThe normative meaning of √íobsolete√ì on the other hand, is that something no longer has value because its value can be secured by something else that is otherwise preferable. Lead pipes are obsolete in this sense. The value they once had can be fully secured by safer alternatives. So, the question of whether AI will make human creativity normatively obsolete is: Will human creativity retain its value in the age of AI?\n\nLike the descriptive question, the normative question is partly empirical and partly philosophical. What generative capacities AI will develop √ê and therefore what sort of value it will be able to secure √ê is an empirical matter. What makes human creativity\n\n6 For further discussion of whether AI models can be genuinely creative see Chen (2020), Halina (2021), Langland-Hassan (forthcoming), and Paul and Stokes (2024).\n\n7 I am grateful to Keshav Singh for calling this distinction to my attention.\n\nvaluable is, at least partly, a philosophical question. The primary goal of this paper is to make some headway on answering the normative question. This is the focus of sections 2 and 3. But the fact that the answer to the descriptive question may be affirmative is what makes the normative question important and urgent.\n\nHow could AI make human creativity descriptively obsolete? Note that even though current AI models are not genuinely creative (on my view), they can produce outputs that are valuable in many of the same ways that the products of genuine creativity are often valuable. Human creativity is often prized for its products. Among other things, our creative achievements have given us powerful art, successful scientific theories, and solutions to complex problems. Thus, creativity is valuable at least insofar as it yields products of aesthetic, scientific, and practical value. 8\n\nIt is striking that contemporary AI models can also produce outputs with the same sorts of value. That is, they can generate products that are aesthetically, scientifically, and practically valuable. AI models have produced images humans find beautiful and jokes humans find funny. 9 Scientists are using AI models to identify candidate drugs that could be used to treat diseases and other ailments. 10 And the practical value of AI is undeniable. Since ChatGPT became publicly available in 2022, users have used it for help with mealplanning, efficiently navigating archives, learning new languages, fixing bugs in code, and appealing insurance claims, among many other tasks. 11\n\nIn all these cases, a major selling point for using AI rather than relying on human effort is that it is quick, efficient, and inexpensive (for the user). By contrast, human creative work is often arduous, time-consuming, and resource intensive. If we can get the benefits of creative work without the costs, perhaps creativity can be made normatively obsolete. I am now in a better position to articulate the normative question of creative obsolescence: If we come to rely on AI models instead of our own creativity, will anything of value be lost? In other words, does human creativity have any value that cannot be secured more quickly and economically by relying on generative AI?\n\n8 The question of whether all instances of creativity are valuable is disputed. Alison Hills and Alexander Bird (2018, 2019) offer an influential argument that creativity is not necessarily valuable. While I have challenged this claim (forthcoming), the generic claim about creativity√ïs value I am making here is consistent with the view advanced by Hills and Bird. That is, by suggesting that creativity has aesthetic, scientific, and practical value, I do not mean to suggest that every instance of creativity has one or more of these forms of value. Rather, I mean to suggest that when instances of creativity are praised, it tends to be because they yield such value.\n\n9 One notable image is Th≈Ω‚Ä∞tre D√ïop≈Ωra Spatial by Jason Allen, which won a prize at the 2022 Colorado State Fair (Roose 2022). For examples of humorous AI-generated headlines in the style of The Onion, see Rich (2023).\n\n10 For a discussion of how AI models are used to aid in drug design, see Mazuz et al (2023). For potential applications for AI in scientific discovery, see Brumfiel (2023).\n\n11 See Paris and Buchanan (2023).\n\nThis normative question is important and urgent. If creativity has some value that cannot be secured by AI, and yet AI√ïs widespread availability is a threat to our creativity (in the same way that my smart phone is a threat to my attention span), then we may lose that value √ê whatever it is √ê without realizing it. In Sections 2 and 3, I will argue that one thing we care about √ê our connection to others √ê is in danger of being weakened by overreliance on AI in place of creative pursuits.\n\nBefore moving on, a clarification is in order. Full-blown descriptive creative obsolescence is not the only scenario of concern. Perhaps we will still find ourselves mobilizing our creativity in some aspects of our lives, regardless of what AI advances await us. To return to my analogy from before, I still retain some measure of attention span even when I find myself in the throes of my most detrimental smart phone habits. But that doesn√ït mean nothing of value has been lost. As I will argue in *section 3*, if the role of creativity in our lives diminishes significantly, we are in danger of sustaining significant losses in our ability to connect with one another.\n\n## 2. How Creativity Connects Us\n\nThe first step in answering the normative problem of creative obsolescence is to shed light on a benefit of creativity that has been largely overlooked in the philosophical literature. This is the role that creativity plays in enabling human connection. While it will be easiest to illustrate this point with respect to creativity in the arts, I will argue that it is also true of creativity in the sciences.\n\nAs I noted in the previous section, I have argued in other work that creativity involves self-disclosure (2023). It will be necessary to elaborate on this point here. I follow Gary Watson (1996) in using the term to refer to something that happens when we exercise our agency in ways that give us a kind of ownership over our actions. Watson invokes the concept of self-disclosure to characterize his notion of attributability, a kind of non-moral responsibility we have for our actions. On his usage, what I do is attributable to me when it subjects me to appraisal as an adopter of ends. And for this to be true, what I do must disclose who I am, in some sense. Specifically, Watson argues that it must disclose something about what I stand for, what I value, or what I am committed to. He explains:\n\n√âif what I do flows from my values and ends, there is a stronger sense in which my activities are inescapably my own: I am committed to them. As declarations of my adopted ends, they express what I√ïm about, my identity as an agent. (1996, p. 233)\n\nWhy think that our creativity is self-disclosive in this way? As Elliot Samuel Paul and Dustin Stokes (2018) have argued, creativity is a praise concept. We praise individuals for\n\ntheir creative achievements, and this sort of praise is only fitting insofar as they are responsible for what they have done, in some sense. If we are responsible for our creativity in at least the minimal sense captured by Watson√ïs notion of attributability, then our creative achievements disclose information about who we are as agents. What I do creatively discloses information about how I see the world, what I care about, what I believe, how I pursue my goals, and so on. 12\n\nAs I noted in the previous section, I have argued elsewhere that creativity necessarily involves curiosity (2023). In general terms, I understand curiosity as the motivation to pursue epistemic goods like knowledge and understanding. Because creativity is a kind of exploration motivated by curiosity (on my account), our creative pursuits disclose information about our inquisitive selves. I borrow this term from Christen at al, (2014), who use it to refer to the aspect of a person that seeks new information.\n\nTo get a feel for what an inquisitive self is and how someone√ïs creative work might disclose this aspect of who they are, it helps to think of especially creative individuals whose creativity you admire. In my own field, I admire the work of creative philosophers like David Lewis and Iris Murdoch for the questions they ask and the ways they go about pursuing answers. In their creative philosophical explorations, such thinkers reveal what they wish to understand, what ideas they think are worth highlighting and scrutinizing along the way, and what sorts of insights they take to constitute answers to their motivating questions. The character of their creative work reveals not only what knowledge or understanding they wish to gain but also why they wish to gain it. In this way, their creativity discloses information about who they are as inquirers.\n\nBecause philosophy is a discipline in which questions and processes of inquiry are generally made quite explicit, it is perhaps easy to see how one√ïs inquisitive self is on display in a creative philosophical project. But creative artists also disclose their inquisitive selves in their work. Consider the following remarks from prolific textile artist Bisa Butler about her creative process. Here, she describes how she studies each photograph that serves as the inspiration for one of her vibrant portrait quilts:\n\nI√ïm learning things about this person by studying their image carefully. How is their head tilted? How do they hold their hands? I√ïm trying to use all these clues to give me insight [about] what their inner self was like. (Scholastic, 2023a)\n\nAs Butler√ïs remarks reveal, her creative process is driven by a desire to understand the subjects of her art. And the character of this inquiry into her subject√ïs inner lives is\n\n12 The notion of self-disclosure may be useful for explicating the notion of √íflair√ì that plays a central role in Gaut√ïs (2003) account of creativity.\n\ndisclosed in her artwork. It may not be as easy to discern precisely what curiosity drives her art as it is with creative philosophical texts, but an appropriately attuned observer of Butler√ïs art has the opportunity to discover something about who she is as an inquirer √ê her inquisitive self √ê by studying her work. On my view, because of the motivating role curiosity plays in creativity, all instances of creativity disclose an agent√ïs inquisitive self, at least to some extent.\n\nIt is this self-disclosive nature of creativity that accounts for creativity√ïs role in enabling human connection. The notion of √íconnection√ì I have in mind here is quite broad. It encompasses both interpersonal relationships and a variety of other cases in which someone comes to understand someone else√ïs ideas, experiences, or values. I will begin by considering how creativity enables connection in interpersonal relationships. I have in mind relationships among friends, family members, coworkers, romantic partners, and so on √ê relationships involving mutual acknowledgement and interaction.\n\nTo have meaningful interpersonal relationships, we must get to know each other. I take this claim to be reasonably well supported by common intuition, but there is also plenty of philosophical support for the idea. Consider, for instance, Iris Murdoch√ïs (1970) view of loving attention, which involves striving to see someone accurately and justly. In a similar vein, David Velleman (1999). conceives of love as an √íarresting awareness√ì of a particular person√ïs value. More recently, Jordan Mackenzie argues that being in a loving relationship requires both that we desire to know the person we are in a relationship with and that we are obligated to act on that desire (2018). And Daniela Dover (forthcoming) argues that loving someone involves an inexhaustible curiosity about their thoughts, feelings, and experiences. These are all accounts of love, but they are capacious. They are not restricted to romantic love. Rather, they accommodate a wide array of cases in which we lovingly care about someone.\n\nRelationships cannot be formed in the manner these views describe without selfdisclosure. If a person keeps their cards very close to their chest at all times, try as you might, you cannot afford them loving attention in Murdoch√ïs sense because you are prevented from perceiving them accurately. You cannot have an arresting awareness of someone√ïs rational nature, as Velleman suggests, unless they let you see their reasons and their ends. If we are obligated to act on our desire to know the person we love, as MacKenzie argues, their failure to self-disclose would put us in an untenable position. Even the sort of curiosity that Dover describes would be hindered in such a case because it involves an interminable stream of learning more about someone and becoming more curious about what has been learned. That process cannot get very far if nothing about the other person is revealed to you.\n\nSo far, I have argued that self-disclosure is essential for forming meaningful interpersonal relationships with others. However, it is not only in these relationships that self-disclosure enables valuable social connections. Importantly, self-disclosure is also\n\nvaluable for a general sense of connection we can experience even with people we do not know personally. This often occurs when we encounter a work of art that represents something we personally relate to. For instance, if I relate to a sentiment captured by a line of poetry, I may feel a connection to the poet through a recognition of our shared experience.\n\nThis sort of connection also occurs when an artist helps their audience learn about something they cannot relate to personally. Consider the following further remarks from Bisa Butler, this time reflecting on how her portraits can be illuminating for those outside the Black community:\n\nMy work highlights the Black experience because it√ïs a recording of what life is like for me as a Black woman and the way I see things. So, by me creating these portraits, I√ïm giving other people a window into: How do Black people see themselves? And how do they want to be portrayed? How do they want to be remembered? How do they want to be recorded in history? (Scholastic, 2023b)\n\nHere, Butler captures the sense in which the self-disclosure inherent in creative work makes it possible for an audience to connect with the artist, in a sense, even while not knowing them personally or having a shared experience. No relationship is formed in this sort of case, but there is social value in coming to recognize something about someone else√ïs experience.\n\nI have now argued that self-disclosure is essential for social connection, broadly construed. I have also argued that creativity involves self-disclosure. I have not yet identified what makes the self-disclosure inherent in creativity to be especially valuable. We can, of course, disclose information about ourselves in uncreative ways. You could learn a lot about me if you interviewed me, as long as I answered your questions honestly, even if I did not answer them creatively. So, creativity is not necessary for self-disclosure. But why is creativity nevertheless especially valuable for human connection?\n\nFirst of all, recall my contention that creativity discloses the inquisitive self. This is not the only aspect of ourselves that creativity can disclose, but it is an aspect of us that is always disclosed, to some degree, by our creativity. The inquisitive self is a particularly important aspect of a person to get to know if you wish to form a meaningful connection with them. In particular, it is important to understand someone√ïs inquisitive self if you want to understand their perspective. This includes their beliefs and the network of dependencies between those beliefs. It also includes which questions they take to be open and closed, the reasons that certain questions are of particular interest to them, and their motivation to seek answers to those questions.\n\nFor example, one of my colleagues is philosophically interested in the concept of forgiveness. Because I know about her interest, when she asks a question in the Q&amp;A following a talk on the topic, I understand the significance of her question relative to the broader questions she has been pondering. I also know something about what hangs on the speaker√ïs answer, from her perspective. I can better understand the significance of her philosophical ideas and questions because I know her as an inquirer. I know what she is curious about, and I know something about what it might take to satisfy her curiosity. I am therefore able to have far more interesting and fruitful conversations with her. In this way, my understanding of who she is as an inquirer improves our interpersonal connection.\n\nOf course, it is not only through our creativity that we can disclose our inquisitive selves. My colleague could, at least in principle, convey all this information about her philosophical perspective by describing her interests to me in detail. But I would like to suggest that creativity is especially disclosive of the inquisitive self, both in how much is information is disclosed and how reliably accurate the information is.\n\nImagine that I tell you I am interested in baking pies. You may believe me, but I could of course be lying, self-deceived, merely aspirational, exaggerating to fit in socially, or otherwise insincere. Imagine instead that I show you a creative project I have been working on √ê an experimental cookbook in which I develop original recipes for pies based on the state fruit for each of the fifty United States. In doing so, I present you with much more √ê and more conclusive √ê information about the depth and character of my interest in baking pies. By examining my creative project, you are in a position to understand what sort of flavor combinations intrigue me, which baking conventions I adhere to (and which I flout), which features of a pie I find most valuable, what possibilities I am most curious about, and what exploratory paths my curiosity has led me down.\n\nBecause creativity is driven by our curiosity, our creative pursuits demonstrate who we are as inquirers in an especially transparent way. As I mentioned before, genuine curiosity is motivating. Lani Watson (2018) illustrates this idea with the example of a student who assures their professor they are curious about a topic covered in class, but then declines the opportunity to learn more about the topic (at no cost or inconvenience to themself). By showing no motivation to learn more about the topic, the student reveals that their self-ascription of curiosity was false. Had the student instead explored the topic in some creative project, they would have vindicated their claim to curiosity. Thus, when it comes to the inquisitive self, creative work is much more revelatory than simple selfreporting. The proof of the curiosity is in the creativity, so to speak. Our (creative) actions speak louder than our words (about who we are as inquirers).\n\nOne might worry that what I have said about how creativity enables connection does not generalize to all the domains in which AI threatens to make creativity obsolete\n\nthat I discussed in the last section. So, before moving on, it is important to discuss how creativity enables connection in the sciences as well.\n\nOne dissimilarity between art and science is that, whereas most (perhaps all) art must be creative if it is to be good, the same is not true of work in the sciences. A lot of important scientific work is not creative, and it should not strive to be. For good reason, scientists must often follow strict protocol rather than taking creative risks in their work. But philosophers of science have long acknowledged that some critical parts of the scientific process do require creativity. As Carl Hempel (1966) famously argued, hypothesis generation requires creativity because theories cannot be derived directly from observable facts. A scientific theorist must devise a hypothesis to account for the data before any attempts as confirmation or disconfirmation can occur, and coming up with a hypothesis requires creativity.\n\nWhile less obviously so than artistic creativity, scientific creativity is also selfdisclosive in a way that enables human connection. Of course, the felt experience of this connection will typically differ greatly from the felt experience of connection via artistic creativity. But there is a general sense in which we connect with another person when we are able to grasp a complex idea they are offering. When one scientist studies another scientist√ïs analogical diagram of a phenomenon and thereby grasps the theory that is being proposed, there is a sense in which their understanding results from a connection they have made with the scientist who authored the diagram. Popular euphemisms for this, such as √íI√ïm picking up what you√ïre putting down,√ì highlight the sense in which achieving understanding of what someone is striving to communicate is a valuable sort of social connection. And notably, if Longino (1990) is right that scientific knowledge is inescapably social in character, this sort of connection may be critical for there to be any scientific knowledge at all.\n\nTo illustrate this point, consider James Clerk Maxwell√ïs (1861) famous diagrams of the electromagnetic field as an arrangement of simple machines. 13 These diagrams depict gears, cogs, and idle wheels, arranged in such a way that they could account for the appearance of action-at-a-distance that we observe in cases of electricity and magnetism (like an iron filing moving in a particular direction when positioned near a magnet). The aim of these highly creative diagrams was to demonstrate that something playing the role of an electromagnetic field was possible, even though Maxwell was clearly not suggesting that it was actually comprised of the simple machines that featured in his drawings. His theorizing demonstrated that the existence of something playing this role was a possibility in that it was consistent with accepted beliefs about the laws of physics.\n\nWhen other scientists encountered this creative theorizing, they had an opportunity to learn something valuable. To do so, they had to get on Maxwell√ïs wavelength, so to\n\n13 For a detailed explanation of this case, see Simpson (1997).\n\nspeak. And Maxwell√ïs creativity made this connection possible. His creative presentation of these ideas disclosed information about his inquisitive self: what he was trying to figure out, what his background beliefs were, what questions he treated as open, and so on. This information was needed for other scientists to apprehend the insight. If someone thought he was trying to propose a theory of how the electromagnetic field actually works, they would miss out on the value of his work. But because scientists were able to understand his explanation through exposure to his creative work, they were able to connect in the way required to advance scientific understanding. 14\n\n## 3. The Precarity of Human Connection\n\nI have argued both that the widespread availability of generative AI poses a threat to human creativity and that an underappreciated benefit of our creativity is the role it plays in connecting us to one another. In the final part of this paper, I examine how employing generative AI in place of our creative pursuits affects our prospects for social connection. First, I consider a simple instance of relying on an AI image generator rather than engaging in conventional artistic techniques like drawing or painting. Second, I consider a case in which AI has led to a breakthrough in the science of protein folding. Each case reveals a way in which the prospects for human connection can be diminished by reliance on AI rather than human creativity. This does not mean that we should forego AI in these cases. Particularly in the scientific case, the value of AI√ïs contribution is undeniable. But it does mean that we should take care to preserve a role for human creativity in the arts and sciences so that the important social connection creativity has long fostered in these domains is not lost in the age of AI. 15\n\nI woke up one morning thinking about how much my dog Frisbee resembles a cloud. He is large, white, and fluffy. When he is sleeping, his placid demeanor together with the hint of a smile that is always on his face evokes in my mind the same cheerful serenity I associate with a cumulus cloud in a bright blue sky. I wanted to realize this association visually. I have, in the past, enjoyed drawing when ideas like this arose. But nowadays, I have access to image-generating AI models.\n\nI took to Dall-E 2 and typed out the prompt: √ía sleeping Samoyed that is also a fluffy cloud in a blue sky in the style of impressionist art.√ì Dall-E returned the following four images (see figure 1) within a few seconds:\n\n14 See Brainard (2020) for an account according to which a successful how-possibly explanation succeeds by relieving an imaginative frustration on the part of its recipient.\n\n15 An anonymous reviewer has noted the possibility that future AI may supply other means of achieving equally valuable forms of human connection (without the need for human creativity). If this happens, it would challenge the contention that descriptive creative obsolescence would be a bad thing. At present, I am unaware of any reason to think this is likely.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFigure 1: Four close-up images of a flu4y white Samoyed dog lying on the ground with a blue sky in the background. The images are all in the style of impressionist art.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI liked the first image, so I saved it, shared it with friends, and made it the desktop background on my computer. Has anything gone wrong here? I had an idea, used AI to generate an image of that idea, and enjoyed the pleasant experience of appreciating an image I found to be aesthetically valuable. It was a seamless and positive experience. None of this seems obviously problematic.\n\nWas this a case of creativity? As I mentioned out the outset, relying on artificial intelligence does not entirely preclude human creativity. The prompt I devised was everso-slightly creative, though not especially so. Likening a Samoyed to a cloud is hardly a novel idea, and choosing impressionism as a style to depict clouds is likewise quite banal. But I did think of it on my own, and it was motivated by my curiosity about how Frisbee√ïs cloud-likeness could be conveyed in an image. It meets the conditions of my account of creativity to a very minimal degree, so it counts as minimally creative.\n\nCertainly, the image Dall-E generated does not disclose nearly as much about me as an image I drew myself would have. This image discloses that I appreciate sleeping Samoyeds aesthetically and that I imagine them like clouds. But that is not especially illuminating. If I had instead expended artistic effort to capture my idea, you would know how fluffy Samoyeds are in my whimsical imaginings of them (there is, after all, quite a range of Samoyed fluffiness). I would have made the curvature of the mouth more pronounced so that the dog appeared more obviously to be smiling, drawing attention to a feature I wished to explore aesthetically. Ultimately, a viewer of this image ends up with very little insight into how I see Samoyeds and what interests me about them.\n\nA viewer might even be misled by the elements that do not accord with my intentions for the image. For instance, I prompted Dall-E to put the Samoyed-cloud in the sky. But in all four images, the Samoyed-cloud appears on the ground. No doubt, this is because of the model√ïs training data. The internet is full of photos of Samoyeds lying on the ground. It is not full of images of Samoyeds floating in the sky. But the fact that the image was not exactly what I wanted did not stop me from accepting it and letting it end my aesthetic exploration. I decided that it was good enough, even though it did not accord\n\nclosely with my motivating idea. Thus, the resulting image I shared with my friends was not especially self-disclosive. It bore only a loose resemblance to the idea that inspired me to generate it.\n\nI take this anecdote to illustrate a kind of lazy reliance on artificial intelligence that I suspect many of us are (or will become) prone to. Where we might have otherwise put forth a significant degree of creative effort, we are tempted by instant gratification. In typical use cases such as this one, the input-output structure of an image-generating AI model means that that the amount of self-disclosure that occurs when a user prompts the model is bound to be curtailed by all the facets of the process that the user has nothing to do with (like what images happen to be in the model√ïs training data). The user discloses little about themselves, and the potential for connection is thereby diminished.\n\nOf course, not everyone who utilizes image-generating models does so in this simple way. Artists who employ AI often repeatedly prompt these models, tweaking, refining, curating, and incorporating additional training data as they work. As one instance, artist Charlie Engman reports working through up to three-hundred images a day with Midjourney (Wiley, 2023). For artists who exercise considerable creativity in prompting these models, the resulting images are likely to be much more self-disclosive than my Samoyed image. 16 Though the creativity of such artists may not be diminished by the availability of AI, the rest of us face a strong temptation to engage with this technology in the low-effort way my anecdote illustrates.\n\nThe idea that one can inhibit social connection by choosing ways of living that impede self-disclosure appears in Ralph Waldo Emerson√ïs essay Self-Reliance. Emerson was worried about a very different threat to self-disclosure √ê thoughtless conformity to religious creeds and other social norms of the day. 17 But his diagnosis of what is going wrong in such cases bears a striking similarity to my diagnosis of what is going wrong in these cases of overreliance on AI:\n\nThe objection to conforming to usages that have become dead to you is that it scatters your force. It loses your time and blurs the impression of your character√â under all these screens I have difficulty to detect the precise man you are: and of course so much force is withdrawn from your proper life. But do your work, and I shall know you. (1983, p. 263).\n\nEmerson paints a vivid and incisive picture. When I outsource my creative work to DallE, I am blurring the impression of my character. I am erecting a screen through which others will have difficulty detecting my aesthetic tastes and other aspects of my personality. Because I have not done much of the work myself, I have not generated a\n\n16 I am grateful to an anonymous reviewer for this point.\n\n17 For a thorough philosophical examination of Emerson√ïs opposition to creeds, see Davis (2018).\n\nproduct that enables others to know me, at least not well. Ryan Davis (forthcoming) helpfully explains the idea:\n\nWhen your choices are determined by something other than the exercise of your own capacities, they don√ït reveal anything about you. Emerson thought you could interact with someone a lot and yet remain a stranger to them, all because your interactions didn√ït really say anything about you in particular. (Forthcoming, p. 121-122)\n\nIf Emerson is right, becoming less creative in the age of AI increases our risk of remaining strangers to each other. The more we foreclose avenues for being seen by others, including pursuing creative projects, the more we subject ourselves to alienation and loneliness.\n\nIs there a related sense in which reliance on AI rather than human creativity in the sciences might also result in less social connection? I will briefly suggest one reason to think there is, though it is less straightforward than in the case of artistic creativity. Consider one of the most prominent success stories in AI-driven science: AlphaFold. AlphaFold is a deep learning model developed by Google DeepMind that has had unprecedented predictive success regarding the protein structures that sequences of amino acids will adopt when they fold. 18 Some scientists claim AlphaFold has solved the protein folding problem √ê the longstanding puzzle of how amino acid sequences determine folding structure. 19 In its tremendous predictive success, AlphaFold has produced something that human creative theorizing alone has not yet managed to achieve. This appears to be a valuable scientific breakthrough, one researchers are celebrating for its great practical promise, particularly concerning drug discovery. 20\n\nThe potential threat to human connection does not come directly from AlphaFold√ïs success, but rather from how that success may influence further scientific work. This success has been accompanied by many triumphant pronouncements that the protein folding problem has been solved. 21 But as biologists have long acknowledged, the predictive task is only part of the protein folding problem. 22 A remaining part of the puzzle that AlphaFold has not solved is the explanatory task: the task of enabling scientists to understand why particular amino acid sequences fold as they do. Chemist Derek Lowe (2024) writes: √í√âIf the protein folding problem was a task set for the human race by God to make us understand physics better, then we cheated our way to the answers instead.√ì I take Lowe√ïs remarks to reflect the idea that though AlphaFold produces useful results in the form of reliable predictions, it has not enabled the scientific community to understand the underlying mechanisms responsible for protein folding.\n\n18 See Abramson et al (2024) or an overview of AlphaFold√ïs success.\n\n19 See Anfinsen (1973) for an influential early presentation of the problem.\n\n20 Henshall (2024).\n\n21 See Lewis (2022) as one example.\n\n22 Dill et al (2008).\n\nPhilosophers of science have argued that genuine scientific explanations must provide answers to contrastive why-questions of the form √íwhy did this happen rather than that?√ì. 23 Famously, the functioning of deep-learning models like AlphaFold is opaque in a way that prevents these models from furnishing such answers. 24 Due to the black-box nature of deep learning models, AlphaFold cannot offer us insight into why it generates the predictions it does (rather than some other predictions). Unlike a human scientist who makes predictions on the basis of a theory about why a system functions as it does, AlphaFold cannot explain why it predicts that a particular protein folds in this shape rather than that shape. It helps us form expectations, but it does not help us understand why proteins fold as they do.\n\nWhat does help scientists understand the systems they investigate? Historically, it has been creative theorizing, combined with work by the scientific community to confirm or disconfirm those theories. Scientists develop theories that are comprehensible to other scientists, and as Hempel argued, doing so requires creativity (1966). By marshalling their creativity in this way, scientists make it possible for other scientists to pick up the thread, to seek confirmation of their theories, and to suggest modifications. This sort of connection is vital for the pursuit of scientific explanations. And it is only made possible by the creativity involved in the development of scientific theories.\n\nCreative theorizing thus enables the sharing of ideas among scientists. And this exchange of ideas is needed in order for the scientific community to explain why events in the natural world √ê such as the folding of proteins √ê transpire as they do. But scientists cannot have this sort of exchange with AlphaFold. A human mind cannot perform the computations AlphaFold performs, so we cannot connect to it in the way we connect to other humans. We cannot grasp what is going on with AlphaFold in the same way we can grasp the ideas of human scientists. We cannot get on AlphaFold√ïs wavelength. We cannot pick up what AlphaFold is putting down, so to speak.\n\nPhilosophers of science typically conceive of scientific progress as involving not only advances in predictive power, but also advances in theory. 25 Finnur Dells≈Ωn (2016), for instance, argues that scientific progress consists in increasing understanding. If this is right, then those who claim that the protein folding problem has been fully solved by AlphaFold √ê even though the model has not afforded the scientific community greater understanding of why proteins fold as they do √ê may be making a critical mistake. They are deeming a scientific inquiry complete when it has only achieved one of the dual aims of science. This mistake is indicative of a worrying tendency: the tendency to conceive of what generative AI can do as fully replacing the important role played by human creativity\n\n23 See for instance Lewis (1986).\n\n24 For a philosophical discussion of AI√ïs explainability problem, see Fleisher (2022).\n\n25 For an overview of account with this in this vein, see Dells≈Ωn (2018).\n\nin science. This tendency poses a threat to scientific creativity and consequently to the human connection via shared understanding of the natural world that creative scientific theorizing facilitates. The scientific community should be wary of adopting a conception of scientific progress that leaves out the importance of advancing this shared human understanding.\n\n## 4. Conclusion\n\nI have argued that letting ourselves become less creative in the age of AI poses a threat to our ability to connect with each other. The self-disclosure that occurs when we are creative makes it possible for others to understand us. This is essential for both our interpersonal relationships and a broader sense of human connection that includes the resonance of others√ï art and the apprehension of others√ï ideas. Because the temptation to outsource our creative work to AI is strong and growing stronger, it is imperative that we attend to the social value of creativity. Otherwise, we are in danger of developing a relationship with AI that leaves us much less connected to each other.\n\n## References\n\nAbramson, J., Adler, J., Dunger, J. et al (2024).

Cassirer-did) plausibly argue that it was absolute idealism -with its sweeping claims about the march of history, and its optimism about the increasingly rational self-unfolding of the Absolute-that

to collapse after World War I, neo-Kantianism might and perhaps should very well have come into its own, at least from a broadly philosophical point of view.\", \"type\": \"Claim\"}, \"ADU10\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"text\": \"One suggestion is flatfootedly institutional: There is a natural tendency on the part of any group of young philosophers (especially, it seems, young German

merits of these three explanatory suggestions, then, the wholesale collapse of institutional neo-Kantianism remains something of an historical mystery.\", \"type\": \"Claim\"}, \"ADU15\": {\"type\":

career, History and Class Consciousness (1923) is by far his best-known work.\", \"type\": \"Premise\"}, \"ADU17\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"text\": \"In it, Lukacs repeatedly criticizes Kant's philosophy as (in Hohendahl's words) 'the most radical and advanced consciousness of the early bourgeoisie'\", \"type\": \"Premise\"}, \"ADU18\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"text\": \"For Lukacs, the tension between these aspirations and limits somehow'reflects the limits of the new social order of the bourgeoisie'; indeed, he claims in one place that the entire tradition of critical philosophy'springs from the reified structure of consciousness,' and that it ends in a series of'Antinomies of Bourgeois Thought.'\", \"type\": \"Premise\"}, \"ADU19\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"text\": \"At this juncture, readers of Spinoza, Leibniz, and Wolff are likely to protest that the demands for rational understanding and system were already acutely manifested in 17th-century rationalism.\", \"type\": \"Premise\"}, \"ADU20\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"text\": \"Kant scholars, on the other hand, may complain about Lukacs' overemphasis on the'rationalist' aspect of the critical philosophy: after all, from the mid-1760s onward, Kant clearly opposes the unrestricted use of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, and also insists that pure reason is unable to rise to the'unconditioned' and provide a comprehensive account of mind and world.\", \"type\": \"Premise\"}, \"ADU21\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"text\": \"More striking, however, is the fact that Lukacs sometimes writes as though Kant himself was unaware of the tension between demand for systematic cognition and the self-imposed limits of critical reason, and that he thus ended up in the'Antinomies of Bourgeois Reason' despite himself.\", \"type\": \"Claim\"}, \"ADU22\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"text\": \"But while this charge may apply to some of the neo-Kantians, it is difficult to see how it could apply to Kant himself.\", \"type\": \"Premise\"}, \"ADU23\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"text\": \"Kant repeatedly expresses not only his awareness of the limits of theoretical knowledge, but also his frustration with that fact and his nostalgia for something like epistemic acquaintance with the whole.\", \"type\": \"Premise\"}, \"ADU24\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"text\": \"Kant's own response to the antinomies, of course, is neither to give up (as Lukacs claims he did in History and Class Consciousness [p. 134]), nor to give in to the speculative urge, but rather to set knowledge aside and try to be content with mere'belief' (Glaube) about things-in-themselves.\", \"type\": \"Premise\"}, \"ADU25\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"text\": \"In other words, Kant claims that there is plenty for critical philosophers to say about the'unconditioned,' so long as we recognize that the status of our claims is that of hope, acceptance, or'firm rational belief,' rather than that of knowledge or cognition.\", \"type\": \"Premise\"}, \"ADU26\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"text\": \"Lukacs' criticism of Kant's moral philosophy likewise seems to stray somewhat from its stated target.\", \"type\":

freedom'\", \"type\": \"Premise\"}, \"ADU28\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"text\": \"Here he is presumably referring to the fact that the phenomenal laws, for Kant, govern the entirety of the empirical world-including the empirical human self.\", \"type\": \"Premise\"}, \"ADU29\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"text\": \"Neo-Kantians in both the Marburg and the Baden schools adopted this deterministic picture, but in keeping with their opposition to the thing-in-itself, they also jettisoned Kant's practical commitment to a substantive noumenal or transcendental freedom that is compatible with this phenomenal determinism.\", \"type\": \"Premise\"}, \"ADU30\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"text\": \"From the historical Kant's point of view, however, this is a serious misstep, for it is precisely in the hard-to-fathom agency of the transcendental self-the self that is insulated from all causal and economic determination-that the substantive freedom required for moral responsibility is located.\", \"type\": \"Premise\"}, \"ADU31\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"text\": \"Lukacs dismisses such talk of transcendental freedom as'empty' and'unable [...] to avoid the abyss of fatalism,' but there is no specification of precisely what in Kant's compatibilism he finds unworkable.\", \"type\": \"Premise\"}, \"ADU32\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"text\": \"Indeed, he appears to be opposed to the idea of compatibilism generally, noting that'the freedom (of the subject) is neither able to overcome the sensuous necessity of the system of knowledge and the soullessness of the fatalistically conceived laws of nature, nor is it able to give them any meaning.'\", \"type\": \"Premise\"}, \"ADU33\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"text\": \"But this is more stipulation than argument, and thus makes it tempting to say of Lukacs' critique what Hohendahl says of Max Horkheimer's: namely, that its aim'is not a reconstruction of the historical Kant or even an evaluation of relevant philosophical problems'\", \"type\": \"Premise\"}, \"ADU34\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"text\": \"Instead, Lukacs seems (at least in this book) to give in to the temptation to use Kant and other modern philosophers as stalking-horses for the (bourgeois) conception of the world and the self that he hopes to undermine.\", \"type\": \"Premise\"}, \"ADU35\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"text\": \"This is an acceptable rhetorical strategy, of course, but it is also useful for readers to consider whether such attacks really hit their stated target.\", \"type\": \"Premise\"}, \"ADU36\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"text\": \"The perceived unattractiveness of prominent neo-Kantian readings of Kant elicited more than just criticism; it also led some of the members of the interwar generation to call for a more painstaking historical and rational reconstruction of Kant's own views.\", \"type\": \"Claim\"}, \"ADU37\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"text\": \"Despite all the criticism, there was still a strong urge among some of them, anyway, to take on the mantle of the great Prussian philosopher.\", \"type\": \"Premise\"}, \"ADU38\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"text\": \"Thus, for example, Husserl ultimately adopted the label'transcendental idealism' for his own philosophy, and Heidegger's lengthy study of the first Critique was advertised as'the first, explicit ground-laying for metaphysics' of the sort that he himself aimed to continue.\", \"type\": \"Premise\"}, \"ADU39\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"text\": \"As a result of all this, by mid-century, the legacy of Kant had become both so contested and so crucial that a new generation of scholars saw the need for yet another movement back to Kant.\", \"type\": \"Claim\"}, \"ADU40\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"text\": \"Building on the careful textual, philological, and editorial work of various friends (if not exactly card-carrying members) of the neo-Kantian movement, such as Erich Adickes and Benno Erdmann, the generation that came into its own after World War II founded the vibrant traditions of historical Kant scholarship that are now flourishing across both Europe and the Americas.\", \"type\": \"Premise\"}, \"ADU41\": {\"type\":

INTRODUCTION\n\nPeter Hohendahl's paper provides an illuminating survey of some of the most important developments in German philosophy between the world wars. The fragmented and yet immensely creative character of this period is visible in the list of writers he considers: some recommended a return to Hegel (e.g., Sternberg), some moved in that direction but only as a stepping stone to a reappropriation of Marx (Luk√Ücs, Horkheimer), some remained within a broadly Kantian framework but advocated significant changes (Simmel, Husserl), many were drawn to an antimetaphysical positivism (Carnap), and still others inclined toward existentialism and a new ontology of'being' (Heidegger).\n\nDespite this diversity, a common feature of these movements is their stated opposition to the neo-Kantian Schulphilosophie that had dominated German thought for nearly half a century. In that respect, at the very least, they were entirely successful: whereas many of the interwar movements are still'very much a part of today's philosophical discussion,' Hohendahl points out, the works of Hermann Cohen, Paul Natorp, Wilhelm Windelband, and Heinrich Rickert are largely consigned to the margins of intellectual history (pp. 18-19). 1\n\nA significant problem for attempts to discuss the legacy of Kant is that his influence in Germany is so pervasive that it is hard to separate the critics from the disciples: nearly everyone in the tradition owes a huge debt-acknowledged or not-to Kant. Hohendahl is aware of this and notes that he had to choose between focusing on the ways in which the various interwar movements diverged from what had gone before, and the ways in which they were continuous with it. He opts\n\n1 Ernst Cassirer is of course the great exception here: he has been read throughout the last half-century, in part (though by no means exclusively) because of his famous conflict with Martin Heidegger.\n\n41. 50\n\n## ANDREW CHIGNELL\n\nfor the former, and for good reason-revolutions and ruptures are usually more interesting than discipleship and run-of-the-mill development. In an effort to provide a slight counterbalance here, however, I propose to emphasize the latter.\n\nIt would be tiresome simply to list the various ways in which the interwar critics are indebted to their neo-Kantian predecessors, of course. So I will try to show, somewhat more controversially, that the philosophical content of neo-Kantianism, even if not its institutional form, was more adequate to the needs of the 1920s and 1930s than its interwar critics allowed. The goal is to lend credence to the idea that the demise of classical neo-Kantianism between the wars had at least as much to do with institutional, psychological, and/or political developments as with any strictly philosophical failures. The idea is one that Hohendahl also advocates: 'the debates of the 1920s and 1930s,' he says, 'are no longer firmly located in the field of philosophy' (p. 38).\n\nIn the third section, I go on very briefly to consider one of the figures Hohendahl discusses-Georg Luk√Ücs-and argue that where his criticisms of Kantianism hit a target, that target is usually a neo-Kantian philosopher rather than the Sage of K√∂nigsberg himself. My suspicion is that this is true of some of the other prominent critiques of Kant in this period as well, although I will not be able to make a case for that broader claim here. If the suspicion is correct, then the attacks on'Kant' effectively (if paradoxically) created yet another need to go back to the historical Kant and try to reconstruct his views anew. In other words, the realization that the neo-Kantians had not been particularly faithful to their namesake may have been part of what fueled renewed efforts by historians of philosophy after World War II (on both sides of the Atlantic) to reread and reconstruct Kant's philosophy more carefully.\n\nIt is worth emphasizing that the goal here is not reverently to portray Kant as unworthy of criticism; that would be quixotic and silly. The goal, rather, is to supplement Hohendahl's illuminating survey of the discontinuities by considering some of the unacknowledged affinities between neo-Kantian philosophy and the intellectual climate of the Weimar and National Socialist eras. A secondary goal is to suggest that the critiques of'Kant' in the latter eras-accurate or not-planted seeds that ultimately flowered into the scholarly efforts of the present day.\n\n## II. NEO-KANTIANISM AS SCAPEGOAT\n\nThe two main schools of neo-Kantianism are identified not by their doctrines but rather by their geographical headquarters. Philosophers in the Marburg school-Hermann Cohen, Paul Natorp, and Ernst Cassirer, among othersdeveloped the critical metaphysics of experience (without the metaphysics of the thing in itself), and sought to deduce constitutive a priori principles that were\n\n## KANT BETWEEN THE WARS\n\nconsistent with the mathematical and scientific discoveries of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Philosophers in the Baden school, on the other hand, focused less on natural science and more on the theory of value-the right, the good, and the beautiful-and the logical structure of such value judgments. The Badensians were also more concerned with meta-philosophical issues: Windelband and Rickert argued, for instance, that understanding the formal conditions of a given type of knowledge helps maintain disciplinary boundaries between the sciences of nature (fact) and the sciences of spirit (value). 2\n\nIn the years following World War I, neo-Kantianism of both varieties became (in the words of a disgruntled Cassirer) the'scapegoat' ( S√ºndenb√∂cke ) for many of the perceived problems in imperial and Weimar culture. In Hohendahl's words, the Marburg and Baden projects were regarded'essentially as a continuation of the prewar era,' and thus as inadequate to the'profound sense of loss' and severe social, political, and cultural turbulences swirling through Germany after the Great War (see Hohendahl's essay in this issue). In addition, prominent neoKantians like Natorp had written popular essays in the years leading up to the war arguing that Germany was within its rights as an intellectually superior culture to widen its sphere of influence-even via force if necessary (see Hohendahl's essay in this issue). Likewise, Emil Lask-one of Rickert's greatest students-had insisted on fighting for Germany in the trenches, and died tragically in the process.\n\nAll of this made it hard for the postwar generation to see that, from a purely philosophical point of view, neo-Kantianism was reasonably well-suited to the era of Dadaismus, social democracy, and All Quiet on the Western Front. For starters, the neo-Kantians could (and some of them-most prominently Cassirer-did) plausibly argue that it was absolute idealism -with its sweeping claims about the march of history, and its optimism about the increasingly rational self-unfolding of the Absolute-that best cohered with the na√Øve meliorism, ethnocentrism, and imperialism that led Europe into the catastrophic war.\n\nSecond, by way of contrast, the neo-Kantians could emphasize the antimetaphysical and politically benign impulses of their program-in particular, their view that philosophy is a handmaiden to natural science, protecting the right of empirical inquiry to tell us about reality, and restricting the Geisteswissenschaften to the more amorphous realms of culture. Such impulses should have been attractive to a politically jaded and religiously disillusioned continent. Indeed, they were\n\n2 For a complete overview of classical neo-Kantianism see Klaus K√∂hnke's, Entstehung und Aufstieg des Neukantianismus: Die deutsche Universit√§tsphilosophie zwischen Idealismus und Positivismus (Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp, 1986). This book was later translated by J. Hollingdale as The Rise of Neo-Kantianism (NewYork: Cambridge University Press, 1991). For a much shorter overview, see my'On going back to Kant' as well as the other essays in the summer 2008 special edition of the Philosophical Forum devoted to'Neo-Kantianism and its Relevance Today.'\n\n## ANDREW CHIGNELL\n\nthus attractive, but only when they were not flying under the neo-Kantian banner. For, as Hohendahl suggests in his discussion of Carnap, the positivist program of the Vienna Circle and the later logical empiricists more or less appropriated the handmaiden-to-science vision of philosophy that was prominent in neoKantianism. One can almost hear the later Viennese in a 1887 statement of neo-Kantian Alois Riehl: 'True philosophy follows science; in constant connection with science, it is ever obtaining a clearer and more complete understanding of science.' 3 Conversely, Carnap and Hans Reichenbach-despite their official resistance to Kant and the synthetic a priori -ultimately preserved a commitment to the'constitutive a priori '-that is, the evolving, coordinating principles of natural science and mathematics.\n\nIn addition to being antimetaphysical supporters of natural science, the neoKantians tended to be moderate humanists in their political philosophy. And with a few exceptions-most notoriously, the anti-Semitic Badensian Bruno Bauchthey were also dedicated to egalitarian ideals and progressive social democracy. It seems as though precisely that sort of movement would have been attractive to intellectuals on a continent that had just been ravaged by the illiberal unreason of war.\n\nMy admittedly speculative suggestion here, then, is that far from needing to collapse after World War I, neo-Kantianism might and perhaps should very well have come into its own, at least from a broadly philosophical point of view. It had vanquished Hegelianism, had kept the radical impulses of the Kierkegaards, Schopenhauers, and Nietzsches out of the mainstream, and had succeeded in influencing Jewish thought (via Hermann Cohen and Jonas Cohn), Russian thought (witness the very active neo-Kantian school in St. Petersburg), and even British thought at the moment when (paradoxically) the English saw themselves breaking with all things Teutonic by renouncing Bradleyanism. 4\n\nSo what went wrong? Why, given these apparent affinities with the interwar Zeitgeist, did neo-Kantianism instead suffer catastrophic collapse?\n\n3 Reihl, Der philosophische Kritizismus, 3 vols. (Leipzig: A. Kr√∂ner, 1887). The quotation is taken from Reihl, The Principles of the Critical Philosophy: Introduction to the Theory and Science of Metaphysics, vol. 3, trans. A. Fairbanks (London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Tr√ºbner, &amp; Co., 1894) 17.\n\n4 The triumph of Moore and Russell over the neo-Hegelians was only really completed in the 1920s, just as Russell was writing a long and enthusiastic Foreword to an English translation of Friedrich Lange's History of Materialism (the translation appeared in 1925, the year after Bradley died). See Friedrich Lange, Geschichte der Materialismus (Iserlohn: J. Baedeker, 1866, expanded 1873-85), translated by E. C. Thomas into English as The History of Materialism and Criticism of its Present Importance (London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Tr√ºbner, &amp; Co., 1925). Interestingly, in Lange's work, we find an important antecedent of the Husserlian method of epoch√© -the practice of bracketing existence-assumptions about objects in order to focus on and characterize the experiential field.\n\n## KANT BETWEEN THE WARS\n\nOne suggestion is flatfootedly institutional: There is a natural tendency on the part of any group of young philosophers (especially, it seems, young German philosophers) to try to be revolutionary, to seek recognition for starting something new, to band together in the patricidal overthrow of their Doktorv√§ter. Adding to this is the fact that the canons of the German academy require that doctoral theses as well habilitations contribute something new to the storehouse of human knowledge. The requirement of originality often heightens the patricidal urge just mentioned. But whatever merits this suggestion has by way of explaining the revolutionary works of the younger generation, it does not seem to fit older figures (e.g., Husserl) who were already well-established.\n\nAnother suggestion focuses less on institutional pressures and more on individual psychology. Peter Eli Gordon claims that after the war a'new hunger for metaphysical speculation' seized intellectuals in the younger generation (many of whose friends and comrades had died in the trenches) and led them to'turn away in droves from the critical model and in its stead forge diverse philosophies of religion, revolutionary utopia, and existence.' 5 This urge to metaphysics and utopianism was inevitable, according to Gordon, after so many decades of careful, critical philosophy had proved impotent against a catastrophic global war. The most extreme instance of this was Heidegger, of course, whose project after the war was explicitly to overthrow his neo-Kantian forebears in an effort to stage a kind of rebirth of metaphysics itself (although it was often done, paradoxically, in the name of Kant himself). But whatever merits this suggestion has by way of explaining Heidegger, Rosenzweig, and perhaps even Luk√Ücs, it does not seem to fit antimetaphysical figures like Carnap and Husserl.\n\nA third suggestion is straightforwardly political: Because the vast majority of the neo-Kantians were social democrats, and because a large number of them were Jewish, they were viewed with hostility by the increasingly powerful right-wing movements of the late 1920s and early 1930s. Jewish neo-Kantians who were still active in 1933 (Richard H√∂nigswald, Jonas Cohn, and Ernst Cassirer) were ultimately forced to retire and many fled. Those who stayed, such as Husserl (who declined a professorship at UCLA), suffered professional demotion and personal humiliation. But, on the other hand, many Jewish critics of neo-Kantianism also fled (e.g., Reichenbach) and yet their views gained prominence across both continents. And Husserl's personal demise in 1938 clearly did not prevent phenomenology from enjoying huge influence in the 20th century. Moreover, some neo-Kantians did keep their Lehrst√ºhle: Bruno Bauch was a favorite of the Nazis, of course, but Nicolai Hartmann, too, was allowed to continue teaching in Berlin throughout the war as long as he held his political tongue. Although they trained\n\n5 Peter Eli Gordon, 'Science, Finitude, and Infinity: Neo-Kantianism and the Birth of Existentialism,' Jewish Social Studies 6, 1 (1999): 30-53, 33.\n\n## ANDREW CHIGNELL\n\nsome of the graduate students who would go on to great prominence in the later 20th century (Hans-Georg Gadamer, in particular), the fact that these neoKantians kept teaching during the interwar period did not prevent the movement as a whole from falling into disrepute.\n\nDespite the merits of these three explanatory suggestions, then, the wholesale collapse of institutional neo-Kantianism remains something of an historical mystery. 6\n\n## III. CASE STUDY: LUK`CS' KANT\n\nHohendahl is clearly right to say that'there is no reason to understand the legacy of Kant exclusively in affirmative terms' and that a'critical or negative stance' can owe as much of a debt as an affirmative appropriation. It is also worth considering, however, the extent to which the interwar critiques of Kant actually apply to the man-in-himself, rather than his late 19th century appearances. In the space that remains, I can only discuss one of the authors Hohendahl discusses-Georg Luk√Ücs. My suggestion is that some of the bestknown criticisms of Kant made by Luk√Ücs at the height of his career do not apply very well to Kant himself, even if they do apply to some neo-Kantians. More interesting than this, however, is the fact that many of the concerns that motivate Luk√Ücs to criticize Kant are actually concerns that Kant himself openly expressed.\n\nAlthough Luk√Ücs wrote some important pieces on Kantian themes earlier in his career, History and Class Consciousness (1923) is by far his best-known work. In it, Luk√Ücs repeatedly criticizes Kant's philosophy as (in Hohendahl's words) 'the most radical and advanced consciousness of the early bourgeoisie' (p. 21). In the famous chapter on'Reification and the Consciousness of the Proletariat,' Luk√Ücs justifies this characterization by arguing that Kant's work exemplifies the highest development of the reifying'rationalism' that subsumes all concrete particulars under concepts and principles, and integrates all individual cognitions into architectonic systems. But the critical philosophy also places limits on pure reason, Luk√Ücs says, and in particular on its ability to answer fundamental questions about the transcendental nature of mind (why, for instance, is there only sensibility and understanding, rather than some third basic faculty)? For Luk√Ücs, the tension between these aspirations and limits somehow'reflects the limits of the new social order of the bourgeoisie'; indeed, he claims in one place that the entire tradition\n\n6 For more, see Ulrich Sieg, Aufstieg und Niedergang des Marburger Neukantianismus: die Geschichte einer philosophischen Schulgemeinschaft (K√∂nigshausen und Neumann: W√ºrzburg, 1994).\n\n## KANT BETWEEN THE WARS\n\nof critical philosophy'springs from the reified structure of consciousness,' and that it ends in a series of'Antinomies of Bourgeois Thought.' 7\n\nAt this juncture, readers of Spinoza, Leibniz, and Wolff are likely to protest that the demands for rational understanding and system were already acutely manifested in 17th-century rationalism. Kant scholars, other the other hand, may complain about Luk√Ücs' overemphasis on the'rationalist' aspect of the critical philosophy: after all, from the mid-1760s onward, Kant clearly opposes the unrestricted use of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, and also insists that pure reason is unable to rise to the'unconditioned' and provide a comprehensive account of mind and world.\n\nMore striking, however, is the fact that Luk√Ücs sometimes writes as though Kant himself was unaware of the tension between demand for systematic cognition and the self-imposed limits of critical reason, and that he thus ended up in the'Antinomies of Bourgeois Reason' despite himself. But while this charge may apply to some of the neo-Kantians, it is difficult to see how it could apply to Kant himself. Kant repeatedly expresses not only his awareness of the limits of theoretical knowledge, but also his frustration with that fact and his nostalgia for something like epistemic acquaintance with the whole. 'Why,' Kant asks, 'has Providence set many objects, although they are intimately connected with our highest interest, so high that it is barely granted to us to encounter them in an indistinct perception, doubted even by ourselves, through which our searching glance is more enticed than satisfied?' ( Critique of Pure Reason, A743-4/B771-2).\n\nKant's own response to the antinomies, of course, is neither to give up (as Lukacs claims he did in History and Class Consciousness [p. 134]), nor to give in to the speculative urge, but rather to set knowledge aside and try to be content with mere'belief' ( Glaube ) about things-in-themselves. In other words, Kant claims that there is plenty for critical philosophers to say about the'unconditioned,' so long as we recognize that the status of our claims is that of hope, acceptance, or'firm rational belief,' rather than that of knowledge or cognition. 8\n\nLuk√Ücs' criticism of Kant's moral philosophy likewise seems to stray somewhat from its stated target. He charges Kant with defending (in Hohendahl's words) the'individualism of the new class subject' and thereby allowing the'loss of substantive freedom' (p. 23). Here he is presumably referring to the fact that the phenomenal laws, for Kant, govern the entirety of the empirical world-including the empirical human self. Neo-Kantians in both the Marburg and the Baden schools adopted this deterministic picture, but in keeping with their opposition to the thing-in-itself, they also jettisoned Kant's practical commitment to a substantive\n\n7 Georg Luk√Ücs, History and Class Consciousness, trans. R. Livingstone (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1971) 110.\n\n8 See my'Belief in Kant,' Philosophical Review 116, 3 (2007): 323-60.\n\n## ANDREW CHIGNELL\n\nnoumenal or transcendental freedom that is compatible with this phenomenal determinism. From the historical Kant's point of view, however, this is a serious misstep, for it is precisely in the hard-to-fathom agency of the transcendental self-the self that is insulated from all causal and economic determination-that the substantive freedom required for moral responsibility is located.\n\nLuk√Ücs dismisses such talk of transcendental freedom as'empty' and'unable [...] to avoid the abyss of fatalism,' but there is no specification of precisely what in Kant's compatibilism he finds unworkable. 9 Indeed, he appears to be opposed to the idea of compatibilism generally, noting that'the freedom (of the subject) is neither able to overcome the sensuous necessity of the system of knowledge and the soullessness of the fatalistically conceived laws of nature, nor is it able to give them any meaning.' 10 But this is more stipulation than argument, and thus makes it tempting to say of Luk√Ücs' critique what Hohendahl says of Max Horkheimer's: namely, that its aim'is not a reconstruction of the historical Kant or even an evaluation of relevant philosophical problems' (p. 35). Instead, Luk√Ücs seems (at least in this book) to give in to the temptation to use Kant and other modern philosophers as stalking-horses for the (bourgeois) conception of the world and the self that he hopes to undermine. This is an acceptable rhetorical strategy, of course, but it is also useful for readers to consider whether such attacks really hit their stated target.\n\n## IV. WILL THE REAL KANT PLEASE STEP FORWARD?\n\nThe perceived unattractiveness of prominent neo-Kantian readings of Kant elicited more than just criticism; it also led some of the members of the interwar generation to call for a more painstaking historical and rational reconstruction of Kant's own views. Despite all the criticism, there was still a strong urge among some of them, anyway, to take on the mantle of the great Prussian philosopher. Thus, for example, Husserl ultimately adopted the label'transcendental idealism' for his own philosophy, and Heidegger's lengthy study of the first Critique was advertised as'the first, explicit ground-laying for metaphysics' of the sort that he himself aimed to continue. 11\n\nAs a result of all this, by mid-century, the legacy of Kant had become both so contested and so crucial that a new generation of scholars saw the need for yet\n\n9 Luk√Ücs (1971): 133.\n\n10 Ibid: 134.\n\n11 Edmund Husserl, Ideas pertaining to a Pure Phenomenology and to a Phenomenological Philosophy, First Book, trans.

Building on the careful textual, philological, and editorial work of various friends (if not exactly card-carrying members) of the neo-Kantian movement, such as Erich Adickes and Benno Erdmann, the generation that came into its own after World War II founded the vibrant traditions of historical Kant scholarship that are now flourishing across both Europe and the Americas.\n\nIn a roundabout fashion, then, the powerful attacks on Kant in the interwar period led not to a weakening of Kant's legacy but rather to a new and somewhat more careful historical and philosophical study of Kant's works. At the beginning of the 21st century, that exciting project is still very much underway. 12\n\nCornell University\n\n12 I am grateful to Peter Hohendahl and Thomas Teufel for helpful comments on an earlier draft of this paper, and for many good discussions along the way.

        "user_prompt": "Philosophy paper text:\nMendelssohnian Enlightenment and Women‚Äôs Contributions to Philosophy in the Late Eighteenth Century\n\nCorey W. Dyck\n\nWhen attempting to capture the concept of enlightenment that underlies and motivates philosophical (and political and scientific) developments in the 18th century, historians of philosophy frequently rely upon a needlessly but intentionally exclusive account. This, namely, is the conception of enlightenment first proposed by Kant in his famous essay of 1784, which takes enlightenment to consist in the ‚Äúemergence from the self-imposed state of minority‚Äù and which is only possible for a ‚Äúpublic‚Äù to attain as a result of the public use of reason, a privilege enjoyed by citizens and exemplified in the activity of the scholar ( *Gelehrter* ). That women, among other groups, did not hold the status of citizens and did not enjoy access to the institutions or training that might gain them recognition as scholars is apparently not a concern for Kant, as he notes that the enlightened condition is likely out of reach anyway for ‚Äúby far the greatest part of humankind (including the entire fair sex)‚Äù (AA 8:35). For Kant, women have no part in enlightenment, neither as its principal propagators nor as its intended recipients, and this fact is apparently reflected in our philosophical histories of the period. Not only are the diverse forms of female intellectuality in the period assigned little significance‚Äîwhich is to be expected given the bias towards a highly specialized form of scholarly intervention in public debate‚Äîbut even the topics on which women did publish, such as the theory of education, are categorized as of merely popular rather than philosophical interest, in spite of often being thoroughly informed by the philosophical views of the time.\n\nAll this leads one to wonder what a history of this period *could* look like when considered from the perspective of a different, more inclusive conception of enlightenment, and in this chapter I propose to conduct an experiment of sorts just along these lines. As opposed to Kant‚Äôs exclusionary conception, I will instead take that proposed by his distinguished contemporary, Moses Mendelssohn, as my starting point. In addition to offering a conception of enlightenment distinctive both for its wide scope and progressive character, Mendelssohn‚Äôs has the advantage, or so I will show, of bringing the manifold intellectual contributions of a diverse set of women into focus, though it does more than this in that it also reveals these women to actively and critically engage with key aspects of Mendelssohn‚Äôs and others‚Äô philosophical views. To the end of showing how this is accomplished, I will begin with a consideration of Mendelssohn‚Äôs comparatively under-appreciated essay on enlightenment.\n\n1. A Primer on Mendelssohnian Enlightenment\n\nMendelssohn‚Äôs essay, ‚ÄúOn the Question: What does it Mean to Enlighten? [ *Ueber die Frage: was hei√üt aufkl√§ren* ],‚Äù appeared in the *Berlinische Monatschrift* in September 1784, in a response to the question which was posed in a contribution to the same journal in December 1783. Mendelssohn‚Äôs discussion begins by situating the notion within a constellation of related terms, namely, ‚Äú *enlightenment*, *culture*, *education* [ *Aufkl√§rung*, *Kultur*, *Bildung* ]‚Äù which he identifies as ‚Äúnew arrivals‚Äù in the German language. While the coinages may be novel, he denies that these terms designate completely new concepts (just as, he claims, a people might not have a term for ‚Äòvirtue‚Äô or ‚Äòsuperstitition‚Äô but are not for that reason thought to lack them). In addition to their novelty, these three concepts have in common the fact that they designate ‚Äúmodifications of social [ *geselligen* ] life‚Äù or ‚Äúeffects of the industry and efforts of human beings [ *Menschen* ] to improve their social condition‚Äù (JubA 6.1, 115).\n\nMendelssohn next turns to a consideration of how these concepts are related, and he contends that they are closely interconnected; specifically, he claims that *Bildung* is the combination of culture and enlightenment. These latter are, in turn, distinguished inasmuch as the former concerns the *practical* and enlightenment the *theoretical*, though in both cases Mendelssohn considers objective and subjective expressions of the attainment of each, that is, respectively, what is produced or acquired through each and what sort of skills or habits might be developed in a subject enjoying this condition. So, culture can be understood either (objectively) as relating to goodness, refinement, and beauty in arts, craftsmanship, and ‚Äúsocial mores [ *Geselligkeitssitten* ]‚Äù or (subjectively) concerning industriousness and skillfulness in arts and craftsmanship, and in the inclinations, drives, and habits relating to social mores. By contrast, enlightenment, at least on an initial pass, has to do (objectively) with the acquisition of theoretical cognition and (subjectively) with the skill to reflect rationally on all that which pertains to the concerns of human life.\n\nSignificantly, for Mendelssohn enlightenment, culture, and *Bildung*, are not all-or-nothing conditions but admit of degrees, where these depend on the extent to which enlightenment, culture, or state of *Bildung* agrees with the ‚Äúvocation of the human being [ *Bestimmung des Menschen* ].‚Äù As we will see in a later section, what Mendelssohn understands through this phrase, popularised by Johann Joachim Spalding‚Äôs book of the same name, is the development of the human being‚Äôs distinctive capacities (including but not limited to cognitive capacities like the intellect and will). In any case, Mendelssohn does make clear in his essay that this vocations constitutes a standard against which human progress can be judged: ‚ÄúAt all times, I set the vocation of the human being as the measure and goal of all our strivings and efforts, as a point towards which we must direct our eyes if we would not lose ourselves‚Äù (JubA 6.1, 115-16). A people, then, attains to a higher state of *Bildung* ‚Äúthe more its social condition is brought into harmony with the vocation of the human being through art and industry‚Äù; similarly with respect to culture, the more that inclinations, drives, and habits in social mores ‚Äúin a people correspond to the vocation of the human being, the more culture is attributed to it‚Äù (JubA 6.1, 115). Enlightenment likewise comes in degrees, depending on the extent to which we become skillful in reflecting ‚Äúon matters pertaining to human life, according to the standard of their importance and influence upon the vocation of the human being‚Äù (ibid.), though rather than pertaining to a *people* ( *Volk* ), as was the case with *Bildung* and culture, Mendelssohn claims that enlightenment primarily pertains to the individual (and only derivatively to a people or *Nation*; cf. JubA 6.1, 117).\n\nBy way of making this last claim more precise, Mendelssohn distinguishes between the human being‚Äôs vocation considered either as a human being or as a citizen ( *B√ºrger* ), which is to say considered in relation to life in a society. As he notes, the distinction is only relevant to enlightenment since ‚Äúthe *human being* as *human being* [i.e., considered as an individual] does not stand in need of *culture*, but does need *enlightenment* ‚Äù (JubA 6.1, 116). This introduces a distinction between two sorts of enlightenment‚Äîthat of the human being as human being and that of the human being as citizen‚Äîwhere the precise demands of the latter depend upon the ‚Äúestate and occupation [ *Stand und Beruf* ]‚Äù of the individual in society, but those of the former pertains to the human being in abstraction from such differences:\n\nThe *enlightenment* that interests the human being as human being is *universal*, without distinction in terms of estate; the enlightenment of the human being considered as citizen is modified according to *estate* and *occupation.* (JubA 6.1, 117).\n\nAccordingly, while enlightenment for Mendelssohn is understood, broadly, in terms of the accumulation of theoretical cognition and improvement of our capacity to reflect on the importance of matters in relation to our vocation, it is clearly the enlightenment of the human being *as human being* that is of foremost interest, where this pertains to improving ourselves in virtue of those dispositions and capacities we all have in common rather than with respect to that which sets us apart.\n\nYet Mendelssohn also recognizes that ‚Äú[c]ertain truths that are useful to the human being as human being can at the same time be harmful to him as citizen‚Äù (JubA 6.1, 117), which raises the spectre of conflicts or collisions ( *Kollisionsf√§lle* ) between our vocations. In order to arrive at a comprehensive account of the possible conflicts and their potential remedies, Mendelssohn further distinguishes the ‚Äúessential [ *wesentlichen* ]‚Äù and ‚Äúaccidental [ *zuf√§lligen* ]‚Äù or ‚Äúextra-essential [ *au√üerwesentlichen* ]‚Äù vocations or determinations ( *Bestimmungen* ) of each. Concerning the possible (and actual) conflicts between our extra-essential vocation as human beings and either our essential or extra-essential vocation as citizens, he calls generally for rules to be established to decide these cases (JubA 6.1, 117). More problematic are the conflicts that involve our *essential* vocation as human beings, and Mendelssohn considers what is to be done when these clash with our essential vocation as citizens and our extra-essential vocation as human beings. Concerning the former, which takes place when the regime fails to recognize that enlightenment is ‚Äúindispensable [ *unentbehrlich* ]‚Äù for humanity ‚Äúthrough all estates of the realms [ *√ºber alle St√§nde des Reichs* ],‚Äù Mendelssohn rather cryptically asserts that in such cases philosophy should ‚Äúlay its hand on its mouth [ *Hier lege die Philosophie die Hand auf den Mund*!],‚Äù presumably lest, in publically disclosing the conflict, it forces the regime‚Äôs hand in imposing stricter measures to stifle enlightenment (JubA 6.1, 117). Concerning the latter conflict‚Äîthat between the essential and extra-essential aspects of the human being‚Äôs vocation as human being‚ÄîMendelssohn cites as an example the case where truths that are salutary for humanity nonetheless tear down the ‚Äúprinciples of religion and ethics.‚Äù Here Mendelssohn recommends that the virtuous would-be enlightener should ‚Äúproceed with caution and forebearance, and prefer to tolerate prejudice‚Äù rather than run the risk of being driven out along with the truth, even as he recognizes himself that this maxim is ripe for abuse (JubA 6.1, 118).\n\nIn order to better appreciate the distinctive character of Mendelssohn‚Äôs conception of enlightenment it will be helpful to briefly contrast it with that of Kant, as elaborated in his famous essay: ‚ÄúAnswering the Question: What is Enlightenment?‚Äù As is well known, Kant‚Äôs conception of enlightenment involves casting off the fetters through which one willingly subjects the use of one‚Äôs own understanding to the authority of others, that is, enlightenment ‚Äúis the human being‚Äôs emergence from his self-incurred minority‚Äù (AA 8:35). While Kant enjoins us each to ‚Äú[h]ave courage to make use of your *own* understanding‚Äù (ibid.), he proceeds to observe that it is rare for an individual to attain enlightenment, given the appeal of and habituation to letting others make decisions on one‚Äôs behalf; yet, he claims that it is less unlikely that a public ( *Publicum* ) should attain this, and it can do so through the freedom of its members to make public ( *√∂ffentlich* ) use of their reason. This is, namely, a use of their reason apart from, and which does not interfere with, their occupation of a given office or profession, and which is exemplified, according to Kant, in the use of one‚Äôs reason ‚Äúas a scholar before the entire public of the world of readers‚Äù (AA 8:37). So, while we remain beholden to the guidance and censorship of others in the private exercise of reason in the context of the office we might occupy, no such constraints (ought to) obtain concerning reason‚Äôs public use, and provided that a people enjoys such freedom in the public use of reason, it is possible for it to achieve enlightenment, albeit only slowly given the difficulty in overcoming implanted prejudices (AA 8:36).\n\nKant‚Äôs essay would appear three months after Mendelssohn‚Äôs, in December of 1784, though he was apparently unaware of Mendelssohn‚Äôs response when he composed his own. This led him to wonder publicly in a footnote added to his own contribution, whether ‚Äúchance may bring about agreement in [their] thoughts‚Äù (cf. AA 8:42). There are, no doubt, some initial similarities, such as in their respective distinction between the context of professional life and the extra-professional context, yet the differences are arguably more striking, three of which we might point out here. First, we have seen that Mendelssohn approaches the enlightenment through a wider perspective, as a ‚Äúmodification of social life,‚Äù and even if he will proceed to emphasize that enlightenment pertains to the human being considered as (individual) human being as well as as a member of society, it remains the case that for Mendelssohn enlightenment is enacted *within* society, and indeed would remain incomplete were this not the case inasmuch as culture relates to enlightenment as theory does to practice. Kantian enlightenment, by contrast, is enacted publically, but the fact that it consists in debate engaged by scholars does not suggest any corresponding social forum. Second, for Mendelssohn enlightenment itself, as consisting in the individual‚Äôs attainment of cognition and the development of our cognitive powers, can only be attained, by degrees, as a result of a gradual process of training and education. For Kant, however, enlightenment is the result of a spontaneous act of will or practical reason, and presumably either attained all at once or not at all, and which in spite of rarely being executed is nonetheless the function of a capacity that belongs to every human being as such. Third, and finally, Mendelssohn‚Äôs focus in his essay, as opposed to Kant‚Äôs, is squarely on the *enlightener*, that is on the individual who would, after attaining enlightenment, seek to guide others to the same. This much is signalled in the title of his essay‚Äî‚ÄúWhat does it mean *to enlighten*?‚Äù‚Äîas it is in his discussion of how the enlightener should proceed when the enlightenment of others would conflict with the duties of the citizen. For Kant‚Äôs part, he allows that the example of the enlightened individual might inspire others and ‚Äúdisseminate the spirit of a rational valuing of one‚Äôs own worth and of the calling of each individual to think for himself‚Äù (AA 8:36), though such individuals are ultimately so rare, and prejudice so widespread, that the gradual enlightenment of a public instead is the best that can be realistically hoped for. As will soon become clear, these three distinctive features of Mendelssohn‚Äôs conception of enlightenment do not merely mark a difference of opinion between him and Kant but actually prove rather consequential as they happen to constitute three themes‚Äîthe importance of culture for enlightenment, the necessity (and theory) of education, and the manner in which the enlightener should proceed when faced with prejudice‚Äîthat were vigorously engaged by women near the turn of the 19th century.\n\n2. The Culture of Enlightenment: Henriette Herz and Rahel Levin Varnhagen\n\nAs we have seen, Mendelssohn introduces a distinction between *Aufkl√§rung* and *Kultur* in his ‚ÄúWhat does it mean to enlighten?‚Äù As it happens, Mendelssohn was challenged on precisely this distinction in a letter responding to his essay from the enthusiastic enlightener August Hennings (about whom more in the fourth section, below), who had rejected the distinction between enlightenment and culture as he understands culture to be just the cultivation in us effected *through* enlightenment (JubA 13 228). In response, Mendelssohn upholds the difference between the two, claiming that culture has ‚Äúsomething intentional [ *etwas vors√§tzliches* ]‚Äù about it, in contrast with enlightenment, a fact he takes to be confirmed in our ordinary linguistic usage; moreover, he claims that it is sometimes the case that enlightenment is the *effect* of culture rather than *vice versa* (JubA 13, 235).\n\nThis last claim points to an important feature of Mendelssohn‚Äôs discussion: as important as the *distinction* between culture and enlightenment is, he also takes pains to emphasize their crucial *inter* dependence (which is not limited to their mutual potential to produce one another). Not only does he compare the relationship between the two to that between ‚Äútheory and practice,‚Äù as we have seen, but he also contends that they ‚Äústand in the most precise connection, even if subjectively they can very often be separated‚Äù (JubA 6.1, 116). Indeed, Mendelssohn assigns an indispensable role to culture in spreading and securing the gains of enlightenment, a service it yields by promoting the *sociability* of human beings through the refinement of manners and the expansion of opportunities for engagement and concourse. Culture likewise serves as an important check on enlightenment for Mendelssohn, making it important that both are cultivated at once. For instance, doctrines that pass as enlightened might nonetheless have the consequence of degrading public morals or fomenting the development of manners hostile towards concourse among individuals (even as they adopt the mask of ‚Äúgentleness of spirit‚Äù). As he writes in the essay, ‚Äú[w]here enlightenment and culture advance in equal strides, then they serve one another as the best means for preventing prejudice‚Äù (JubA 6.1, 118) a claim he re-iterates in his response to Hennings, with particular emphasis on the potential for the misuse of enlightenment: ‚Äú[i]f enlightenment outstrips culture by too wide a measure, the former can of course become dangerous‚Äù (JubA 13, 237)\n\nFor Mendelssohn, then, the pursuit of culture is integral to the efforts to attain enlightenment, and it is for this reason that Mendelssohn also lays considerable emphasis on the importance of various forms of association. In the enlightenment essay, Mendelssohn had already indicated the importance of developing the culture of human beings with respect to their specific ‚Äúestates and professions,‚Äù where the aim was to further association with one‚Äôs fellows *within* a given estate and profession, and where Mendelssohn seems to deny the need for the pursuit of culture insofar as it might involve the association across different estates (JubA 6.1, 116-17). However, in a subsequent essay, Mendelssohn thinks better of this as he recognizes the potential harms caused by the strict separation of the estates; so, after (re-)introducing a distinction between ‚Äúoffices [ *√Ñmter* ]‚Äù and ‚Äúestates [ *St√§nde* ],‚Äù he continues:\n\nWhat is useful for offices can be damaging for the estates, and vice versa. In large nations, where businesses are abundant, distinguishing them ever more carefully is convenient; but the estates must be brought into connection all the more as the distinction between offices inclines us to separate them. (JubA 6.1, 151)\n\nWhen it comes to the types of associations that best promote this intermingling, Mendelssohn makes specific mention of ‚Äúbrotherhoods [ *Br√ºderschaften* ], orders, and guilds‚Äù which, whatever their precise purposes, have the common function of enabling sociability between estates in the pursuit of a shared end (JubA 6.1, 151). What is in any case clear is that Mendelssohn likely does *not* have in mind here the ‚Äúreading societies‚Äù and other sorts of more formal learned gatherings, such as his own *Mittwochgesellschaft*. In addition to appealing to a rather more limited clientele, these groups contribute little to the refinement of manners given their focus on the delivery of lectures or the (dramatic) reading of poetry and plays. Indeed, this dependence on the written word strikes Mendelssohn as inconsistent with the sort of conversational intercourse that promotes culture; as he writes (in a rather different context in *Jerusalem* ), ‚ÄúEverywhere there is the dead letter; never the spirit of lively conversation [ *lebendige Unterhaltung* ]‚Äù (JubA 8, 169-70; JRP 103)\n\nAn obvious example of the sort of (informal) association that conforms to Mendelssohn‚Äôs model would be the *salon*, an institution that flourished in Berlin (with some interruptions) beginning in 1780. What is particularly relevant about the salon in this context is that it frequently hosted individuals holding diverse social standing. One distinguishing feature of Berlin salons was that rather than being hosted by female members of the aristocracy, as was the case in France, they were often hosted by Jewish women. The two most famous ‚Äúsalons‚Äù of turn-of-the-century Berlin were those hosted by Henriette Herz (1764‚Äì1847) and Rahel Levin Varnhagen (later Fredericke Varnhagen von Ense) (1771‚Äì1833). Notably, Herz and Varnhagen were childhood friends, were both Jewish, and were also closely acquainted with Mendelssohn and his daughters, and it was Mendelssohn‚Äôs open house that served as a particular model and inspiration for their own. The intermingling of the estates within these salons run by Jewish women from families of means is perhaps unsurprising‚Äîtheir comparative wealth and (informal) education (particularly compared to women brought up in Christian families) meant that they had cultivation of manners combined with access to the highest social strata, even as their religion marked them as outsiders.\n\nAs one of the few quasi-public spaces in which women could directly engage with the contemporary culture and also employ their own agency, especially in creating and exploring different models of self-formation, the salon was an important feature of intellectual life in Berlin from the late 18th century onwards (even if it was frequently mythologized in subsequent accounts). Moreover, and in spite of the considerable differences in their respective gatherings (reflecting their own interests and particular talents), both Herz and Varnhagen can be understood as seeking to promote culture in the distinctly Mendelssohnian sense. In the case of Herz, her salon developed out of the regular gathering hosted by her husband, the philosophical physican and favourite student of Kant, Marcus Herz (1747-1803), in which a prominent and diverse clientele heard lectures and witnessed scientific experiments (which she also attended). Herz‚Äôs salon, which ran from roughly 1780 until her husband‚Äôs death, started as an alternative for those members of the younger generation in attendance with interests in discussing the latest literature, including the young von Humboldts (whom she taught the Hebraic alphabet), Schleiermacher, and the Schlegels (and it is here Friedrich met his future wife, Brendel Veit-Mendelssohn). Herz herself does not refrain from boasting that ‚Äúat that time in Berlin there was no man or women who would later distinguish themselves [...] who had not belonged to this circle.‚Äù Significantly, she also emphasizes the fact that her ‚Äúsociety‚Äù was a place where *spiritedness* ( *Geist* ) served to level all distinctions, and the resulting equalization yielded a sort of satire of courtly life, directed ‚Äúagainst the whole class of the high nobility with its cold formality [ *Formalwesen* ].‚Äù The result, at least the intended one, was a group of like-minded individuals committed to the spirited and free exchange of ideas untainted by the sorts of prejudice (especially anti-Semitic) that held sway in broader society:\n\nWhat is then to be wondered that amidst such social relations (or more accurately, mis-relations [ *Mi√üverh√§ltnisse* ], a spiritual society presented itself, an opportunity which, in spite of the predominant prejudice against the Jews at the time, was eagerly snapped up by those who generally sought spiritual cultivation [ *geistige F√∂rderung* ] down the path of a conversational exchange of ideas?\n\nVarnhagen was rather more explicit about the purpose of her salon, particularly the first salon she hosted which ran from the early 1790s until 1806. Convening in her parents‚Äô house over a simple service of tea, Varnhagen‚Äôs salon expressly had sociability as its goal. In a frequently-quoted passage in a later letter, she extols sociability ( *Geselligkeit* ) and its centrality for all human endeavours: sociability, she writes, is\n\n[a]ctually the most human thing among human beings! The sum-total and the origin of everything moral! Without fellows, without companions for earthly existence, we would ourselves not be persons and ethical action, law, or thinking would be impossible without the assumption that another‚Äîthe image of a person‚Äîis like us, that he is *what we are*.\n\nThe central value placed on sociability meant that during her first salon, the emphasis was on wide-ranging conversation and not dramatic readings or the presentation of lectures, which Varnhagen found distasteful. Varnhagen characterizes hers as a ‚Äúfree society,‚Äù and in order to ensure that it promoted the end of sociability, Varnhagen discouraged personal satires and mockery, but sought to ensure that ‚Äúa productive good will‚Äù predominated. Varnhagen‚Äôs salon was especially notable for the wide intermingling between estates that it fostered. Among its guests (a number of whom overlapped with Herz‚Äôs salon) were artists and thinkers (including her brother, Ludwig Robert, and Jean Paul, among others), members of her family and Jewish friends, but also diplomats, officers, and nobility, with whom Varnhagen enjoyed an exceedingly casual *rapport*. An unwelcome and unpleasant baron who threatened to spoil the mood one evening was productively engaged by Varnhagen ‚Äúsimply and well, without apprehension or insincerity,‚Äù while Clemens Brentano reports that, concerning the higher-born guests, including Prince Louis Ferdinand (1772‚Äì1806), Varnhagen ‚Äúdoes not care any more than if they were lieutenants or students [...] they would be equally welcome to her.‚Äù\n\nIn addition to realizing the kind of sociability essential to the promotion of Mendelssohnian culture, both Herz‚Äôs and Varnhagen‚Äôs salons represent a notable extension of Mendelssohn‚Äôs call for intermingling between the estates to include the concourse between the sexes. It is notable in this respect that both Herz and Varnhagen enjoyed an atypically casual relationship with members of the opposite sex. For Herz, this was partly the result of her husband‚Äôs benign unconcern for her, a circumstance that led to Herz having to delicately extricate herself from numerous entanglements with admirers. In Varnhagen‚Äôs case, she points to her unmarried status as removing an obstacle for her to engage with male guests more freely; this is suggested, for instance, when she equates the limitations of the state of marriage with those of membership in a specific estate: ‚Äúan office or estate [ *Amt oder Stand* ] seems to me to be as restricting as a marriage.‚Äù\n\nThis interest in exploring the possibilities of refined, non-romantic concourse between the sexes is likewise behind the rather more experimental *Tugendbund* (compact of virtue), initiated by Herz and Wilhelm von Humboldt, and which included Alexander, as well as Carl von La Roche, and Brendel Veit-Mendelssohn, among others (some of whom were outside of Berlin and were personally unacquainted with Herz). The *Tugenbund* had as its purpose ‚Äúreciprocal moral and spiritual [ *sittliche und geistige* ] development, and the exercise of love in effective works.‚Äù As the participans themselves attested, the *Tugendbund* itself had all the trappings of a formal society (Wilhelm von Humboldt refers to it as a *Loge* or lodge), complete with encrypted letters and a set of statutes, though in contrast with some of these other societies there were no hierarchies observed among those involved as the participants employing the familiar ( *Du* ) form, no matter the relative difference in standing, a circumstance that applied to new members as well as older ones. While the group struck some as a mere forum for half-disguised flirtatious oversharing and as a juvenile pursuit which Herz herself never outgrew (as was suggested by Varnhagen herself, who opted not to join), Herz did credit it for the inspiration of at least one ‚Äúexercise of love in effective works,‚Äù namely, when she took in a child of Jewish beggars who were stranded beyond the gates of Berlin, though she regrets that her efforts to ‚Äúraise [the child] to virtue‚Äù were ultimately unsuccessful. What is, in any case, important is that alongside the crucial role that Herz‚Äôs and Varnhagen‚Äôs salons had in the reception and development of early Romanticism, these experiments in sociability (including the *Tugendbund* ) still have a foot in the 18th century as they serve as prime examples of institutions which fostered and indeed extended the kind of culture which Mendelssohn identified as vital for enlightenment.\n\n3. Education as Vocation: Amalia Holst\n\nReturning to Mendelssohn‚Äôs characterization of enlightenment itself, it will be recalled that the conception of the human being‚Äôs distinctive *vocation* ( *Bestimmung* ) plays a central role. With this phrase, Mendelssohn is obviously invoking a topic that is central to German philosophy and philosophical anthropology throughout the second half of the 18th century. As it was first raised by Johann Joachim Spalding in his treatise *Die Bestimmung des Menschen* (first edition 1748), the question of what the vocation, or destination, of the human being was, concerned first and foremost what the human being might expect in the afterlife, primarily on the basis of a consideration of its complement of natural powers and dispositions. Mendelssohn was quite familiar with this famous work, as is evidenced by an exchange between himself and his friend Thomas Abbt on the topic published in 1764. There, Mendelssohn identifies the human being‚Äôs vocation as follows:\n\nThe *proper* vocation of the human being on this earth, which the foolish and the wise alike fulfill‚Äîalbeit to a different degree‚Äîis hence the *cultivation* [ *Ausbildung* ] *of all faculties of the soul according to divine intentions*, since this is the aim of all their earthly work [ *Verrichtung* ]. (JubA 6.1, 20; EVM 250)\n\nAs we have seen, in the essay on enlightenment, Mendelssohn claims that our vocation, consisting in the development of our faculties, is ‚Äúset as the measure and aim of all our strivings and efforts, like a point to which we must direct our eyes if we would not become lost‚Äù (JubA 6.1, 115-16). This account of the human being‚Äôs vocation *as human being* serves as a crucial frame for Mendelssohn‚Äôs corresponding conception of enlightenment, as it shows that what is constitutive of enlightenment is not the mere ‚Äúacquisition of *information,* ‚Äù in Kant‚Äôs subsequent dismissive formulation (cf. AA 8:146n), but rather the opportunity for the cultivation of the soul‚Äôs faculties that such acquisition affords.\n\nMendelssohn had additionally distingusihed between the vocation of the human being considered, on the one hand, as an individual human being and, on the other, as a citizen ( *B√ºrger* ) which is to say as a ‚Äúmember of a society [ *Mitgliedes der Gesellschaft* ].‚Äù With respect to the latter, the specific set of (cognitive) faculties and dispositions that a human being develops in their pursuit of enlightenment will differ depending on what standing or which profession they hold in a society, whereas the enlightenment that pertains to ‚Äúthe human being as human being‚Äù does not differ according to ‚Äú *Stand* und *Beruf* ‚Äù but pertains to universally shared cognitive capacities and interests (and, presumably, to the dismissal of prejudices to which we are naturally prone). Significantly, Mendelssohn thinks that the fulfillment of our vocation as human beings occurs at the level of the individual rather than of humanity as a whole, a fact made clear in the ensuing correspondence with Abbt.\n\nIn this context of the broader debate relating to Spalding‚Äôs *Bestimmung des Menschen*, Mendelssohn and his contemporaries focused on the question of what, if anything, followed from this claim with respect to our certainty in the existence of God and the afterlife. Yet, as might be clear, Mendelssohn‚Äôs particular conception of the human being‚Äôs vocation has as its distinct implication that education of some sort, through the development of our distinctively human, higher capacities, is necessary for all in order to fulfill this vocation. Given this, it is perhaps odd that Mendelssohn himself never devoted a treatise to education, though he was actively involved in a number of pedagogical projects, including the founding of the first public school for Jewish boys in Berlin, and counted a number of educational innovators among his friends and correspondents, including Johann Bernhard Basedow and Joachim Heinrich Campe. Mendelssohn does touch on the issue in a variety of contexts, however. For instance, in *Jerusalem*, in the course of a discussion of marriage, he contends that through the joint creation of a child, the parents undertake an obligation to educate it:\n\nWhoever helps to beget a being capable of felicity is obligated, by the laws of nature, to promote its felicity, as long as it is not yet able to provide for its own advancement. This is the natural duty of education [ *Erziehung* ] which is, to be sure, only a duty of conscience. Still, by the act itself, the parents have agreed to assist each other in this respect, that is, to discharge together their duty of conscience. (JubA 8, 118-19; JRP 50)\n\nMoreover, Mendelssohn‚Äôs final philosophical work, *Morgenstunden* is itself framed as a set of lectures derived from conversations had with his son, son-in-law (Simon Veit), and a family friend. While his son Joseph (born in 1770), and Bernhard Wessely (born in 1768), son of Aron Wessely, were fairly young at the time of the original morning conversations, the topics covered include a refutation of Kantian idealism, a refutation of Spinozistic pantheism, and a novel proof of God‚Äôs existence. This is perhaps less surprising, given that Mendelssohn‚Äôs children, including his three daughters, had by all accounts the benefit of a thorough education.\n\nThis connection between the conception of the human vocation in terms of the development of our higher capacities and the issue of education was clearly recognized by Amalia Holst (1758‚Äì1829), who in her self-identification as a ‚Äúpractical educator [ *praktische Erzieherin* ]‚Äù engaged in a thorough criticism of the philosophical foundations and applicability of modern educational theories. In her (anonymously published) *Bemerkungen √ºber die Fehler unserer modernen Erziehung* ( *Observations on the Mistakes of our modern Education* ) of 1791, she takes aim specifically at Basedow and Campe whose ambitious pedagogy sought to replace the emphasis on rote memorization of useless material with a wide-ranging education in the sciences, religion, and morality with the aim of training useful citizens. This was accomplished through the publication of textbooks, including model conversations between pupil and instructor as well as a wealth of visual aids, and through the use of (sometimes competitive) games particularly for the mastery of languages. While Holst shares Basedow‚Äôs and Campe‚Äôs reservations regarding the old methods, she charges them with an over-correction; so, while memorization had the effect of making students content with a superficial sort of learning that did not penetrate to its source,\n\nmodern education has fallen into the opposite error, [namely] it leads the pupil to the source [ *Quelle* ] too early, from which they can take as much as they want, but unused to this heady brew they become drunk at first and think themselves able to hold their own with anyone; but habituation soon dulls the effect and, as they still have no feeling for the truly beautiful and useful, they grow to neglect and despise them and rush to the next stream without ever bothering to return.\n\nAccording to Holst, then, modern educational practices promotes the development of harmful drives and passions among students, including obstinancy (as in the above case), vanity and self-conceit (through competitive learning), and an imagination over-heated by the images of the divine presented in the textbooks. On this last point in particular, Holst approvingly cites ‚Äúthe blessed Mendelssohn‚Äù who had also denounced the inclination to render supersensible things sensible in the preface to his *Morgenstunden*.\n\nBehind Holst‚Äôs criticisms of modern education lies a conception of the human being‚Äôs vocation similar to Mendelssohn‚Äôs, though Holst thinks that recognizing this has distinct implications for our pedagogical presuppositions and practices. So, she recognizes the importance of education for cultivating the child‚Äôs intellect and will, but contends that the wide range and abstract character of the topics treated by modern educators, as well as the reliance upon argumentation, are poorly suited to the stage of development of the child‚Äôs powers and dispositions. As she notes, these modern educators wrongly presume that their pupils dispose over distinct conceptions of the subject matter and seek to lead them to various conclusions through the use of long chains of inference they are unable to follow. Notably, Holst‚Äôs criticism here might even be extended to Mendelssohn‚Äôs own pedagogical activity with respect to his young audience in the conversations at the basis of the *Morgenstunden*, though she refrains from pointing this out herself. In any case, this has the effect of rushing the child‚Äôs maturation, forcing their intellectual development beyond its natural pace and leading to the generation of passions that they are poorly equipped to handle, a circumstance that leads Holst to compare children educated in the modern fashion to plants in a hothouse as they are forced to grow quickly and ripen too early. Holst chalks this failing on the part of modern educators up to their bent towards theory rather than practice, and to a neglect to observe carefully the children who they will be shaping. Had they done so, rather than ‚Äúbeing unable to move quickly enough in teaching students in the elements of all sciences as soon as possible‚Äù they would instead have recognized the wisdom of their own advice that ‚Äúwith a child, the enlightenment of the understanding must be pursued only very slowly‚Äù and through ‚Äúlessons that are accommodated to the capacities of the child.‚Äù\n\nWith Holst‚Äôs *√úber die Bestimmung des Weibes zur h√∂hern Geistesbildung* ( *On the Vocation of Women for a higher Education* ) of 1802, the implicit reliance in the *Bemerkungen* upon the conception of the vocation of the human being as consisting in the individual development of higher capacities becomes explicit. Early in the treatise, for instance, she claims that nature‚Äôs purpose with respect to humanity was ‚Äúto endow us with enough dispositions and powers so that we can develop [ *ausbilden* ] them and thereby transition to a condition of culture.‚Äù Moreover, the right of every human being to education is directly a function of our duty to fulfill this purpose:\n\nall higher education of the human being, and consequently also of women, must flow from the all-encompassing and true source, as a duty of humanity to develop all of his powers and to contribute to the well-being of the whole as an active member. Therefore the ennobling of ourselves, and co-operation in the great plan of the author of nature, is our purpose.\n\nAs should also be clear, Holst now makes the case for women‚Äôs right to education in particular, and indeed she does so in terms familiar from Mendelssohn‚Äôs essay on enlightenment. In doing so, she pointedly does not challenge the traditional conception of women‚Äôs vocation in terms of the threefold occupations of *Gattin*, *Mutter*, and *Hausfrau*, but she does banish these to what Mendelssohn would call the ‚Äúextra-essential determinations‚Äù of woman‚Äôs vocation, emphasizing instead that women, as human beings, should also be recognized as entitled to enlightenment to the same extent as men considered as such. She writes that\n\n[o]nly in the first obligation of human beings, which demands that we develop [ *auszubilden* ] all of our powers in the most beautiful harmony towards the highest perfection, will we all be free. Here we share in the same rights, and this duty binds us as well as men. Before we are man or woman, male or female citizen of a nation, husband or wife, we are human beings.\n\nIn this way, Holst appropriates the core distinctions in Mendelssohn‚Äôs account‚Äîbetween our vocations as human beings and as citizens, and between essential and extra-essential determinations‚Äîand the presumed priority of the former in each case in order to unlock the emancipatory potential of this conception of enlightenment for women. For his own part, Mendelssohn did not explicitly (or implicitly) exclude women from among the subjects of enlightenment; nonetheless, Holst now makes it clear that gender is to be considered among the human being‚Äôs ‚Äòextra-essential‚Äô determinations when it comes to the issue of our essential vocation as human beings: ‚Äú[we] must, as thinking beings, completely abstract from what pertains to us as women [ *ganz vom Weibe abstrahiren* ], and merely consider ourselves as humans, that is, as perfectible beings.‚Äù\n\n4. Elise Reimarus and the Advance of Enlightenment\n\nThe previous discussion, of course, raises the issue of how to act in cases of conflict between our interest in enlightenment and our duties as citizens of a state. Mendelssohn‚Äôs contention that deference should be shown to the regime in conflicts between what the regime deems to be central to its subjects and what reason determines to be essential to us as human beings proved to be controversial. Mendelssohn‚Äôs own view, of course, should be situated within the context of his *Jerusalem* and the strict exclusion of the state (and religion) from authority over matters of conscience, but even so among some of his friends, Mendelssohn‚Äôs position was taken to validate the toleration of harmful prejudice that stood in the way of the progress of enlightenment. In a letter in response to Mendelssohn‚Äôs essay, August Hennings (1746‚Äì1826), an envoy of the Danish court in Berlin and (later) Saxony, and an enthusiastic *Aufkl√§rer*, denied the possibility of such a conflict, at least provided that our enlightenment as citizens is not to have any meaning:\n\nThe opposite of enlightenment is delusion [ *Verblendung* ], active or passive, barbarousness, or stupidity. In such a conflict, therefore, the human being would have to be misled by barbarousness or preserved in a state of unknowing. Here, God would be put in contradiction with Himself. He would have put a power into some just so that it could be rendered impotent or inactive in commerce with others. If it is not to come to that, then the constitution of the state [ *B√ºrgerliche Verfassung* ] must be unjust, and we could no longer call it the enlightenment but rather the delusion of the citizen. Thus, no conflict is possible (JubA 13, 228-9)\n\nIn response to this uncompromising approach to the progress of enlightenment‚Äîone that seeks the immediate eradication of all prejudice and denies the possibility of any abuse of enlightenment‚ÄîMendelssohn advises the need for forbearance and even toleration of prejudice, lest the would-be enlightener harms their own cause. Thus, he claims, the enlightener must ‚Äúobserve the time and circumstances carefully, and only raise the curtain in those respects in which the light would be salutary to the sick,‚Äù and even confesses that, if he had the power to uncover all prejudice ‚Äúwith a single stroke of the pen,‚Äù he would be loathe to do so (JubA 13, 237).\n\nAs it happens, the contrasting positions here set out by Mendelssohn and Hennings relating to how, and how fast, enlightenment should advance are only the late developments of an ongoing discussion on the topic between the two, a discussion that was notably also engaged by Elise Reimarus (1735-1805), an admirer and correspondent of Mendelssohn‚Äôs, and Hennings‚Äô close friend and sister-in-law. Reimarus was a central figure in Hamburg intellectual life from the 1770s onwards, in no small measure due to the ‚Äútea table [ *Teetisch* ]‚Äù that she co-hosted (with Hennings‚Äô sister, Sophie) and which counted Klopstock, Campe, and F. H. Jacobi among its guests, and provided a forum for discussion of leading literary and philosophical works, including plays by Lessing (who was, as it were, a corresponding member of the group). Reimarus‚Äô own literary activity included works for the stage and pedagogical texts (including the sorts of model conversations criticized by Holst), though she would be best known for her involvment in the two major intellectual controversies of her time: the *Fragmentenstreit* (Fragment controversy), involving Lessing and a radical deistic text written by her father, and the *Pantheismusstreit* (Pantheism controversy), between Jacobi and Mendelssohn relating to the former‚Äôs report that Lessing had confessed himself a Spinozist. As is particularly evident in her correspondence relating to the former controversy, Reimarus developed and honed a distinctive and consistent position relating to the advance of enlightenment.\n\nThe Fragment controversy relates to a manuscript written by the orientalist and philosopher Hermann Samuel Reimarus (1694-1768), entitled the *Apologie oder Schutzschrift f√ºr die vern√ºnftigen*\n\n*Verehrer Gottes* ( *Apology for the those who honour God rationally* ) in which he, among other things, disputes the authority of Scripture as a source of revelation and outlines a conspiracy among Jesus‚Äôs disciples at the origin of Christianity. The manuscript came into Lessing‚Äôs hands in 1770 or 1771‚Äîand it is now thought that Elise Reimarus was the driving force in delivering it to him‚Äîand in 1774 he began publishing a series of ‚Äúfragments of an unknown‚Äù from the manuscript, a circumstance made possible through his position as director of the ducal library in Wolfenb√ºttel (which exempted him from the censor). The first fragment (‚ÄúOn the Toleration of Deists,‚Äù 1774) elicited little in the way of response, a fact that disappointed Lessing. A series of publications in 1777 of the most inflammatory sections, along with his critical commentary (and an excerpt from his own *Erziehung des Menschengeschlechts*, without identifying himself as the author), did provoke the opposition of orthodox Lutheran theologians with whom Lessing traded publications through to 1780, but which ultimately saw the manuscript confiscated, the exemption from censorship revoked, and Lessing forbidden to publish on theological topics (and at one point threated with further sanction from the imperial *Corpus Evangelicorum* ).\n\nWhatever Lessing‚Äôs intentions in stoking the controversy, Elise Reimarus‚Äô interest was to strike a blow in the ‚Äúfight against the repression of reason and human freedom‚Äù through the publication of her father‚Äôs radical views, which she shared (possibly even going further than him in some doctrines). Even so, Reimarus recognized from the outset that caution had to be exercised, not only because of her family‚Äôs potential exposure, but also and especially because proceeding too hastily might have the opposite effect. She reports in a letter to Hennings that in an early discussion concerning how best to publish the *Apologie*, she initially resisted publication altogether, given that in her opinion, ‚Äúthe making-known of certain things, and the dispelling of prejudices, always happens too early or too late.‚Äù It does not seem that Reimarus had any say in the matter in the end, as Lessing first attempted to publish the manuscript in its entirety before turning to the publication of fragments, but in any case Reimarus would defend Lessing‚Äôs eventual strategy to Hennings, who, unsurprisingly, advocated for a more straightforward way of proceeding. Foremost among Reimarus‚Äô reasons for approval of the piecemeal strategy, is that the publication of the manuscript in its entirety would make it likely that the author would suffer the same fate as other radical thinkers, like Tindal, who stepped forward fully with their works, namely, that of being simply ‚Äúprinted, denounced, and forgotten.‚Äù Lessing has thus provided, through the faceless Fragmentist, the opportunity for the public‚Äôs durable engagement with the truth, rather than inviting immediate proscription from those authorities hostile to enlightenment. Against Hennings, who advocates for ‚Äúthe open, frank, heroic love of truth,‚Äù Reimarus thus prefers in these times of division, the ‚Äúgradual undermining of the edifice‚Äù which, like the full-frontal assault proposed by Hennings, promises its eventual and total destruction, but bears a better chance of lasting success such that ‚Äúno hope can remain for rebuilding it.‚Äù\n\nWhat in any case becomes clear through Reimarus‚Äô involvement in the Fragment controversy is that, like Mendelssohn, she thinks that the advance of enlightenment must be pursued cautiously and with a close eye on the general and local circumstances. Notably, Reimarus would come to share some of Hennings‚Äô concerns in light of the uproar that resulted from the publication of the second fragment in 1777, conceding that they should have adopted the ‚Äúdirect route [ *den geraden Weg* ]‚Äù from the outset. Even in this distance-taking, however, her frustration should be understood as directed at Lessing‚Äôs own unhelpful interventions into the affair through his dissenting commentary, his insertion of his own disguised and highly ‚Äúconfusing‚Äù speculations, and the distracting sideshow of bitter polemics. In her later verdict, Reimarus realises that ‚Äúa mask like Lessing‚Äôs is least suited to the truth,‚Äù and indeed, this disappointment is entirely a function of her worry that the best chance for the *Apologie* to have the desired effect on the public has been, as a result of the transformation of the controversy into a personal dispute, irretrievably lost.\n\nAnd yet, despite also rejecting Hennings‚Äô more extreme approach, which Mendelssohn pointedly characterizes as amounting to a ‚Äúprejudice against prejudice,‚Äù Reimarus‚Äô views on the advance of enlightenment are to be distinguished from Mendelssohn‚Äôs more concessive approach. This departure is evident in her role in connection with her activity relating to Mendelssohn‚Äôs new translation of the Pentateuch, for the advertisement of which a pamphlet was circulated in 1778. A rumoured ban of the translation on the part of the Jewish community in Altona precipated a discussion of prejudice and the limits of toleration among Mendelssohn, Hennings, and Reimarus. Mendelssohn, after floating an uncharacteristically intolerant query about whether state police might limit the proselytizing of a tolerated minority (which provoked a strong dissent from Reimarus), adopted the rather more characteristic position that prejudices should be tolerated, can often be corrected by other prejudices (in the way an initial reckoning error might be offset by a subsequent one), and indeed, may sometimes even be indispensable. At this juncture, Reimarus, who had been mediating the correspondence, intervened with a letter to Mendelssohn in which she expresses her agreement that prejudice is to some extent ineradicable, and concedes that Hennings‚Äô position of a general crusade against prejudice is ‚Äúchimerical,‚Äù but nonetheless stresses that the responsibility of combatting them remains:\n\nBut how? Not through fire and sword, but rather insofar as one exposes them, as much as possible, to the light of truth which they cannot bear [...]. If, then, I say: I wish to utterly uproot prejudices, I understand by this that one should strive as far as possible for distinct concepts, seek as far as possible the highest degree of truth and spread its light.\n\nThus, against Mendelssohn who, as Altmann has noted had long cherished the idea that ‚Äúin certain instances prejudice might be preferable to enlightenment,‚Äù Reimarus contends that in spite of the unavoidability of prejudice, and in spite of some prejudices being harmless or even capturing some of the truth, it remains the task of the enlightener to proactively, but prudently, set themselves in opposition to them.\n\nThis policy of cautious but persistent advancement is evident in Reimarus‚Äô activity in the Fragment controversy, though not only there. So, we have seen, her initial hesitation to publish the full *Apologie* had to do with her concern that the text would be decried and forgotten without effect, a concern that Lessing‚Äôs strategy successfully (initially, at least) mitigated. For Reimarus, then, the inclination was consistently in favour of putting the radical text in the hands of the public in a form in which it could most effectively do the work of dispelling the prejudices fomented by the defenders of organized (and revealed) religion. Yet, this attitude of cautiously but consistently advancing enlightenment can also be discerned in her activity in the context of the Pantheism controversy. Reimarus does not shy away from Lessing‚Äôs alleged Spinozism; rather, she greets Jacobi‚Äôs report with some relief since she had heard reports that he had inclined towards rather more ‚Äúsuperstitious‚Äù practices in his last days, though she adopts the prudent course of action in submitting it to Mendelssohn who is better placed to judge ‚Äúwhether the public should be allowed to know it or not‚Äù (in his planned work on Lessing‚Äôs character) (JubA 13, 120-1). Reimarus also seems to relish her role as the arbiter of the (at that point private) debate between the two relating to the truth and nature of Lessing‚Äôs Spinozism, though she indicates later that Jacobi‚Äôs Lessing ‚Äúseemed truer and therefore appealed more‚Äù to her. Even her shock at Jacobi‚Äôs publication of the correspondence between them and Mendelssohn can be explained through her disappointment, similar to that felt in the course of the Fragment controversy, that the inclusion of material relating to Lessing‚Äôs private interactions with his friends would distract from the larger issue of his Spinozism; thus, she felt a deep concern that ‚Äúa contest over the truth [ *Wettstreit um die Wahrheit* ] [...] could now become a private quarrel [ *Privatstreit* ] in which only Lessings enemies and the enemies of truth might win.‚Äù\n\nThis view on the appropriate way to advance enlightenment arguably also informs Reimarus‚Äô political thought, outlined in an unpublished manuscript thought to be written between 1789 and 1792. There, she identifies the jurisdiction of state authority as extending (only) to ‚Äúexternal right,‚Äù or that aspect of those actions that might impinge on others‚Äô action and omission, but rather than strictly separting this from the inner domain of conscience (as Mendelssohn does), such that political life might be insulated from (private) enlightenment, Reimarus instead emphasizes the necessity for the enlightened individual to guide and inform the policies of the state:\n\nThe *morally* and *psychologically* necessary conditions of a higher degree of political perfection are public consensus [ *Uberzeugung* ], lead by *Selbstdenker* who are morally-disposed [ *moralisch gesinnte* ], and a set of customs that are supported by rationality in policy and the rearing of children [ *Kinderzucht* ].\n\nGiven the indispensability of such active *Selbstdenker*, Reimarus claims that any enlightenment that is limited merely to the sphere of external action is ‚Äúabsurd and pernicious,‚Äù as ‚Äúexternal freedom is only the means *of the internal* and a mere condition of moral culture.‚Äù On account of her conception of the relation between the spheres of morality and right, Reimarus is sometimes compared to Kant (either in terms of offering an alternative, Kantian view or alternative to the Kantian view). Without denying the appropriateness or the fruitfulness of such a comparison, it should now also be clear that there is also a relevant context (and important foil) for the development of her views in her engagement with Mendelssohn.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs I hope to have shown, shifting focus to Mendelssohn‚Äôs conception of enlightenment has the effect of acknowledging the importance of diverse forms of (historically female) intellectuality and sociality, foregrounding philosophical topics of particular interest to women, and revealing women to be active participants in discussions of central importance to the Enlightenment. Indeed, we have seen that the women considered above did not content themselves with implementing Mendelssohn‚Äôs views but instead actively and critically engaged with them, frequently in ways that served to extend them to enhance their inclusivity (of women in particular). This was the case for Herz‚Äôs and Varnhagen‚Äôs efforts to expand women‚Äôs role in promoting the flourishing of culture (while also testing and revising the boundaries between the sexes), for Holst‚Äôs attempts to realise the emancipatory potential in the notion of the vocation of a human being as a human being and furnish it with an appropriately ambitious theory of education, and finally for Reimarus‚Äô forthright account of the responsibility of the would-be enlightener to gradually but decisively persist in undermining the edifice of prejudice that stands in the way of enlightenment. It is, in retrospect, unsurprising that the conception of enlightenment framed by Mendelssohn, who like the women profiled here did not enjoy the privileges of citizenship nor regular access to the institutions of education, should have this distinctively inclusive character; what is surprising is that it has been and continues to be neglected by historians of philosophy and of the Enlightenment more generally in spite of this considerable virtue.\n\nBibliography\n\nAbbt, Thomas and Moses Mendelssohn. ‚ÄúExchange on the Vocation of Man.‚Äù Translated by Anne Pollok. *Graduate Faculty Philosophy Journal* 39.1 (2018): 237-61.\n\nAlexander, Gerhard. ‚ÄúWie kam Lessing zur Handschrift der Wolfenb√ºtteler Fragmente?‚Äù *Philobiblon.

        "user_prompt": "Philosophy paper text:\n## Heidegger and The Occlusion of the Political\n\n## By\n\n## SACHA GOLOB (King's College London)\n\n## Forthcoming in\n\nGeschichte, Politik, Ideologie: Heideggers,Schwarze Hefte' im Kontext, Espinet, Figal, Keiling and Mirkovic (eds.), Mohr Siebeck.\n\n## Penultimate Draft - Please Cite the Published Version\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis paper aims to advance our understanding of Heidegger's politics as it is laid bare within the'Schwarze Hefte '. Yet my interest is not in Heidegger's first order political views, but rather in his conception of the political sphere per se. Beginning from a close analysis of the earliest volume of the notebooks, Gesamtausgabe Bd.94, I suggest that the dominant characterisation of the political space within Heidegger's text is as a threat - to philosophy and to ontology. Underlying that characterisation, however, it is simultaneously possible to identify another pattern, one on which the political is itself gradually suppressed or occluded by the ontological. This tacit occlusion has, I suggest, a number of deeply problematic consequences. I close by indicating how the argument might be extended to the question of a Heideggerian ethics.\n\nMy aim in this paper is to advance our understanding of Heidegger's politics as it is laid bare within the so-called'Schwarze Hefte '. But my interest is not in his first order political views nor in his prejudices, which seem to me as predictable as they are repulsive. Rather, my interest is in his conception of the political sphere per se, and in his understanding of the relationship between philosophy and politics as two fields of discourse or action. I want to approach the topic with the help of a figure that is, I hope, useful, although provocative.\n\nFigure A\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI am going to use this diagram to think through the relationship between the concepts located at each corner. 1 The figure is provocative because the diagram is obviously utterly vague one's immediate response is to ask what is meant by the terms listed. But that is also why the figure is helpful - it triggers a demand for clarification within a context orientated around the interaction of the three points. For all its crudity, such a diagram thus serves to highlight a philosophically vital dimension. Consider, for example, the case of Kant. The Kantian system employs a number of highly sophisticated devices to manage the interaction between the triangle's points. At the macro-level, there is the distinction between theoretical and practical reason, which is designed to mediate the interaction of (I) and (III). 2 There is also the ceaselessly rearticulated distinction between virtue and right - this is designed to simultaneously separate and yet connect (II) and (III), and one of the distinctive features of the Metaphysics of Morals is its continual, non-equivalent, attempts to spell this out. 3 At the micro-level, the interaction of the points is handled by projects such as Kant's idiosyncratic manual for pedagogy, with its complex choreography of question and silence. 4 In the case of\n\n1 The very geometry of this figure is, of course, an almost intolerable echo of the history at stake in this debate; but that is a discussion for another paper.\n\n2 IMMANUEL KANT, Kritik der reinenVernunft.

For example, consider the tradition running from Hegel through Foucault which seeks to rethink the conjunction or disjunction at (III), and to go on from that to transform the connections between (II) and (III). Here the issues will in part be those of translation in the deepest sense: how, for example, does the distinction between'Moralit√§t'and'Sittlichkeit'map to one between'la morale'and'l'√©thique '?\n\nMy purpose in this essay is to use first volume of the so called'Schwarze Hefte ', published as Gesamtausgabe Bd.94 and covering 1931-1938, to shed some light on how Heidegger himself understood this triangle. I confine my analysis to this single volume for two reasons. First, it covers the period of his most overt political involvement, the Rectorship. Second, I want to pay close attention to the dynamics of Heidegger's text - to include the later volumes of the notebooks, I would need not only to dilute that focus but also to digress into discussion of the broader changes within Heidegger's philosophy during the 1930s and 1940s. So my focus will be largely on GA94. My aim is to use that text in order to analyse Heidegger's conception of the political and his understanding of how the political interacts with ontology and with ethics. In other words, how does point (II) of my diagram relate to points (I) and (III)? Once that is done, I will close by discussing briefly the relationship between points (I) and (III) themselves.\n\nThree remarks on scope and definitions before proceeding. First, as in the paragraph preceding this, I will talk of'ethics' rather than'morality' when discussing (III) in a Heideggerian context. By'ethics' I mean those general normative considerations, whatever they may be, that define the good life; I prefer this to'morality' since the latter term often calls to mind specifically deontological or rule-based normative systems. 5 Second, whilst any examination of Heidegger's conception of the political ultimately needs to be embedded within a broader treatment of Sein und Zeit's views on'√ñffentlichkeit'or'Das Man ', a direct engagement with that text is beyond this piece. 6 Third, I will use'ontology' broadly to mean any philosophical reflection on appropriate and inappropriate views of being. I will mark Heidegger's own distinctive take on being, whether that be'Sein'or'Seyn ', by use of an initial capital letter: 'Being'. I am not going to discuss exactly how Heidegger tries to cash the relevant notions of'the appropriate' or'inappropriate' in this period; that would\n\n5 I began by including the reference to'morality' in order to allow me to discuss Kant, a thinker who provides a useful illustration of the triangle's importance.\n\n6 For my own views on those concepts, please see SACHA GOLOB, Heidegger on Concepts, Freedom and Normativity, Cambridge, 2014, Ch. 6.\n\nrequire close analysis of concepts such'Ereignis'and'Anfang '. My interest is rather in how Heidegger construes the relation between an appropriate stance on Being - whatever exactly that should be - and the question of politics. As I will discuss, Heidegger also often uses '' Ontologie '' in scare quotes to mark misguided views on the topic.\n\n## (1) Politics as a Threat to Ontology within GA94\n\nThe question I want to begin with is a deceptively simple one: 'what is the political?'. 7 As noted, my concern is not with Heidegger's first order politics, but with his understanding of the political sphere per se. What if anything, for example, marks the boundary between a political conversation and a philosophical one? I will now argue that GA94 primarily characterises the political in terms of threat. This can be seen at both a general and a more specific level, and I will take each in turn.\n\nWhatever else it may be, the political sphere is necessarily a public sphere - one can then gloss that public sphere in terms of power, management of competing interests, giving and exchanging reasons, and so on depending upon one's further views. What is immediately striking in GA94, however, is its repeated focus on the negative dynamics of the public sphere, and on the attendant problems facing action or discourse within it. In short, Heidegger's view of the basic architecture of the political in GA94 is a negative one. His worries are articulated simultaneously along aesthetic, epistemological and sociological lines: the public sphere is noisy, 8 quick and busy, 9 posturing [ Getue ], 10 superficial and deceptive, a place of figleaves and veneers [ Deckmantel;Anstrich ] 11, misled and stubborn, 12 and characterised by the consumerist logic of the marketplace. 13 These predicates are, of course, in large part simply the reverse image of those which Heidegger himself valorises: contemporary politics is defined by the'loudspeaker', whereas Heidegger himself valorises silence. 14 The result is a discourse on politics that interweaves first order cultural gripes with\n\n7 MARTIN HEIDEGGER, √úberlegungen II-VI (Schwarze Hefte 1931-1938), Gesamtausgabe (hereinafter GA) Bd.\n\n94, Frankfurt am Main, 2014, p. 58.\n\n8 HEIDEGGER, Schwarze Hefte 1931-1938, GA94, pp. 163-4; 245.\n\n9 HEIDEGGER, Schwarze Hefte 1931-1938, GA94, p. 122; 159-160; 170.\n\n10 HEIDEGGER, Schwarze Hefte 1931-1938, GA94, p. 146.\n\n11 HEIDEGGER, Schwarze Hefte 1931-1938, GA94, p. 147; 133.\n\n12 HEIDEGGER, Schwarze Hefte 1931-1938, GA94, p. 174.\n\n13 HEIDEGGER, Schwarze Hefte 1931-1938, GA94, p. 140.\n\n14 HEIDEGGER, Schwarze Hefte 1931-1938, GA94, p. 245. Compare MARTIN HEIEGGER, Sein und Zeit,\n\nT√ºbingen, 1957, p. 273.\n\nHeidegger's own systematic, philosophical, concerns. So, for example, whilst he is excited by the energy with which students have engaged in the'new politics', he is worried than his own ability to guide debate, will be blocked by a political climate that privileges youth and that demands rapidly implementable policies when genuine progress takes decades or even centuries. 15 The temporal dynamics and rhythms of the political sphere are thus inherently at odds, he suggests, with those of philosophy. This same worry is clearly visible even at the zenith of his own political intervention, in the Rekoratsrede\n\nBut if the Greeks took three centuries just to put the question of what knowledge is upon the right basis and on a secure path, we have no right to presume that the elucidation and unfolding of the essence of the German university could take place in the current or in the coming semester. 16\n\nHeidegger's basically negative presentation of the political sphere in GA94 is further articulated along three axes, and it is to these I now want to turn. First, he identifies a series of sites and institutions which sustain and concentrate the problematic tendencies just sketched. Many of these are the standard targets of the period, such as democratic decisionmaking bodies or newspapers. 17 Journalism, for example, figures as both driving the degeneration of philosophy and as an endpoint to which philosophy risks being reduced. 18\n\nSecond, the public sphere is in an important sense incorrigible: it absorbs and redirects any attempt to correct it. Within GA94, this underlying worry, building on Heidegger's early work on'idle talk' [ Gerede ], becomes enmeshed with the problematic reception of his own thought. Whatever philosophical innovation is introduced, public discourse simply appropriates it, sloganizes it and thus robs it of significance and power to change the status quo. Heidegger gives as examples of this trend everything from current discussions of'Existenzphilosophie'to '' Ontologie '' (note the scare quote as mentioned above). 19 To introduce a biological metaphor that will prove important later, Heidegger sees the public sphere and the political acts and discourses that take place within it as both diseased and yet as protected by a perverse immunity: all attempts at a cure are simply coopted by the target.\n\n15 HEIDEGGER, Schwarze Hefte 1931-1938, GA94, p. 158; 122.\n\n16 MARTIN HEIDEGGER, The Self-Assertion of the German University, translated by Karsten Harries in: The Review of Metaphysics 38/3 (1985), pp. 467-502, here p. 478.\n\n17 HEIDEGGER, Schwarze Hefte 1931-1938, GA94, p. 151; 22-3.\n\n18 HEIDEGGER, Schwarze Hefte 1931-1938, GA94, pp. 222-3; 380.\n\n19 HEIDEGGER, Schwarze Hefte 1931-1938, GA94, p. 19; 22; 10; 44.\n\nThe third axis shaping Heidegger's discussion concerns the scope of his misgivings. Whilst many philosophers assume some form of distinction between what the early moderns called the'vulgar' and the'learned', Heidegger sees the same negative political dynamics at play in the academy as in the public square. So, for example, he views scholarly exegesis of Sein und Zeit's links to Kierkegaard as a derailment device, a form of the perverse immunity just sketched by which academics serve to distract both themselves and the public from the book's real import. 20 Again, this reflects a longstanding trend within Heidegger's thought GA20, the lecture course from 1925 entitled'Geschichte des Zeitbegriffs ', presents academic conferences per se as devices for'covering up' ideas through parroting them out. 21\n\nMy aim so far has been to outline the structurally negative view of the public sphere, and thus of politics, which characterises the first volume of the'Schwarze Hefte '. I want now to introduce the more specific dimensions of the threat Heidegger sees politics as posing. In doing so, I am going to begin to introduce the question of the relationship between ontology and politics, points (I) and (II) of the diagram with which I began.\n\nThroughout GA94, Heidegger worries about the relationship between the contemporary political scene and the demands of philosophy. The danger comes from'the ceaseless'politicization' of all'sciences''. 22 Elsewhere, he talks of the pernicious'new 'slogan'' that science must be practical, rather than'mere talk', and he links this with the broader programme pushed by the Party. 23 The threat is that politics will increasingly reconfigure philosophy in terms of its own agenda; this will take place, Heidegger suspects, under the banner of promoting'lebensnaher'research. 24 Within such a framework, philosophy would be reduced to'a mere tool' [ Werkzeug ], to be measured by its ability to generate socio-economic'impact' [ Wirkung ]. 25 In short, such politics risks'a blind infantilization of the university' and the'destruction of every genuine knowing'. 26 It is a'path to barbarism'. 27\n\n20 HEIDEGGER, Schwarze Hefte 1931-1938, GA94, p. 74; see similarly p. 39.\n\n21 MARTIN HEIDEGGER, Prolegomena zur Geschichte des Zeitbegriffs, GA20, Frankfurt am Main, 1994, p. 376.\n\n22 HEIDEGGER, Schwarze Hefte 1931-1938, GA94, p. 302 [' die restlose &lt;Politisierung&gt; aller &lt;Wissenschaften&gt; ]'.\n\n23 HEIDEGGER, Schwarze Hefte 1931-1938, GA94, p. 175; 188.\n\n24 HEIDEGGER, Schwarze Hefte 1931-1938, GA94, p. 222; 183.\n\n25 HEIDEGGER, Schwarze Hefte 1931-1938, GA94, p. 222; 64.\n\n26 HEIDEGGER, Schwarze Hefte 1931-1938, GA94, p. 183. As one can clearly see from the remainder of this passage, Heidegger is using Wissen and Wissenschaft here as positive terms - they alone support the right relationship to'Seyn '.\n\n27 HEIDEGGER, Schwarze Hefte 1931-1938, GA94, p. 116.\n\nFor Heidegger this specific threat is ultimately a symptom of the broader trend towards technologization, and the construal of everything as a potential resource. 28 But it is striking how vividly the political comes to symbolise this underlying current. Consider, for example, the way he returns to newspapers, one of the key sites of the problematic political discourse. Within a technological framework, GA65 suggests:\n\nThe historical human sciences become newspaper science. The natural sciences become machine science. 'Newspaper' and'machine' are meant essentially as the dominant ways of ultimate objectification. 29\n\nJournalism thus both enacts and exemplifies the process of objectification.\n\nI have focussed so far on the threat posed by the political to philosophy. But what exactly is it that is so under threat? What special role fulfilled by philosophy stands at risk? This is a question which Heidegger explicitly thematises throughout GA94. The issue is quite simply: '[w]hy is philosophy necessary and what are its limits?'. 30 Heidegger's answer is absolutely clear - the fundamental task of philosophy is to sustain, articulate and empower [ erm√§chtigen ] a distinctive relationship to Being [' Sein'or'Seyn ']. 31 At its proper end, exactly as at its beginning, philosophy remains'the question of the truth of being [ Wahrheit des Seyns ]. 32 By extension, humanity must become the'guardian of the truth of Being' [ der Mensch der Wahrer der Wahrheit des Seyns werden muss ]. 33 There are, of course, numerous changes over the period from 1931 to 1938 in how exactly Heidegger thinks about Being. Many of these are exemplified in the switches between the modern and the archaic spellings of the term: for the reasons which I gave in the introduction I cannot trace them here. Furthermore, he is undoubtedly suspicious of'ontology' in at least some senses of that term, and of the way ontology has been tied to a certain kind of theory: as noted, he typically marks the point by using scare quotes to talk of '' Ontologie ''. But I think that if one is willing to allow, as Heidegger himself has done since the early 1920s, a certain breadth to the term'ontology' we can now make an important point. The fundamental characterisation of the political in GA94 is as a threat; a threat manifest at both a general and a specific level. What it threatens is the distinctive role of philosophy, a role which centres on philosophy's connection to Being. This point holds irrespective of the changing details of how exactly\n\n28 HEIDEGGER, Schwarze Hefte 1931-1938, GA94, p. 295; 472.\n\n29 MARTIN HEIDEGGER, Beitr√§ge zur Philosophie (Vom Ereignis), GA65, Frankfurt am Main, 2003, p. 158\n\n30 HEIDEGGER, Schwarze Hefte 1931-1938, GA94, p. 221.\n\n31 HEIDEGGER, Schwarze Hefte 1931-1938, GA94, p. 29; 31; 36; 39; 54; 92; 221; 232; 272; 332.\n\n32 HEIDEGGER, Schwarze Hefte 1931-1938, GA94, p. 119.\n\n33 HEIDEGGER, Schwarze Hefte 1931-1938, GA94, p. 332.\n\nHeidegger construes this connection: for example in terms of Seinsgeschehnis or Ereignis. 34 To return to our diagram, philosophy is aligned with ontology, at least that is ontology properly practised, and politics is treated as a threat to such ontology. We have, in short, an initial account of the relationship between points (I) and (II).\n\n## (2) Heidegger's Response to the Threat of the Political\n\nI argued above that the dominant presentation of the political within GA94 is as a threat - at both a general and a specific level, Heidegger presents the political as threatening philosophy, and the unique relationship to Being which philosophy sustains. Before developing this point, I want to briefly sketch the three strategies employed by GA94 to deal with the danger posed by the political\n\nThe first strategy is one of disengagement from the public sphere. Perhaps, Heidegger muses, 'thinking within another beginning' simply cannot occur in a public space regulated by the type of self-immunising banality I sketched above. 35 After all, given what he sees as the utterly blinkered reception of his own earlier work, its typecasting simply as '' Existenzphilosophie '', it may be'time to withdraw from the public sphere'. 36 This mood also finds expression in his attempts to valorise the'uselessness' of philosophy, its utter inutility for the type of quantitative'resource-calculus' that he opposes. 37\n\nThe second tactic is more aggressive. Here Heidegger uses the hermeneutic methodology articulated in Sein und Zeit to go on the offensive against the ideology behind the political fantasy of a '' lebensnah '' ' or '' wirklichkeitsnah '' philosophy: his point is that the advocates of such an approach have failed to think through the ideas of life or impact which their rhetoric assumes. 38 The result is these ideas are crudely inchoate: he talks mockingly of a'Jedermannswirklichkeit '. 39 Furthermore, the politician's emphasis on practice, rather than theory, does not mean that his position is free of philosophical\n\n34 HEIDEGGER, Schwarze Hefte 1931-1938, GA94, p. 29; 217.\n\n35 HEIDEGGER, Schwarze Hefte 1931-1938, GA94, p. 429.\n\n36 HEIDEGGER, Schwarze Hefte 1931-1938, GA94, p. 398.\n\n37 HEIDEGGER, Schwarze Hefte 1931-1938, GA94, p. 277; compare pp. 43-4.\n\n38 HEIDEGGER, Schwarze Hefte 1931-1938, GA94, p. 44; 64; 302.\n\n39 HEIDEGGER, Schwarze Hefte 1931-1938, GA94, p. 450.\n\nassumptions; it simply means that these assumptions are allowed to go unarticulated and unquestioned. In this sense, such practice is'indeed the purest and worst'theory''. 40\n\nHeidegger's third, and most infamous, strategy for dealing with the threat posed by the political is to try to co-opt it, to relocate it within his own metaphysical framework. Within GA94, the text that is the focus of this article, this is manifest in several ways. There are, particularly in the period immediately before the Rectoral appointment, excited remarks in which he reimagines his own place in the political order: with the advent of the F√ºhrer, 'the literary existence is at an end'. 41 He also tries to redescribe the political in a way more in tune with his own system. At the aesthetic level, he seeks to align National Socialism with the reticent silence stylised in Sein und Zeit. 42 Likewise, he attempts to embed concepts like Volk within his preferred apparatus: just as authentic Dasein required individualization [ Vereinzelung ] so now does the Volk. 43 Similarly, new terms, such as the'mass' [ Masse ] are introduced to bear the negative features which Heidegger associates with the public, thus allowing Volk to acquire a positive valence, representing at least the possibility for a profound and yet still public relationship to Being. 44 By extension, the true measure of a people is, in line with his privileging of ontology, the establishment and cultivation of the right relationship to Being. 45\n\n## (3) The Occlusion of the Political in GA94\n\nWe now have two elements in play. One is Heidegger's presentation of the political as a threat to philosophy and to ontology - this was covered in section (1). The other is an overview of the strategies he uses to negotiate the interaction between the political and philosophy - this was covered in section (2). I now want to press the issue of the relation between philosophy and politics further. I am going to argue that, in important sense, Heidegger presides over an occlusion or suppression of the political, a development which has deeply problematic consequences.\n\n40 HEIDEGGER, Schwarze Hefte 1931-1938, GA94, p. 117; similarly p.134.\n\n41 HEIDEGGER, Schwarze Hefte 1931-1938, GA94, p. 111; similarly p. 116; 124.\n\n42 HEIDEGGER, Schwarze Hefte 1931-1938, GA94, p. 114.\n\n43 HEIDEGGER, Schwarze Hefte 1931-1938, GA94, p. 98. On Sein und Zeit see HEIEGGER, Sein und Zeit,\n\nT√ºbingen, 1957, p. 266.\n\n44 HEIDEGGER, Schwarze Hefte 1931-1938, GA94, p. 114. Compare HEIDEGGER Beitr√§ge zur Philosophie (Vom Ereignis), GA65, p. 279.\n\n45 HEIDEGGER, Schwarze Hefte 1931-1938, GA94, p. 136.\n\nIn the Parmenides lectures of 1942, published as GA54, Heidegger makes the following remark.\n\nBecause the Greeks are the utterly apolitical people [ das schlechthin unpolitische Volk ], apolitical by essence, because their humanity is primordially and exclusively determined from Being itself, i.e. from ·ºÄŒªŒÆŒ∏ŒµŒπŒ±, therefore only the Greeks could, and precisely had to, found the œÄœåŒªŒπœÇ, found abodes for the gathering and conservation of ·ºÄŒªŒÆŒ∏ŒµŒπŒ±. (GA54:142)\n\nTwo things are immediately striking here. First, the Greeks are presented as'utterly apolitical'. What allows Heidegger to make this extraordinary claim is his belief that the œÄœåŒªŒπœÇ is best understood in ontological terms. As he puts it a few pages earlier:\n\nThe œÄœåŒªŒπœÇ is neither city nor state and definitely not the fatal mixture of those two inappropriate characterisations‚Ä¶The œÄœåŒªŒπœÇ is the abode, gathered in to itself, of the unconcealedness of beings. (GA54:133)\n\nThe Greeks are thus apolitical because what might seem to be a contribution, perhaps the contribution, to political theory is really an ontological structure: the site of unconcealedness. Second, it is because the Greeks are utterly apolitical that they are able to exhibit what is, if not an ideal relationship to Being, certainly a better one than Heidegger thinks modern society possesses. We thus see here first a suppression of the political and second the valorisation of this suppression. Within GA94, Heidegger is happy to project these lessons directly onto the contemporary political landscape. Thus National Socialism must submit to philosophy and to the higher task of sustaining a new stance on Being. 46 By extension, the Party's attempt to promote a'politicized science' is to'put the cart before the horse': it is science, construed in its most primal form as philosophy, which must determine politics. 47\n\nTaken by themselves, these remarks call to mind views familiar since Plato, on which philosophers are somehow uniquely equipped to guide the state. But the reality of Heidegger's position is more complex. The view manifest in both GA54 and GA94 is not one on which philosophy should direct politics, but more one on which philosophy eclipses it or occludes it. Indeed, it is a view on which the political collapses into the ontological. Let me explain.\n\nGA94 is a work written by Heidegger at the height of his public political involvement. It is also, as shown in (1), a work fretfully concerned with the dangers of contemporary\n\n46 HEIDEGGER, Schwarze Hefte 1931-1938, GA94, p. 190.\n\n47 HEIDEGGER, Schwarze Hefte 1931-1938, GA94, p. 191.\n\npolitics. Yet what is perhaps most striking about it is the utter lack of any sustained reflection on the political. Whilst, as in other texts such as the transcripts of his 1933-4 Hegel seminars, Heidegger clearly sympathises with a rudimentary authoritarian political philosophy, he is stunningly disinterested in the key questions that in a period as febrile as the 1930s will shape society. 48 What form of government should be in place? Which economic structures? Who should control the security forces? What legal restrictions on individual speech or choice should there be? What guarantees should individuals have against state action? Is political authority in any sense dependent on consent? To what degree should the state intervene in markets? What role, if any, do non-state bodies such as trade unions have? Who controls the press and how? Who sets wages and how? None of these questions or any like them are in any way visible. In this sense, what I want to highlight in GA94 is an absence as much as anything. 49 It is not so much that Heidegger subjugates political choice to philosophical wisdom, as in the familiar Platonic paradigm. Rather, it is that the distinctive questions which the political should raise are not there. Presciently writing long before the availability of texts such as GA94, de Beistegui makes a similar point - here he is discussing the economic example and the Rektoratsrede in particular.\n\nAs for labour, Heidegger had a no less idealized and partial view of what he failed to recognize as a complex and multifaceted phenomenon, a view that was informed by J√ºnger's Der Arbeiter more than by Marx's Das Kapital. Idealized, first of all, to the extent that Heidegger saw in labor an'obligation' and a'service,' not a reality with a logic and a law of its own (the law of Capital), a reality that is itself productive of ideologies; second, partial insofar as labor is seen as a power of political unification disconnected from its concrete material and economic conditions of existence, and transcending the boundaries of class and the imperatives of production. This raises the question regarding the possibility of taking any political responsibility, or making any political choice, without linking, from the very start, politics with a concrete situation, one which is as economically and materially mediated as it is historically decisive. 50\n\nIt is this failure to recognise the economic and indeed the political more broadly as'a reality with a logic and laws of its own' that I want to highlight. This failure is important because\n\n48 MARTIN HEIDEGGER, √úber Wesen und Begriff von Nature, Geschichte und Staat. √úbung aus dem Wintersemester 1933/34 in: Alfred Denker and Holger Zaborowski (eds.), Heidegger-Jahrbuch 4, Freiburg, 2010, pp.53-88.\n\n49 Page 113 of GA94 contains a few lines on the recognisably political issue of authority and legitimate power, but these remarks are as brief as they are unusual.\n\n50 MIGUEL DE BEISTEGUI, Heidegger and the Political, London, 1998 p. 56.\n\nthat logic will often prove disruptive to the conceptual scheme within which Heidegger instead operates. To take the most pointedly specific of the possible questions which I listed, any sustained reflection on wages, on the labour market, and on its attendant power relations, whether from a capitalist, Marxist or other standpoint, would automatically call into question the use of binary concepts like Volk.\n\nWe need, however to go further: it would not be correct simply to speak of a gap or emptiness, an absence of the political. One important step in challenging Heidegger, I think, is to try to disrupt the metaphorical chains which characterise and bind together his work. So, drawing on both the biological metaphors I introduced above and on Heidegger's own preference for images of opening and closure, we might call the phenomenon in play in GA94 an'occlusion' of the political. This occlusion has two dimensions to it. On the one hand, because, the political is cast primarily as a threat, Heidegger is reluctant to even engage with its categories and questions: how, for example, can he grapple with the intersection of economics and power without entering into the supposedly technological conceptual frameworks that he opposes? Thus, as with the remarks from the Parmenides course, ontological purity requires the suppression of the political, just as the Greeks were able to establish an abode for Being only because they were'utterly apolitical'. On the other hand, within the vacuum created by the lack of any sustained interest in political questions, individual concepts float free from their natural context and are drawn into the gravitational field of Heidegger's ontological apparatus. So, for example, what defines a Volk is a certain relation to Being. 51 The most important aspect of this process is normative. For Heidegger, humanity's fundamental goal is an ontological one in the broad sense of ontology I used above: the task is to preserve the truth of Being. 52 So if we now turn back to the triangle with which I began, the conclusion is clear. Prima facie, the political figures in GA94 both as a threat to the practice of a philosophical relationship with Being and as an opportunity which might be appropriated by that practice. But as the point is pressed, what becomes more striking is the fact that there are few concepts, no questions and no legitimate norms which derive directly from the political sphere in GA94. Instead, it is philosophy and ontology which frame the discourse, the conceptual palette and the acceptable goals. In that sense, I would suggest we need to speak of the collapse of point (II) into point (I), of a dominance of ontology over politics. To introduce, quite deliberately another metaphorical chain and one\n\n51 HEIDEGGER, Schwarze Hefte 1931-1938, GA94, p. 318.\n\n52 HEIDEGGER, Schwarze Hefte 1931-1938, GA94, p. 59; 322.\n\nwhich Heidegger would have abhorred, we might say that the political functions only as distribution channel [ Vertriebskanal ] for the ontological.\n\nI want now to consider three objections to the reading advanced.\n\nFirst, one might object that I have said nothing about how Heidegger's prejudices, for example the anti-Semitism clearly visible in the other notebooks and indeed in Heidegger's personal correspondence more broadly. This is problematic, the objection continues, because those prejudices feed into and partly determine his ontology: consider for example, his rhetoric, surrounding Bodenlosigkeit, simultaneously a technical term in his epistemology and yet plugged into the same ancient rhetorical circuits that depict Jews as rootless parasites. 53 I think there is undoubtedly an important and exegetically highly complex story to be told about the interaction between Heidegger's personal bigotries and his philosophy. Yet my position is entirely neutral on how that story plays out. This is because my concern is not with prejudice, but with politics; and the former is not sufficient for the later. 54 An exact formulation of the point would require a discussion of prejudice beyond the scope of this piece, but the basic idea is best seen if we operate with the standard'negative' picture of prejudice. 55 Consider a misogynist who has a violent prejudice, framed in sexual terms, against women. As a result, the world is manifest to him in the familiar categories of this type of bigotry: he sees those around him as'whores' etc. This prejudice may be kept simmering beneath the surface or it may become openly manifest in the public sphere; and depending partly on how widespread the prejudice is, it may require political action to alleviate it. But none of that is enough to make the prejudice itself political in the sense which is relevant here. Rather, the internal logic, language and drive of the prejudice, how it hangs together, what scenes spark it, what symbols, words, images and categories it uses to interpret the world - these are all sexual: indeed, part of the problem is that salient political categories such as'citizen' are continually overwritten in favour of a taxonomy derived from the language of sexual slurs. 56 The case of Heidegger is similar in that what we see is the absence of those concepts, terms, and norms which are necessary if one is to see things in political\n\n53 For an excellent discussion of these issues and of autochthony in Heidegger's work more broadly see CHARLES BAMBACH¬∏ Heidegger's Roots, Ithaca, New York 2003.\n\n54 Depending on how one thinks about prejudice, for example whether within a broadly Gadamerian framework, it may or may not be necessary.\n\n55 Within a Gadamerian framework emphasising the inescapability and potentially positive role of prejudice, the point would need to be framed slightly differently: there the omnipresence of prejudice in all cognitive domains would mean that it cannot be sufficient to render something political.\n\n56 Another way to put the point. The prejudice may be manifest in the public sphere; but the public sphere, whilst necessary for the political as argued above, is not equivalent to it.\n\nterms. The result, within texts like GA94, is that the political is construed using the concepts and values of ontology. The result, within the later'black notebooks', will be that Heidegger's own prejudices become framed in the same terms: the Jews, not as racial threats, but ontological ones. In this sense I largely agree with Trawny's view that we are dealing with a'seinsgeschichtlicher Antisemitismus '. 57 What I have tried to show is the structural roots of that - how one ends up with that form of prejudice as opposed, say to, the sexuoracial anti-Semitism of someone like Julius Streicher.\n\nSecond, one might object that Heidegger was simply not a political philosopher, and thus that it is unfair or tendentious to make such play out of his lack of interest in detailed political questions. This is a useful objection because it highlights the complex interplay of explanatory levels and evasions within Heidegger's text. As I see it, the claim that he was not a political philosopher is in one sense wrong and in another right. It is wrong because the question of the political, of how to understand it, how to protect philosophy from it, how to control it, is the dominant question of texts such as GA94. If one reflects on the analysis of section (1), it becomes untenable to claim that GA94 is simply disengaged from political issues, in the way that a treatise on pure mathematics might be. Yet, on the other hand, the explanatory apparatus which which Heidegger approaches the political is essentially drawn from ontology. To put it paradoxically, GA94 is an non-political book about politics, one which relentlessly raises political issues only to then thematise them using values and concepts drawn from ontology. Thus, Heidegger is a political thinker insofar as he is discussing politics; yet the hermeneutic situation out of which he does so is articulated in a radically non-political vocabulary. It is this delicate balance that I want to mark by talking of the'occlusion' of the political.\n\nThird, one might raise the concern that I end as an apologist for Heidegger; by stressing the ontological base of his theory, am I guilty of downplaying his culpability for its political consequences? I think the answer here should is simply'no'. Heidegger is culpable for the standard hermeneutic and moral reasons: he is engaging in discourse about a topic, politics, where he has failed utterly to think through his assumptions. Furthermore, it seems to me no accident that, deprived of any systematic reflection on the political per se, his thought lacked any corrective to either his own prejudices or to the crude and inflexible\n\n57 PETER TRAWNY, Heidegger und der Mythos der j√ºdischen Weltverschw√∂rung. Frankfurt am Main, 2014, p.\n\n11.\n\nvision of society that resulted from a myopically ontological focus. I spoke above about the serious consequences of the occlusion I have sketched; this is the most weighty of them.\n\nI want to bring the results together. I have claimed that there is significant sense in which Heidegger collapses point (II) of the triangle, the political, into point (I), the ontological. This is a highly distinctive move. Consider again the example of Kant whom I used when introducing the diagram at the start of this article: it would be untenable to make the same move within a Kantian framework, since that would be precisely to breach, or at least to unacceptably blur, the distinction between theoretical and practical philosophy. Alternately, take the other case I mentioned: Foucault. One can imagine a reading of Foucault on which the ontological is reduced to the political, but is hard to see how the converse could be conceivable. Of course, Heidegger, Kant and Foucault are very different thinkers - and it is precisely that which I want to stress, the distinctiveness of the strategy visible in Heidegger's case, a strategy in which the political is systematically suppressed or occluded in favour of the ontological.\n\n## (4) Beyond Politics: Ethics and Ontology\n\nI now want to say something about the broader application of these claims by bringing in the third point of the triangle. As mentioned at the start, I will talk about this in terms of'ethics' in order to avoid the narrower deontological associations of'morality': my concern is very broadly with the issue of the good life.\n\nPerhaps the most direct way to approach the point is via Heidegger's own remarks in the 1946 letter to Beaufret. One of the main aims of that text is to displace the triangular geometry I have used in favour of some deeper structure. Thus he claims that'the thinking that inquires into the truth of Being‚Ä¶is neither ethical nor ontological'. 58 This is the culmination of a long-held conviction that he has identified a set of originary structures prior to such distinctions. Thus GA26, the 1928 course on Leibniz talks of identifying'common root' of both'theoretical' and'practical' intentionality. 59 But to what degree can we take these remarks at face value? The issue is a complicated one, closely tied to developments\n\n58 MARTIN HEIDEGGER, Wegmarken, GA9, Frankfurt am Main, 2004, p. 357.\n\n59\n\nMARTIN HEIDEGGER, Metaphysische Anfangsgr√ºnde der Logik im Ausgang von Leibniz, GA26, Frankfurt am Main, 2007, pop. 236-7. Similarly; HEIEGGER, Sein und Zeit, T√ºbingen, 1957, p. 193; 358.\n\nwithin Heidegger's thought during over the 1930s, and I cannot address it fully here. But a few remarks may be helpful in the context of what has gone above. 60\n\nThere are very good grounds on which to argue that, just as Heidegger reduced politics to ontology, he does the same with ethics. Take, for example, his early work on authenticity: why does Heidegger regard authenticity, as he plainly does, as a valuable state? Crudely put, why ought one to be authentic? Within both Sein und Zeit itself and in its subsequent reworking in the lecture courses of the late 1920s and early 1930s, two answers emerge. The first is a form of perfectionism: only in authenticity does Dasein fully realise or'liberate' its own essence.\n\nThe most extreme demand [ Zumutung ] must be announced to man, not some arbitrary demand, not this or that one, but the demand pure and simple that is made upon man. And what is that? It is that Dasein as such is demanded of man ‚Ä¶ To what therefore does Dasein have to resolutely disclose itself? To first creating for itself once again a genuine knowing concerning that wherein whatever properly makes Dasein itself possible consists ‚Ä¶ to liberate the humanity in man, i.e. the essence of man, to let the Dasein in him become essential. 61\n\nAs Sein und Zeit puts it, one thereby'becomes 'essentially' Dasein in that authentic existence' so fulfilling the ancient injunction to'become what you are'. 62 The same idea is clearly present in the opening pages of GA94 itself with its injunction that'Der Mensch soll zu sich selbst kommen '. 63 Furthermore Heidegger returns to it throughout, in particular to the possibility of a'future man' who in fully realising his ontologico-historical essence will be unrecognisable when compared to current caricatures of man as subject. 64\n\nBut this, of course, simply postpones the issue - why is such a self-realisation important? After all, there is panoply of other goods: why should I pay particular heed to the demands of authenticity as opposed to power or desire? The worry here is one that Heidegger would have been well aware; it is precisely this concern that motivates thinkers like Kant to\n\n60 I discuss these issues in more depth elsewhere: see SACHA GOLOB, Martin Heidegger: Ethics, Freedom, Ontology in Sacha Golob and Jens Timmermann (eds.), The Cambridge History of Moral Philosophy, Cambridge, 2017.\n\n61 MARTIN HEIDEGGER Die Grundbegriffe der Metaphysik, GA29/30, Frankfurt am Main, 2004, pp. 246-8 (original emphasis); similarly pp. 254-5.\n\n62 HEIDEGGER, Sein und Zeit, p. 323; 145. As I read it, the single inverted commas around'wesentlich'in the first remark cited reflect Heidegger's long-standing suspicions about that term and the ideas traditionally connected to it; I do not think that they indicate any hedging on the basically perfectionist approach to which Heidegger subscribes.\n\n63 HEIDEGGER, Schwarze Hefte 1931-1938, GA94, p. 2; 45.\n\n64 HEIDEGGER, Schwarze Hefte 1931-1938, GA94, p. 334; 481; 491.\n\nreject perfectionism as heterogeneous. 65 This brings me to the second answer which Heidegger offers, namely that authenticity is uniquely valuable because personal authenticity is a necessary condition on doing good philosophy. 66 This is because authenticity alone'guarantees that we are coining the appropriate existential concepts', that we have not been misled by the prejudices and misconstruals fostered by'the one'. 67 As Heidegger himself puts it in 1928:\n\nOnly he can philosophise who is already resolved to grant free dignity to Dasein in its most radical and universal-essential possibilities. 68\n\nOr in 1929:\n\nWhat philosophy deals with only manifests itself at all within and from out of a transformation of human Dasein. 69\n\nBut one might worry that the question is still being begged. If authenticity is valuable as a necessary condition on doing philosophy, that simply postpones the difficulty - why should I care about doing philosophy, as opposed to seeking any of the other goods available?\n\nHeidegger's answer is as clear as is it is revealing: philosophy is an activity in which we are all inescapably involved. As GA27 puts it:\n\nTo be a human means already to philosophise. Already and according to its essence, not opportunely or inopportunely, the human Dasein as such stands in philosophy. 70 In short, 'to exist means to philosophise' (GA27: 214). Of course, Heidegger's conception of what exactly philosophy is is subject to frequent and complex changes. But the one dominating strand is the need to maintain an appropriate relationship to Being, be it Sein or Seyn - this underlying assumption endures, as tracked in section (1), even as the definition of precisely what is'appropriate' changes radically from texts such Sein und Zeit through to the Beitr√§ge and beyond. Bringing these points together, I want to make the following suggestion: Heidegger's treatment of authenticity exemplifies a process whereby what are loosely ethical norms, norms on the good life, become gradually reinterpreted as ontological norms, norms which are a function of our relationship to Being and of our ability to sustain a philosophy that cultivates that relationship. This is because insofar as Sein und Zeit offers a picture of the good life, it is surely through authenticity. Yet as we have pressed on the value\n\n65 IMMANUEL KANT, Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten.

GA27, p. 3.\n\nof that goal, it has become clear that the whole chain of justifications which lies behind authenticity gradually and systematically elides it with ontology - to be authentic is both to liberate our own essence and to enable a philosophy properly orientated towards Being. In short, the triangle with which I began is becoming eclipsed, as, beneath the surface of the text, points (II) and (III) collapse into point (I).\n\nAt this juncture, there are several ways to continue the line of thought. First, my suspicion is that one could easily add other points to the diagram with which I began and watch as they too are simultaneously suppressed and co-opted in favour of the ontological. Consider, for example, the status of the empirical sciences. At times the privileging of philosophico-ontology over them is straightforward: 'the sciences first get their ground, dignity, and entitlements from philosophy'. 71 At others it is more subtle: for example, GA41 effectively argues that Galilean physics has failed to map entities properly, instead tacitly imposing an unquestioned and unverified quantificational framework which leads it to'skip over the facts'. 72 What is striking here is the assumption that the best index for the'facts' is not experimental replication or predictive power, but the deliverances of Heideggerian ontology: as GA94 puts it, '[p]hilosophy is the science'. 73 This may sound unproblematic if watered down to platitudes such as the importance of thinking through the conceptual framework used in a science, rather than simply blindly experimenting away. 74 Yet, of course, science as actually practiced frequently does that. What makes Heidegger's claim controversial and interesting is the assumption that he, despite his non-empirical method of inquiry, is better suited to do that, and even to evaluate the accuracy of those conceptual frameworks, than the scientists themselves. It is worth stressing that I do not think this aspect of Heidegger's work is entirely problematic. Consider the familiar charge, stemming from Tugendhat, that Heidegger fails maintain a distinction between correct and incorrect access to entities. 75 On my account this criticism is fundamentally misplaced. This is because I think that Heidegger has an elaborate and subtle account of how to draw this distinction; the\n\n71 MARTIN HEIDEGGER, Vom Wesen der Wahrheit, Frankfurt am Main, 1997, p. 60.

Wachterhauser (ed.) Hermeneutics and Truth. Evanston, Illinois, 1994.\n\nproblem is rather that it is framed entirely using the methods and vocabulary of ontology as he understands it. 76\n\nSecond, one could look at how the taxonomy I have used - ethical, ontological, political - lines up with some of the other taxonomies in play in Heidegger's discussion, such as that between theory and practice. The complexities of Heidegger's account of'theory' in particular lie beyond this piece. Here I want simply to stress that I am not claiming that Heideggerian ontology will necessarily be theoretical - even if you think, with obvious justification, that philosophy for Heidegger is in an important sense lived, my concern remains over the framing of that lived sphere in terms of concepts drawn from ontology, rather than from other sources such as politics.\n\nThese are potential lines for development. But I want to close by briefly making a different, more modest point. The point is this. As noted above, Heidegger returns to these issues, in particular the relation between philosophy, ontology and ethics, in 1946 in the Letter on Humanism. What is striking is that collectively the Schwarze Hefte serve to undermine the closest thing he offers there to a response to the charge that he allows ontology to occlude ethics and politics. In the Letter, Heidegger suggest that thinking rightly has priority over other forms of action since it'it cares for the light', for the clearing within which all other behaviour become possible. 77 The idea here is that thinking on Being - a lived philosophical ontology - has explanatory priority because it concerns those conditions under which entities can show up in the first place, and thus under which activities such as politics can get started. But the problem with this type of transcendental move is that if a given state is really a transcendental condition of this type, it is hard to make sense of the idea that some agents lack it. Thus, Kant was unable to understand the possibility that Spinoza's statements on religion genuinely reflected his beliefs- after all, they seemed to diverge radically from the practical postulates whose transcendental necessity Kant had just defended. 78 Yet one of the recurring themes of Heidegger's notebooks is that certain groups, such as the Jews, do in a very important sense lack the relations to Being which thought supposedly makes possible. 79 The result is that the privileging of ontological relations - being a'Wahrer der Wahrheit des Seyns ' - cannot, by his own logic, be a function of a\n\n76 For details see GOLOB, Heidegger on Concepts, Freedom, and Normativity, pp. 184-88.\n\n77 HEIDEGGER, Wegmarken, GA9, p.361.\n\n78 IMMANUEL KANT, Kritik der Urteilskraft, AK5, Berlin 1913, pp. 452-3. The authority of these postulates within the Critical system is of course different from that of the categories. But the point stands: they should not be as easily disposable as a Spinoza seems to find them.\n\n79 MARTIN HEIDEGGER, √úberlegungen XII-XV (Schwarze Hefte 1939-1941), GA96, Frankfurt am Main, p. 243.\n\ntranscendental argument insofar as there are groups whom he presents as essentially incapable of participating in those relations, and yet who can nevertheless clearly participate in politics. One option here - the one I suspect Kant would apply at least to Hume, if not also to Spinoza - is to claim that at some level his opponents do and must have the relevant beliefs: they are simply deluded about this. But that surely is not Heidegger's position; one cannot be a guardian of Being whilst caring not a jot about it. Another option, with a more obviously Heideggerian pedigree, is to claim that some basic relation to Being is a transcendental condition on all experience, and that even those he despises have this. But if that is the case, then the privileging of the very sophisticated and specific relation to Being which thought alone offers cannot itself have any transcendental necessity. I have argued that GA94 sees an occlusion of the political by the ontological; ironically, it is Heidegger's antiSemitism that makes that occlusion all the more visible, by depriving him of any prospect of a transcendental justification for it. 80\n\n80 I am very grateful to G√ºnter Figal, Tobias Keiling, Denis McManus, Nikola Mirkovic, Dieter Thomae, Morten Thaning and to all the participants at the 2016 Freiburg Conference for their comments and suggestions on earlier versions of this paper.\n\nArgument map:"

HOCHSCHILD\n\nWheaton College\n\n## I. INTRODUCTION\n\nCajetan's treatment of analogy in De Nominum Analogia is well known as the most influential and sophisticated theory of a central issue in Thomistic philosophy. The late twentieth century saw that theory subject to a family of criticisms. If the critics are correct, Cajetan's analogy theory is also significant historically for exposing weaknesses latent in medieval semantic assumptions. According to the critics, the Aristotelian assumptions that words signify by means of discrete'concepts,' and that the meaning of propositions depends on the significations of its component terms, cannot do justice to the complexity, variety, and flexibility of actual human discourse; in De Nominum Analogia they see the elegant structure of classical semantics collapsing under the pressure of analogical language. In this article, I examine these criticisms of Cajetan's analogy theory, and argue that, in light of both Cajetan's semantic principles and his hermeneutic practice, they fall short. The conclusion not only implies a defense of Cajetan's project, but clarifies the general philosophical alternatives available within the traditional Aristotelian semantic framework.\n\n## II. CRITICISM OF A SEMANTIC ANALYSIS OF ANALOGY\n\n## Ashworth and Ross: The Limits of Classical Semantics\n\nAlthough especially relevant in its applications in metaphysics and theology, analogy was considered by medieval philosophers to be a common feature of language and thought, and so was addressed in connection with general discussions of logic. Considered to be a mean between univocation and equivocation, it tended to be discussed in connection with Aristotle's treatment\n\nof the properties of terms at the beginning of the Categories. As a matter of the semantics of terms, then, analogy was analyzed by medieval thinkers in accordance with two roughly Aristotelian semantic assumptions: (1) that the meaning of a proposition depends on the meaning of its component terms, and (2) that the meaning of a term is a nature signified (and understood) by means of a'concept' or simple act of intellectual apprehension. On these assumptions, a term is univocal in different sentential contexts if, in the different contexts, the same term signifies the same nature by means of the same intellectual act of conception; and a term is equivocal in different sentential contexts if, in the different contexts, the same term signifies different natures by means of different acts of conception. Analogy, as a mean between univocation and equivocation, must involve the same term in different contexts signifying a nature (or natures) partly one and partly many, by means of concepts (or a concept) in some sense the same and in some sense different.\n\nThis of course raises interesting questions. How can there be a mean between one nature and many? How can the act (or acts) of conception, by virtue of which that nature (or those natures) are signified and understood, be somehow the same and somehow different? Although context is valuable for determining whether a particular term exhibits univocity, equivocity, and/or analogy on individual occasions of utterance, answering these questions and developing a general theory of the nature of analogical signification seems to be primarily a matter of analyzing the semantics of terms. Indeed, the general theoretical semantic questions raised about analogy as a mean between univocity and equivocity can be addressed completely independently of, and indeed would be unaffected by, attention to the actual context of particular utterances of analogous terms.\n\nThis accounts for the phenomenon, noted by E. J. Ashworth, that'medieval logicians... discussed analogy and equivocation as if they were properties of single terms, as if neither sentential context nor speaker use and intention were at issue.' 1 Of course, the semantic phenomenon of analogy only manifests itself in the context of different propositions, and it does not seem as if an analysis of isolated terms can entirely explain the fact that humanlanguage exhibits the flexibility that it does. According to Ashworth,\n\n1. E. J. Ashworth, 'Equivocation and Analogy in Fourteenth Century Logic: Ockham, Burley, and Buridan,' in Historia Philosophiae Medii Aevi: Studien zur Geschichte der Philosophie des Mittelalters, ed. Burkhard Mojsisch and Olaf Pluta, 2 vols. (Amsterdam: B. R. Gruner, 1991), 1:28. Ashworth makes similar observations in Ashworth, 'Signification and Modes of Signifying in Thirteenth-Century Logic: A Preface to Aquinas on Analogy,' Medieval Philosophy and Theology 1 (1991): 4546; Ashworth, 'Analogy and Equivocation in Thirteenth-Century Logic: Aquinas in Context,' Mediaeval Studies 54 (1992): 107; and Ashworth, 'Language, Renaissance Philosophy of,' in The Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, in which she writes that in the period she considers'there was littled discussion in logic texts of how words relate to each other in propositional contexts.'\n\nhowever, this indicates a weakness of medieval semantic assumptions, insofar as they made it difficult to analyze analogy in any other way. Paying more attention to'contextual clues,' Ashworth writes, 'would have required a completely different approach to language than was found in thirteenth and fourteenth century logic texts.' 2\n\nIn another article, Ashworth writes that medieval logicians inherited and passed on'a theory of language that tends to take words as units, endowed both with their signification and their modi significandi before they enter sentences and independently of speaker intention on any given occasion.' She continues:\n\nOne might think that equivocal and analogical terms are precisely those whose functioning is best explained through context and use, but... there was a tendency to speak as if equivocal and analogical terms formed special classes that could be identified in advance of use. To the extent that Aquinas's doctrine of analogy is embedded in such a general theory, one may fear that it will share the theory's defects. 3\n\nElsewhere, Ashworth makes similar observations that potentially'cast doubt on the viability of the whole enterprise' of medieval discussions of analogy:\n\nThe theory of analogy as presented by medieval philosophers is... gravely affected by the belief that each word is endowed with its signification, including its grammatical features or consignification, as a unity. Such an assumption is not easy to reconcile with the thought that language is flexible, and that one and the same word can have different shades of meaning. 4\n\nLater, Ashworth is willing to put the matter in even stronger terms. Writing about some fourteenth-century logicians, she summarizes one significant'result' of her findings:\n\n[T]he burden of analogy cannot be carried by single words or single concepts. A term cannot be used to express priority and posteriority and attribution, and yet these notions are expressed in language. The obvious solution is to give up the attempt to categorize terms as equivocal, univocal, or analogical, and to look instead at how they behave in different contexts and in relation to different sentential structures.\n\n2. Ashworth, 'Equivocation and Analogy in Fourteenth Century Logic,' pp. 4243. 3. Ashworth, 'Signification and Modes of Signifying in Thirteenth-Century Logic,' p. 67. 4. Ashworth, 'Analogical Concepts: The Fourteenth Century Background to Cajetan,' Dialogue 31 (1992): 400.\n\n## 244\n\nUnfortunately, this solution seems to have been incompatible with medieval approaches to language. 5\n\nAshworth voices this criticism-that medieval semantic assumptions limited medieval philosophers from properly handling the phenomenon of analogy-somewhat more tentatively than James F. Ross, whose Portraying Analogy she occasionally cites. 6 Ross's book begins with severe criticism of'classical' approaches to analogy, including Cajetan's. Ross note that the key assumptions and metaphors of the classical story about analogy were exhausted, as far as fruitful theoretical elaboration is concerned, by the time Cajetan produced De Nominum Analogia in 1498, the last systematic explanation of analogy of meaning since the middle ages. 7\n\nWhat Ross here calls the'key assumptions... of the classical story' constitute the basic framework of traditional Aristotelian logic. Thus Ross says that'the classical theory [of analogy] suffers from limitations of scope and perspective,' and furthermore that it is'based on false premises.' Among the allegedly false premises are the two we already mentioned, which we could name, respectively, the conceptualist and the compositionalist assumptions: 'that word meanings are ideas- (concepts-, thoughts-) in-the-mind-signifiedby-conventional-sounds,' and'that sentence meaning is the molecular sum (syncategorematically computed) of the atomic meanings of the component words.' 8\n\nRoss does little in Portraying Analogy to explain the suspect'classical' premises, to show that they are indeed'classical,' or to formulate any particular criticisms of them. 9 But, his charges are shared implicitly and explicitly by others, and, on the face of it, the two premises criticized by Ross do seem to be assumptions Cajetan makes in De Nominum Analogia. Cajetan's explicit project is to explain the character of the unity of the concepts signified by analogous terms, hoping to explain both the nature of true predication and the possibility of valid inferences that contain such terms. If the Aristotelian compositionalist and conceptualist semantic assumptions underlying this project are false, that is ipso facto an indictment of Cajetan's theory of analogy.\n\n5. E. J. Ashworth, 'Analogy, Univocation, and Equivocation in Some Early Fourteenth Century Authors,' in Aristotle in Britain During the Middle Ages, ed. John Marenbon (Brepols Turnhout, 1996), pp. 246-47. 6. James F. Ross, Portraying Analogy (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1981). 7. Ross, Portraying Analogy, p. ix. 8. Ross, Portraying Analogy, p. ix. 9. Similar critical observations are also made in a review of Ross's book by Josef Stern, The Journal of Philosophy 84 (1987): 392-97.\n\n## Gilson's'Concept versus Judgment' Criticism\n\nThis is also an indictment of anyone else who would theorize about analogy within the framework of Aristotelian semantic assumptions. As such, this criticism could implicate Aquinas as easily as Cajetan, as is already acknowledged in one of the above quotations from Ashworth. This is why some partisans of Aquinas have taken comfort in the fact that Aquinas never ventured an explicit semantic analysis of analogical signification on the order of Cajetan's. That Aquinas's writings on analogy are restricted to limited remarks on the occasions of particular philosophical or theological difficulties, with no systematic formal analysis, is taken by some to be evidence of Aquinas's greater sensitivity to the analogy phenomenon. Even if, as Ashworth suggests, Thomas might have shared the basic semantic assumptions of the medieval logical tradition, he never attempted their exhaustive application to explain analogical signification.\n\nThis suggests a connection between the explicit criticism of a semantic analysis of analogy and another criticism of Cajetan-that his theory of analogy is unduly preoccupied with'concepts' as opposed to'judgment.' Thomistic scholar Armand Maurer represents the views of many when he notes that\n\nIt is not generally realized that St. Thomas' doctrine of analogy is above all a doctrine of the judgment of analogy, and not of the analogy of concept -at least if we mean by'concept' the expression of an act of simple apprehension. 10\n\nElsewhere Maurer elaborates on this point, making it a specific criticism of Cajetan and relating it to a charge of inappropriate Scotistic influence on Cajetan's doctrine:\n\nCajetan's treatise On the Analogy of Names is an attempt to put into order the Thomistic notion of analogy. Whereas in St. Thomas' writings analogy is used with great suppleness and flexibility as a means of approaching God, who is unknown in His essence, Cajetan proposes a rigid classification of the types of analogy that excludes all but the analogy of proper (or non-metaphorical) proportionality as the true metaphysical analogy. Throughout his treatment of analogy he tends to leave out of consideration the central notion of esse and to conceive of analogy in terms of concepts rather than judgment. In both regards he resembles the Scotists against whom he argued. 11\n\n10. Armand Maurer, 'St. Thomas and the Analogy of Genus,' The New Scholasticism 29 (1955): 143. Maurer's claims are considered in Michael P. Slattery, 'Concerning Two Recent Studies in Analogy,' The New Scholasticism 31 (1957): 237-46. 11. Armand Maurer, Medieval Philosophy, 2d ed. (Toronto: Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies, 1982), p. 351.\n\n## 246\n\nMaurer is not alone in his evaluation of Cajetan's strategy. Patrick Sherry has criticized Cajetan's decision'to devote a disproportionate amount of time explaining how there can be a single analogical concept.' Anticipating Ross's strategy, he concludes:\n\nWe can avoid such contortions, I think, if we make a radical break with the tendency to view concepts as psychological entities and instead approach the matter by examining the truth conditions of judgments [that involve analogy]. 12\n\nThe recurrent contrast of the role of concepts with the role of judgment in analogy can be traced back to ¬¥ Etienne Gilson. According to Gilson:\n\nThe Thomist doctrine of analogy is above all a doctrine of the judgment of analogy. It is in fact thanks to judgment of proportion that, without a change of nature, one can make of the concept a usage sometimes equivocal, sometimes analogical, sometimes univocal... The analogy of which Duns Scotus thinks is much more an analogy of concept. For, on the level of the concept and of representation, analogy is practically confused with likeness. It is no longer a matter of knowing whether two terms play an analogous role in a judgment of proportion, but whether the concept designated by one term is or is not the same as the concept designated by the other. 13\n\n12. Patrick J. Sherry, 'Analogy Today,' Philosophy 51 (1976): 443. 13. ¬¥ Etienne Gilson, Jean Duns Scot: Introduction ` a ses Positions Fondamentales (Paris: Librairie Philosophique J. Vrin, 1952), 101-2:\n\nLa doctrine thomiste de l'analogie est avant tout une doctrine du jugement d'analogie. C'est en effet grÀÜ ace au jugement de proportion que, sans en alt¬¥ erer la nature, on peut faire du concept un usage tantÀÜ ot ¬¥ equivoque, tantÀÜ ot analogique, tantÀÜ ot univoque.... L'analogie ` a laquelle pense Duns Scot est beaucoup plutÀÜ ot une analogie du concept. Or, sur le plan du concept et de la repr¬¥ esentation, l'analogie se confond pratiquement avec la ressemblance. Il ne s'agit plus alors de savoir si deux terms jouent un rÀÜ ole analogue dans un jugement de proportion, mais si le concept d¬¥ esign¬¥ e par un terme est ou n'est pas le mÀÜ eme que le concept d¬¥ esign¬¥ e par l'autre.\n\nGilson advances this interpretation of Thomistic analogy in terms of judgment vs. concepts elsewhere as well: Gilson, The Christian Philosophy of St. Thomas Aquinas, trans. L. K. Shook (New York: Random House, 1956), pp. 106-9. Gilson, Le Thomisme, Introduction a la philosophie de Saint Thomas d'Aquin, 5th ed. (Paris: Vrin, 1944): 'Sur le plan du concept, il n'y a pas de milieu entre l'univoque et l'equivoque' (p. 155; the word'concept' is translated as'quiddity' in Shook's English translation). See also Gilson, Being and Some Philosophers, 2d ed. (Toronto: Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies, 1952), pp. 190-215.\n\nGilson's interpretation of Thomistic analogy, with its implicit criticism of Cajetan's concern to characterize the analogical concept, has had wide influence. 14 David Burrell has perhaps given it the most extensive elaboration. According to Burrell:\n\nWhoever understands that analogy is to be explicated'on the level of judgment' and not of concepts, Gilson contends, has also grasped the real divergence between Aquinas and Scotus.... Judgment is indispensable precisely because responsible analogous usage requires that we assess the way in which a term is being used in relation to its primary analogate. 15\n\nIn Burrell's presentation, the connection between the charge that a concern with concepts is more Scotistic than Thomistic, and the charge that analogy is not fruitfully subjected to traditional semantic analysis, is especially clear. In his first book about analogy-with which his later writings about analogy have remained essentially consistent-Burrell explains that he wants to get away from'attempts... to collate the ways we use analogical expression into one theoretical mold.' 16 In a section on the'limits of formal analysis,' Burrell considers some recent attempts to'salvage' Cajetan's'formal analysis': 17\n\n[F]ormal attempts to explain analogous usage seem self-defeating. They shunt from the formally correct but too narrowly stipulative to a more\n\n14. In addition to those mentioned, Gilson's interpretation on this point is also followed by: George P. Klubertanz, St. Thomas Aquinas on Analogy: A Textual Analysis and Systematic Synthesis (Chicago: Loyola University Press, 1960), p. 116 ('analogy is primarily an affair of judgment rather than concept'); Henri de Lubac, The Discovery of God, trans. Alexander Dru (New York: P. J. Kenedy and Sons, 1960), p. 201. See also E. L. Mascall, Existence and Analogy (London: Longmans, 1949), pp. 116-21 and Gregory Philip Rocca, Speaking the Incomprehensible God: Thomas Aquinas and the Interplay of Positive and Negative Theology (Washington: Catholic University of America Press, 2004), esp. ch. 7. Battista Mondin has dissented from Gilson's interpretation, arguing for the the compatibility of judgment and concept. Mondin, The Principle of Analogy in Protestant and Catholic Theology, 2d ed. (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1968), pp. 58 n.2; 60 n.2. Rocca also admits the compatibility of emphasizing judgment and concept (pp. 165-73, 193, 195).\n\n15. Burrell, 'From Analogy of'Being' to the Analogy of Being,' in Recovering Nature: Essays in Natural Philosophy, Ethics and Metaphysics in Honor of Ralph P. McInerny, ed. Thomas Hibbs and John O'Callaghan (Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 1999), pp. 259-60. See also Burrell, Analogy and Philosophical Language (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1973), p. 204.\n\n16. Burrell, Analogy and Philosophical Language, p. 5.\n\n17. Burrell has in mind specifically Bochenski, 'On Analogy,' The Thomist (1948): 425-77, and James F. Ross, 'Analogy as a Rule of Meaning for Religious Language,' International Philosophical Quarterly 1 (1961): 468-502; the latter was written before Ross's own rejection of such approaches in Portraying Analogy.\n\nadequate but formally less acceptable scheme. The very recurrence of this pattern is revealing. Analogy, it seems, is closely linked to a purposive use of language. One of the serviceable features of analogous terms is their adaptability to diverse contexts. Yet the language we use to express our judgment about entire frameworks, and their adequacy to the more comprehensivepurposesof inquiry, is also markedly analogical. Hence a formal characterization seems impossible in principle since formal logic constructs languages and tests their consistency but does not appraise them with respect to extralogical purposes. 18\n\nIn the words of one commentator, Burrell wants, 'in lieu of a theory about analogy, [to] establish his own thesis that paying close grammatical attention to the way analogous terms are actually used will demonstrate the freedom, fluidity, responsibility, and judgment actually involved in such usage.' 19\n\nBurrell notes that he thinks Ross's Portraying Analogy actually cooperates with the work of Gilson and Lonergan and other scholars by whose efforts'Aquinas is justly liberated from a Thomistic rendition of'abstraction' often more beholden to Scotus.' 20 Burrell elaborates: 'Lonergan's account of concept-formation in Verbum: Word and Idea in Aquinas, for example, independently corroborated by Peter Geach, could offer the necessary bridge linking Aquinas' efforts with Ross' semantic sophistication.' 21 In a footnote, Burrell clarifies that he is speaking of'Peter Geach's observations in Mental Acts... regarding abstraction, together with Lonergan's comprehensive review of the matter in Verbum, explicitly designed to correct the vaguely Scotistic accounts which had paraded as standard Thomistic epistemology.' 22\n\nBurrell can thus separate Aquinas from the'Thomist' tradition, which has been engaged in the problematic pursuit of a semantic analysis of analogy. It is Thomists such as Cajetan, but not Thomas Aquinas himself, who attempted to analyze analogical signification in terms of relations of concepts. In so doing, the'Thomist' tradition has inadvertently succumbed to Scotistic influence, 23 necessarily resulting in philosophical confusion. 24\n\n18.

Bernard Lonergan does seem to be under the specific impression that Cajetan's view of concepts has been unduly influenced by Scotus; see Bernard Lonergan, Verbum: Word and Idea in Aquinas, ed. David Burrell (Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 1967), p. 25 n.122. However, see Lonergan, Insight: A Study of Human Understanding, 3d ed. (New York: Philosophical Library, 1970), pp. 368-71. 24. See Michael McCanles, who has argued that'once... analogy is dealt with on the level of concepts, the pressure seems of necessity to push esse toward a univocal concept, as both Scotus and Ockham show. Cajetan's analogical concept\n\nBurrell finds confirmation for this criticism of Cajetan in the treatment of analogy by Yves Simon. In his article, 'On Order in Analogical Sets,' Simon speaks of analogical terms as terms which signify'analogical sets,' sets in which there is some kind of'order.' 25 Simon then considers in what sense a common meaning can be'abstracted' from the analogical set. Because there is an'irreducible plurality' in analogy, analogical unity resists abstraction in the proper sense. This is not always properly recognized, says Simon. Analogates are'partly different,' but they are also'partly similar,' and so given this similarity, it is tempting to assume that'in spite of it all, the meanings do have a common feature, albeit a very thin one, which survives the differences and makes it possible for a term, whose unity is but one of analogy, to play the role of a syllogistic term.' 26 But for Simon it is naive to assume that'some common feature will be disclosed' and abstracted from diverse analogates. 27\n\nDiverse analogates do have analogical unity; but, Simon says, this'unity is traced to an operation of the mind,' an operation that is only a kind of partial abstraction. 28 He continues by noting that, 'Besides unqualified abstraction, which pertains to the univocal alone, there is such a thing as an analogical abstraction, although, in this expression, the adjective weakens the signification of the noun.' 29 Simon calls this'an abstraction by way of confusion..., an incomplete, weak, partial abstraction.' 30 Reiterating this sense of abstraction'by way of confusion,' Simon says, 'Analogical abstraction proceeds by'fusing together' the members of a set. But such'fusing together' involves assertions and negations that define priorities and posteriorities.' 31\n\ncannot maintain its integrity' (McCanles, 'Univocalism in Cajetan's Doctrine of Analogy,' New Scholasticism 42 [1968]: 47). McCanles thus describes what he sees as the problem of a semantic analysis of analogy that makes reference to the analogical concept: '[Cajetan's] method of treating the problem is at odds with itself, and to a very large extent undercuts the very doctrine he is overtly trying to refine' (p. 19). Unfortunatley, McCanles's argument is complicated by a confusion; McCanles does not sufficiently distinguish the issue of analogical signification in general (which is Cajetan's main concern in De Nominum Analogia ) from the metaphysical issue of describing'the analogy of being.'\n\n25. Simon, 'On Order in Analogical Sets,' in Philosopher at Work: Essays by Yves R. Simon, ed. Anthony O. Simon (Lanham, Md. Rowman and Littlefield, 1999), pp. 135-71; originally in New Scholasticism 34 (1960): 1-42.\n\n26. Simon, 'On Order in Analogical Sets,' p. 140. 27. As an example of one tempted by this naive assumption: 'The suggestion here proposed is that, in order to employ analogical predication... we must hold that any two entities standing in an analogical relation to each other... must have a minimum of one property in common' (Paul C. Hayner, 'Analogical Predication,' The Journal of Philosophy 55 [1958]: 860). 28. Simon, 'On Order in Analogical Sets,' p. 145. 29. Simon, 'On Order in Analogical Sets,' p. 143. 30. Simon, 'On Order in Analogical Sets,' p. 145, emphasis Simon's. 31. Simon, 'On Order in Analogical Sets,' p. 156.\n\nAs Burrell puts it, this means that'the 'analogical concept'... is a halfway house,' that'the 'analogous concept' points beyond itself to a series of judgments.' 32 For, according to Burrell, the analogical'abstraction' described by Simon'is in the order of judgment, not of apprehension.' 33 For Burrell, this confirms Gilson's point that a genuinely Thomistic understanding of analogy should emphasize judgment rather than concepts. Cajetan's search for the unity of the analogical concept is thus inherently flawed. Rather than speak of formal analysis of analogical concepts, according to Burrell, we must approach analogy by attention to the different ways that analogical terms are used. 34\n\n## Summary\n\nSome of the above commentators could be criticized for the failing to keep separate the general issue of analogical signification on the one hand, and such specific issues as divine naming and'the metaphysical analogy of being' on the other hand. 35 Yet, despite such areas of confusion, we can distill from these commentators the following rather straightforward criticism of Cajetan: 'Signifying analogically' is not a property that terms have independently of their use in particular sentences. To recognize analogical signification requires judgment. Thus analogical signification cannot be considered apart from the particular linguistic circumstances in which it arises. A proper philosophical treatment of the phenomenon of analogical signification will not consider words independently of their context, independently of actual usage. This, however, is not Cajetan's strategy; his De Nominum Analogia is not about judgment and context, but about relations of concepts. Cajetan's attempt to characterize the analogical'concept' is evidence that he is concerned with abstracting the semantic properties of terms from the context of actual predications and inferences. That this strategy results in a strict classification of kinds of analogy, rather than a flexible and sensitive understanding of the varieties of analogous usage, is further evidence of its inadequacy.\n\n32. Burrell, 'A Note on Analogy,' p. 226. 33. Burrell, 'A Note on Analogy,' p. 225; see also Burrell, Analogy and Philosophical Language, p. 203. 34. Burrell's emphasis on use is the most obvious manifestation of his (acknowledged) debt to Wittgenstein. See Burrell, Analogy and Philosophical Language, pp. 17, 122, 123. 35. Perhaps it could be argued that to insist on such a distinction is already to grant Cajetan too much, to separate analogy from the'context' of particular theological and metaphysical judgments. Nonetheless, the phenomenon of analogical signification does take place outside of theology and metaphysics. It is reasonable to insist on the logical distinction between considering the phenomenon of analogical signification in general, and considering particular terms, such as'being' or divine names, which can exhibit analogical signification.\n\n## III. REPLIES\n\nIn response to this criticism, I want to consider three things: in particular (1) Cajetan's understanding of a'concept'; more generally, (2) the theoretical question of the compatibility of insights about the importance of interpretation, context, and judgment with a semantic analysis of terms; and finally (3) Cajetan's own practice of treating cases of analogical signification and his sensitivity to context and judgment.\n\n## Cajetan's Notion of the'Concept'\n\nCajetan's concern with'concepts' is accused of being Scotistic, rather than Thomistic. On one level, it must be granted that Cajetan's concern with concepts is the result of Scotus's influence. Basing some arguments on the premise that a concept that could preserve the validity of a syllogism must be univocal, Scotus and his followers had argued that analogy was impossible. Thomists, pressed to respond to this premise, often resorted to discussing the notion of a concept and in what sense it had to be'unified' in order to preserve the validity of a syllogism. 36\n\nBut is Cajetan's understanding of'concepts' un-Thomistic, or otherwise at odds with a Thomistic understanding of analogy? Fortunately, Cajetan's writings are quite clear on his understanding of'concept.' In the most basic sense, the conceptus is just that which mediates thinking and signifying. The concept is the act of simple apprehension, the act of intellect by virtue of which something is understood, and by virtue of which a word is said to signify a thing. Cajetan spells this out in his commentary on De Ente et Essentia: 'a thing is understood at the time when we form its concept.... [T]he formation of a concept is the making of the external thing actually known.' 37 Furthermore, in his commentary on the Summa, Cajetan writes: 'words only signify things by the mediation of intellectual conception; therefore signification is caused by conception.' 38 In short, a\n\n36. On this challenge, and the inadequacy of Aquinas's remarks on analogy to address it, see Joshua P. Hochschild, 'Did Aquinas Answer Cajetan's Question? Aquinas's Semantic Rules for Analogy,' in Proceedings of the American Catholic Philosophical Association 77 (2003): 273-88. 37. Cajetan, Commentaria in De Ente et Essentia [ = CDEE ] ¬ß 67: 'res intelligitur quando ejus conceptum formamus.... conceptus formatio est factio rei extra actu intelectae.' 38. Cajetan, Commentaria in Summam Theologiae St Thomae, I.13.1, n.3: 'voces significant res non nisi media conceptione intellectus; igitur significatio causatur ex conceptione.'\n\nword signifies a thing by the mediation of a concept, and a concept is just what causes a thing to be understood. 39\n\nCajetan's point about the'conceptus'here is the general medieval one that to form a concept is to establish an understanding. Given the common notion of signification as the establishment of understanding, 40 it is hardly controversial to assert that signification takes place by the mediation of a concept. 41 And so it should not be controversial that the logical consideration of acts of simple apprehension manifests itself as consideration of'concepts,' and that terms which signify analogically would be analyzed with respect to the concepts by virtue of which they so signify. 42\n\nObviously, such an understanding of'concepts' is not inconsistent with the observation that signifying analogically is a property of terms only in the context of particular propositions, representing particular acts of judgment. Such is the nature of what medieval thinkers, including Aquinas, called the\n\n39. Actually the'concept' discussed in this paragraph-that by which something is signified and understood-is by Cajetan and other Thomists in some contexts called by a more technical name, the formal concept, to distinguish it from the objective concept; see for example, CDEE ¬ß 14. See also Jacques Maritain, Distinguish to Unite, or The Degrees of Knowledge, trans. Gerald B. Phelan (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1959), App. I ('The Concept'), pp. 387-417. 40. Gabriel Nuchelmans offers as the standard definition of'significare'for latescholastic philosophers: 'representing some thing or some things or in some way to the cognitive faculty' (Nuchelmans, Late-Scholastic and Humanist Theories of the Proposition [Amsterdam: North Holland Publishing Company, 1980], p. 14). Paul Vincent Spade makes a similar point when he notes that'signification is a psychologicocausal property of terms' that is traced back to Boethius's claim that ''to signify' something was'to establish an understanding of it'' (Spade, 'The Semantics of Terms,' in The Cambridge History of Later Medieval Philosophy [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1982], p. 188). See also E. J. Ashworth, 'Signification and Modes of Signifying in Thirteenth-Century Logic,' p. 44: 'to signify is to establish an understanding ( significare est intellectum constituere ).' 41. Cajetan is also thus far consistent with Geach, cited above by Burrell as an important corrective to'Thomistic' epistemology: like Cajetan, Geach understood'concepts' to be'mental capacities' the possession of which are'presupposed by acts of judgment,' and the'abstractionism' criticized by Geach is in no way implied in Cajetan's understanding of concepts sketched here. Peter Geach, Mental Acts: Their Content and Their Objects (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1957), p. 14 and passim. 42. Indeed, this medieval notion of the'conceptus'can easily be traced to the Greek tradition, as Sten Ebbesen has done, noting the connection between the classification of different kinds of equivocation (including analogy) on the one hand, and concept formation on the other. The Greek logical tradition's classification of different kinds of equivocals'can be understood as a classification of the reasons for choosing the same word to signify different concepts and things, deriving this classification from one that shows in how many ways concepts are formed' (Ebbesen, Commentators and Commentaries on Aristotle's Sophistici Elenchi: A Study of Post-Aristotelian Ancient and Medieval Writings on Fallacies, vol. 1: The Greek Tradition [Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1981], p. 190). In this endeavor, the role of judgment (' reasons for choosing the same word to signify different concepts and things') is undeniable.\n\nfirst and second acts of intellection, that is, simple apprehension and composing and dividing (or judgment ). 43 Indeed, Gilson, who most fully articulated the supposed contrast between concept and judgment in analogy, both affirms that the'concept' should be understood in the sense Cajetan did, 44 and recognizes that the formation of such concepts is consistent with, indeed part of, forming judgments. 45 In the passage quoted above, Gilson makes it sound as if the question of'whether the concept designated by one term is or is not the same as the concept designated by the other' is raised by Scotus but not by Thomas; however, if one makes a Thomistic'judgment of proportion,' which allows one to'make of the concept a usage... [which is] analogical,' the Scotistic question can arise. For instance, judging that there is a proportion between the relation of the eye to its object and the relation of the intellect to its object, we agree to predicate'sight' of both the eye and the intellect. But is the same concept signified by the predicate when we say'the eye sees' as is signified by the same predicate when we say that'the intellect sees'? To be sure, the question about the identity or non-identity of concepts does not need to be answered before we are able to form the former judgment of proportion; but the question about concepts is compatible withand, in fact, is raised by-the judgment. The question becomes particularly pressing when we are confronted with Scotistic arguments that call into question the logical possibility of making such judgments.\n\n43. Nuchelmans clarifies that there are actually two senses of judgment one can consider: there is a kind of judging that is really an apprehension which forms a mental proposition (the'apprehensive proposition'), and there is a kind of judging that is the act of knowing, believing, or opining that this mental proposition is (or is not) true (Nuchelmans, Late-Scholastic and Humanist Theories of the Proposition, pp. 74-76). However, since the latter judgment requires the former apprehensive proposition, which in turn implies an apprehension of the terms of the apprehensive proposition, Nuchelmans's analysis only confirms that judgment is not opposed to, but rather presupposes, semantic considerations. As he puts it:\n\nin general questions concerning acts of judging, knowing, and believing, and concerning objects of knowledge and belief, were treated by scholastic philosophers for other reasons than sheer curiosity about the semantics of declarative sentences.... But in dealing with the psychological and epistemological issues which were forced upon them by their theological interests or the pursuit of wider inquiries of a similar type, they were unavoidably faced with problems which have a predominantly semantical character (p. 103).\n\nOnthe late-scholastic Thomist understanding of apprehensive propositions and the object of judgment, see pp. 99-102, 111-12.\n\n44. See ¬¥ Etienne Gilson, Linguistics and Philosophy: An Essay on the Philosophical Constants of Language, trans. John Lyon (Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 1988), pp. 75-78, 187 n.25. 45. See ¬¥ Etienne Gilson, The Elements of Christian Philosophy (New York: New American Library, 1963), p. 250.\n\nIn fact, I would suggest that understood in context, Gilson's remarks about the difference between Aquinas's emphasis on judgment and Scotus's emphasis on concepts should never have become the basis for a Thomistic objection to a semantic analysis of analogy. First, it must be remembered that in the relevant passage, Gilson is not concerned with analogy as such, but with'the analogy of being' (' analogie de l'ÀÜ etre ') and Scotus's objections to it; Gilson intends to explain how Aquinas and Scotus differ in understanding the central metaphysical notion, being. Second, in explaining this difference, Gilson several times emphasizes that Aquinas and Scotus are not so much disagreeing as talking past each other. 46 And third, as the source of their different approaches to being, Gilson identifies their different views of what concepts are, how they are formed, and how they signify; he nowhere denies, nor could he, that Aquinas believes that judgments of proportion are made with concepts. Indeed, as Gilson notes, 'It is in fact thanks to judgment of proportion that, without a change of nature, one can make of the concept a usage sometimes equivocal, sometimes analogical, sometimes univocal' (emphasis added). Such an observation simply cannot be the basis for the conclusion that it is against the spirit of Aquinas for a logician to consider the concepts that result from such a judgment of proportion, that is, those concepts by virtue of which analogous terms signify.\n\nThe consistency of attending to both concept and judgment is further borne out by Yves Simon's reflections, which Burrell had taken as implicitly critical of Cajetan. Closely following Cajetan's theory, Simon demonstrates that, even within the framework of Cajetan's semantic analysis and an attention to concepts, one can be sensitive to the role of judgment in analogy. 47\n\nIndeed, the core of Simon's'On Order in Analogical Sets' can be considered an elaboration of Cajetan's discussion of abstraction in the sixth chapter of De Nominum Analogia ( ¬ß¬ß 41-58, Qualis sit abstractio analogi ab\n\n46. Gilson, Jean Duns Scot, 101-2: 'les interlocuteurs ne parlent pas la mÀÜ eme langue.... lorsqu'il rencontre l'analogie thomiste, on ne peut pas dire exactement que Duns Scot le r¬¥ efute, on dirai plutÀÜ ot qu'il ne peut pas y croire.... ¬¥ Evidement, ce serait perdre son temps que de vouloir concilier les deux doctrines et, tout autant, de r¬¥ efuter l'une par l'autre.' 47. Simon's article assumes, and never dissents from, Cajetan's treatment of analogy. Simon makes it clear he is using Cajetan's classification of analogous modes, and Cajetan's terminology for that classification (Simon, 'On Order in Analogical Sets,' p. 137); he agrees with Cajetan that'in [analogy of] attribution... the object signified by the analogical term exists intrinsically in only one' of the analogates (p. 137); like Cajetan, Simon regards analogy of proper proportionality as the most genuine form of analogy (p. 138 ff.), and, as in Cajetan's theory, this is connected to the fact that in analogy of proportionality'the form designated by the analogical term exists intrinsically in each and every one of the analogates' (p. 138; cf. p. 140); Simon defends Cajetan against the criticisms of F. A. Blanche (p. 165-167, n.27); and he cites approvingly other unabashed Cajetanians (John of St. Thomas and James Anderson).\n\nanalogatis ). 48 There, Cajetan clarifies the sense of'abstraction' that applies to analogy of proper proportionality, and his conclusions become the central points of Simon's reflection. 49 While a more extended discussion of what Cajetan says in that chapter cannot be articulated here, we can find in Cajetan precisely those points made by Simon and highlighted by Burell: since analogical unity is irreducible ( DNA ¬ß 49), from diverse analogates there can not be abstraction properly speaking ( ¬ß¬ß 44, 56; cf. ¬ß¬ß 33-34), but there is a qualified sense of abstraction ( ¬ß 56), which actually involves a kind of'confusion' ( ¬ß 57) 50; analogical unity always'retains distinction' ( ¬ß 49), and thus we must be vigilant lest we ignore the distinctions and treat an analogical term as univocal ( ¬ß¬ß 53-54, 57). 51\n\nThis confirms that Cajetan's project is not to try to reduce analogy to something else, but to characterize as specifically as possible the semantics of analogical terms. That Cajetan's semantic characterizations vindicate what Simon calls the irreducibility of proportional unity, and the impossibility of\n\n48. Simon might also be benefitting from John of St. Thomas's own reflections on this part of Cajetan's theory, in Ars Logica, p. 2, q. 13, a. 5, 'Utrum in analogis detur unus conceptus ab inferioribus praecisus' (491a40-500b47). Simon was the chief translator of sections of the Secunda Pars of the Ars Logica, published (five years before Simon's'On Order in Analogical Sets') as The Material Logic of John of St. Thomas: Basic Treatises (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1955). At one point, the translation renders the phrase'Analoga attributionis et analoga metaphorica' (491b21-22, literally: 'analogues of attribution and metaphorical analogues') as'The terms of an analogous set, in analogy of attribution or of metaphor' (p. 168, emphasis added).\n\n49. Contra Burrell ( Analogy and Philosophical Language, p. 203), Simon does take analogy of proper proportionality as the'normal form' or genuine kind of analogy.\n\n50. All of this is why, in the previous chapter of De Nominum Analogia, Cajetan had already acknowledged that one must qualify the sense in which one may speak of an analogical concept ( De Nominum Analogia [ DNA ] ¬ß¬ß 36-37).\n\n51. Oddly, when Burrell considers Cajetan's presentation of the irreducibility of proportional unity and the impossibility of abstraction properly speaking, he finds them fraught with difficulty. Says Burrell: [E]ven though [according to Cajetan] 'it is impossible to abstract from these many something which is absolutely one,' even if we cannot pretend to a common concept, we still can and do use a single term like being (or principle). Cajetan allows us to do so on the strength of similitude, but the'very similitude itself is only proportional, and its foundation is only proportionally one'; in this way'proportional similitude in its very nature includes... diversity' ([ DNA ] nn.48-49). Something is very wrong here, of course. Language is taking a holiday. If one needs to speak of a similitude, it had best be a single one and not a proportional one. For whether we think of similitude as a kind of template or prefer to be guided by a careful use of language, the upshot will have to be something invariant, else why invoke the expression? Careful attention to language would note that'x is similar to y'is an ellipsis which must furnish'in respect z'on demand. Now the precise respect in which substantial and quantitative predicates are similar defies expression. This is indeed the entire thrust of Cajetan's work: they are similar in so far as each is related to its to be ( esse ). (Burrell, Analogy and Philosophical Language, p. 14)\n\na common element being purely abstracted, speaks to both the strength and the limits of semantic analysis; it certainly does not falsify the phenomenon of analogy, nor is it an abuse of semantic analysis. 52 Indeed, these insights only help to distill the further semantic question which concerned Cajetan, one which Simon leaves unanswered (though acknowledged): 53 how does proportional unity suffice to unify syllogistic inferences?\n\n## Context, Judgment, and the History of Medieval Logic\n\nI have argued that, in principle, there is nothing about a semantic analysis of terms as such which is incompatible with a sensitivity to the role that a sentence or inference plays in giving context to terms. As a matter of fact, historians of logic have long noted that it is precisely the context of particular inferences, especially problematic or questionable inferences ( sophismata ), which helped to foster the medieval development of sophisticated treatments of the logical properties of propositions and terms. L. M. de Rijk has shown that the analysis of fallacy was a primary motive in the development of terminist logic. 54 Likewise Alexander Broadie, in his\n\n52. In this regard, we might say that Cajetan's treatment of analogy corroborates Gadamer's judgment:\n\nThe merit of semantic analysis, it seems to me, is that it has brought the structural totality of language to our attention and thereby has pointed out the limitations of the false ideal of unambiguous signs or symbols and of the potential of language for logical formalization. (Hans-Georg Gadamer, 'Semantics and Hermeneutics,' trans. P. Christopher Smith, in Hans-Georg Gadamer, Philosophical Hermeneutics, trans. and ed. David E. Linge [Berkeley: University of California Pres, 1976], p. 83).\n\n53. Simon, 'On Order in Analogical Sets,' p. 139. From his papers archived in the Jacques Maritain Center at the University of Notre Dame, we learn that Simon planned to take up just this question in a book on analogy with the working title'The Science of the Unknown,' of which the paper'On Order in Analogical Sets' would constitute one chapter. Yves R. Simon Papers, 1920-1959, University of Notre Dame, Box 2, Folder 18. 54. L. M. de Rijk, Logica Modernorum: A Contribution to the History of Early Terminist Logic. Vol. 1: On the Twelfth Century Theories of Fallacy (Assen: Van Gorcum and Company, 1962), p. 22:\n\nIn the course of the present study it will become evident that the frequent occurrence of fallacies is not just a concomitant-as a reader of the Summulae might think-, but that the doctrine of fallacy forms the basis of terminist logic. For this logic developed as a result of the fact that, to a much greater extent than it had been done by Abailard and his contemporaries, the proposition was beginning to be subjected to a strictly linguistic analysis.\n\nIntroduction to Medieval Logic, explains:\n\nIt was not uncommon for medieval logicians to begin their logic textbooks, at least those of their textbooks containing comprehensive accounts of logic, by considering terms first, and then reaching their study of inferences by way of an analysis of propositions.... But the fact that certain logicians adopted this order of exposition should not be taken to signify that they would have rejected the notion that terms, or at least some terms, should be expounded by reference to the role they play in valid inferences. On the contrary, their practice shows that they accepted this point. 55\n\nIn fact, the very issue of the unity of the analogical concept arises out of a concern to account for certain kinds of inferences; in the face of Scotus's arguments that non-univocal terms subject potential syllogisms to the fallacy of equivocation, Thomists felt obliged to explain how a nonunivocal term could preserve the validity of a syllogism. In this sense, the discussion of the semantics of analogical terms, by Cajetan and others, grows out of a concern to account for certain kinds of arguments; acts of simple apprehension are discussed because of their role in predications and inferences-that is, because of their role in judgments. The discussion of the semantics of analogical terms, then, like much of medieval logic, can be seen as arising from sophisms and the intention to avoid them. Understood in this way, the discussion of analogous terms is of a piece with the rest of the project of the logica moderna as understood by De Rijk, and described by Norman Kretzmann:\n\nPerhaps the logica moderna was aimed originally at nothing more than providing ad hoc rules of inference to cover problematic locutions in ordinary discourse, but, although it retained that aim throughout its three-hundred year history, its principal aim soon became the development of a reasonably general account of the different ways in which words are used to stand for things and to operate on other words. 56\n\nHowever, elsewhere de Rijk does indicate that he believes that'the contextual approach' to language and'the doctrine of signification' are in tension; vide L. M. de Rijk'The Origins of the Theory of the Properties of Terms,' The Cambridge History of Later Medieval Philosophy (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1982), pp. 161-73.\n\n55.

Paul Edwards [New York: Macmillan, 1967], 7: 371). See also E. J. Ashworth, 'Logic, Medieval,' ¬ß 4: 'Indeed, the avoidance of fallacy is at the heart of all new types of logical writing.'\n\n## 258\n\n## Cajetan's Hermeneutic Sophistication\n\nA semantics of terms is not only theoretically compatible with a concern for judgment and context, it is, in fact, compatible in Cajetan's own philosophical work. Although one would not know it from the above criticisms, De Nominum Analogia, in the often-neglected later chapters, deals with inferences: the tenth chapter covers reasoning using analogous terms ( Qualiter de analogo sit scientia ); and the eleventh chapter offers warnings about understanding and using analogous terms ( De cautelis necessariis circa analogorum nominum intellectum et usum ). 57\n\nIndeed, this final chapter ends with a passage that explicitly speaks to the concern that analogy is always a matter of context. Cajetan here anticipates some possible confusions about analogous usage. After considering them individually, he concludes with a general warning:\n\nWhence if someone does not wish to err, he ought habitually to consider the occasion of the speech, and recall that he will apply the conditions of the extremes to the mean; thus indeed it will be easy to explain everything soundly, and to follow the truth. 58\n\nIn other words, Cajetan explicitly reminds his readers that the proper sense of a term depends on the particular occasion of its use; when interpreting a term in an argument, one must be aware of the purpose of the argument. Far from recommending that the sense of the argument be determined from a prior analysis of its terms, Cajetan is reminding his readers that the only way to avoid mistakes in interpreting terms is to keep in mind the larger dialectical context in which those terms play a role.\n\nSuch a point is rather obvious, and hardly incompatible with a discussion of the semantics of terms, even analogous terms. Indeed, even if Cajetan hadnotincludedthis explicit acknowledgment of the importance of context in his treatise on analogy, his own practice would have implicitly affirmed his recognition of it. Cajetan wrote many commentaries, and even by 1498, when he wrote De Nominum Analogia, he had written commentaries on Porphyry's Isagoge, on Aquinas's De Ente et Essentia, and on several of Aristotle's logical works. In each of these, his interpretation of terms is consistently sensitive to the context of the arguments in which they are used. Even later, when he was writing his commentary on Aquinas's Summa Theologiae, Cajetan still often referred readers to his analysis of analogous terms in De Nominum Analogia; and yet in that commentary, Cajetan's remarks on\n\n57.

Indeed, it would be more correct to say that it is precisely Cajetan's concern with acts of judgment and with the inferential context of propositions that led him to analyze concepts.\n\n## IV. CONCLUSION\n\nIn sum, the criticisms leveled against a semantic analysis of analogy, and against Cajetan's discussion of analogical concepts, do point to important truths about the limits of a semantic analysis of terms. However, they simply fail to condemn Cajetan's approach to analogy. Context is important to analogy, because analogical signification does not take place outside of particular judgments expressed in propositions, which themselves usually must be understood in larger dialectical contexts such as inferences. But Cajetan does not ignore this. His attention to the signification of terms, and to the concepts which mediate such signification, does not imply that context and judgment are irrelevant; indeed, it is partly motivated by the recognition that particularly important dialectical contexts, such as the arguments of metaphysicians, need to be better understood, and even defended.\n\nSo the historical lesson is, first, that Cajetan's concern with the'concept' is not exclusively Scotistic nor otherwise un-Thomistic. Moreover, far from polluting Cajetan's theory, Scotus's influence clarifies the propriety, and precipitates the necessity, of a semantic analysis of analogy. Interpreters of De Nominum Analogia need to remember that Cajetan's concern with concepts is motivated by an attempt to develop a semantic analysis of analogy that will do justice to certain inferential contexts. In particular, Cajetan wants to account for the possibility of syllogisms mediated by analogical terms, syllogisms, common in metaphysics and theology, which depend on a judgment of non-univocal similarity.\n\nThereis a larger, philosophical lesson here as well, about the theoretical alternatives available to philosophical semantics. The criticisms considered here all assume that semantic principles which are conceptualist and compositionalist are also necessarily reductionist. As we have seen, however, it is possible to analyze propositions as if their meanings depended on their component terms, yet without insisting that those meanings are predetermined by fixed meanings that those terms have independently of sentential and\n\n59. Thephenomenonreally is ubiquitous, but one example of Cajetan's careful clarification of terms with respect to the role they play in the context of particular arguments is his commentary on ST Ia, q. 3, a. 3, which is discussed in Joshua P. Hochschild, 'A Note on Cajetan's Theological Semantics,' Sapientia 54 (1999): 367-76.\n\ninferential context. Cajetan, at least, worked with a semantic framework that was conceptualist and compositionalist, but also organicist. That is (to draw an analogy), for Cajetan, a proposition is related to its component terms much as an organism is related to its organs. The function of the whole depends on the functions of the parts, but the functions of the parts are also determined by, and in some sense depend on, the function of the whole. To speak more precisely, the general principle of semantic dependence of wholes on parts-compositionality-does not itself establish the semantic values of the parts. The semantic values of the parts must be determined by interpretation, with attention to context; and there is nothing about semantic compositionality that rules out-indeed we have seen that, for Cajetan, it presupposes-the hermeneutic dependence of parts on wholes.\n\nArgument map:"

The purpose of this paper is to re-examine the debate about cinematic motion in terms of the necessity for reception conditions in art. I shall argue that Gregory Currie's rejection of weak illusionism-the view that cinematic motion is illusory-is sound, because cinematic images really move, albeit in a responsedependent rather than garden-variety manner. In ¬ß1 I present Andrew Kania's rigorous and compelling critique of Currie's realism. I assess Trevor Ponech's response to Kania in ¬ß2, and show that his focus on the cinematic experience is indicative of the direction the debate should take. ¬ß3 demonstrates that the issue is underpinned by the question of the role of reception conditions in the experience of art. In ¬ß4 I apply my observations on reception conditions to the problem of cinematic motion and conclude that Kania's objections are unsuccessful due to his failure to acknowledge the necessary conditions for cinematic experience.\n\n## 1. The Illusion of Realism\n\nGregory Currie produced the first comprehensive philosophy of film in the analytic tradition with Image and Mind in 1995, and identified the essence of film as'moving pictures' (Currie, 1997, p. 47). His ontology of film is strictly realist, and he rejects both cognitive and perceptual illusionism in film. In cognitive or strong illusionism the viewer believes that she occupies the position of the camera, and is therefore present in the story. Currie correctly notes that audiences neither react nor think in this way, and dismisses the'Imagined Observer Hypothesis ' (Currie, 1995, p. 167). 1 In perceptual or weak illusionism, cinematic experience represents the world in a particular way, even though the viewer knows this to be false, and the thesis is that the movement of images onscreen is illusory in this sense. Currie's rejection of this claim is highly controversial, with both illusionists and realists appealing to an intuitive view of cinematic motion. In'The Illusion of Realism in Film' Kania refers to the'common-sense' view of the illusion of movement (Kania, 2002, p. 243), and film theorists and critics seem to take it for granted that the succession of still frames in film\n\n1 Currie also refers to this hypothesis as imagining seeing.\n\nproduce an illusion of continuous motion. On the other hand, Currie (1995, p. 38) maintains that the burden of proof lies with the illusionists, and his argument against perceptual illusionism is supported by aestheticians such as Berys Gaut (1998, p. 331) 2 and Dominic McIver Lopes (1998, p. 347).\n\nAlthough Kania endorses Currie's theory of film, and his general position on cinematic realism, he believes that the rejection of perceptual illusionism is unjustified. He begins with the accurate observation that Currie fails to present an argument for realism, merely arguing against illusionism. 3 An apparently even more telling criticism is that Currie equivocates between proposing'garden-variety motion possessed by such things as my bicycle as I ride to school' and'special response-dependent motion' (Kania, 2002, p. 247). Garden-variety motion is characterised by an object occupying'contiguous spatial locations at contiguous moments in time' (Kania, 2002, p. 250). Film is not analogous because there are twentyfour discrete impacts of light on the screen each second rather than a continuity of light on the screen as the images (appear to) move. In describing the cinematic image as produced by the'continuous impact of light on screen,' Currie (1995, p. 41) has thus made'a simple factual error' (Kania, 2002, p. 250).\n\nI am not convinced that Currie ever proposes garden-variety motion, although he does vacillate between a strong and a weak sense of'real'(Currie, 1997, p. 44). Fundamentally, he believes that the movement of images is analogous to-even like-the property of colour. Movement and colour are both real, but also dependent on a psychological reaction, and thus extrinsic (Currie, 1995, p. 32). Colours are not an illusion because I am not in error when I see red in the Tricolore. 'Roughly, for things to be red they merely have to look red to us in normal conditions' (Currie, 1997, p. 47). In discussing cinematic motion as response-dependent, Currie addresses the objection from the M√ºller-Lyer illusion: if cinematic motion is a'veridical experience of a response-dependent property' a parallel argument could be constructed for the illusion created by the M√ºller-Lyer as veridical (1995, p. 44). Thus the experience of the two lines'is not the metrical property of objects we measure with rigid rods, but rather a response-dependent length,' and one's perception of this responsedependent length is regarded as veridical (Currie, 1995, p. 44). Both the M√ºller-Lyer illusion and cinematic motion involve perception independent of belief and the problem for Currie is that regarding response-dependent motion as real has the consequence of dismissing a paradigmatic illusion.\n\nCurrie's answer identifies the difference between the M√ºller-Lyer and cinematic motion as being that the appearance of the former suggests that\n\n2 Recently, however, Gaut has rejected Currie's view. See Gaut, 2010, p. 65.\n\n3 For the sake of brevity I shall henceforth use illusionism to refer to perceptual (or weak) illusionism, and realism for the opposing view.\n\nan independent check, e.g. conventional measurement, would reveal an illusion; the experience of film does not, however, suggest that an independent check-e.g. slowing down the projector speed-would reveal the movement as illusory. This is a very weak defence, because no convincing illusion draws attention to its illusory nature. Furthermore, Kania explains why slowing down the projector speed so that it produces a succession of still images is exactly analogous to measuring the lines of the M√ºller-Lyer:\n\nThe point is that once you have understood what is going on at the lower level of the mechanics of projection‚Ä¶you will change your mind about what to say at the higher level of perception of the normally projected film. (Kania, 2002, p. 249)\n\nThe M√ºller-Lyer is a paradigmatic perceptual illusion, and it seems as if cinematic motion belongs to the same category.\n\nCurrie's conception of the movement of images is essential to his claim that there is real movement onscreen, and is contested by Kania on the basis that Currie creates a false dichotomy. Kania agrees with Currie that there is no illusion of physical objects in motion onscreen, but rejects his alternative of a veridical experience of images in motion. 'An obvious third possibility is that we have an illusion of images moving in front of us' (Kania, 2002, p. 252). Kania believes the key to Currie's position is ascertaining whether the images themselves are reidentifiable objects, and-if so-whether they move. He refers to Currie's refutation of the argument from wave motion. This objection to realism is that the appeal to response dependence in cinematic motion has the undesirable consequence that the movement of a wave is real. There is no single, reidentifiable object in a wave, however, only a transfer of energy from molecule to molecule. Currie (1995, p. 45) claims that the cases are different because the body of water is a physical object which we perceive to be moving (spreading) as a wave. In cinematic motion, there is no physical object that moves, i.e. no illusion of movement; there is the real movement of an image.\n\nKania's concern is that Currie first disassociates the image from the object it represents in order to show that there is no illusion taking place, and then assumes that this image is'a single reidentifiable thing' and thus not an illusion itself (Kania, 2002, p. 253). He presents a highly entertaining example of a dialogue between Paul (an illusionist) and Vince (a realist), who have just watched a film where John Wayne strides across the screen (Kania, 2002, pp. 253-254). Both Paul and Vince agree that they were watching an image of Wayne walking, but Vince holds that the image itself moved. When Paul slows the speed of the projection down, it is clear that the images are different, e.g., one shows the left side of Wayne's face and the next his whole face from the front. Vince then admits that the\n\nreidentifiable image itself is an illusion created by the speed of the projection, and thus that cinematic motion is an illusion of successive images. Currie's recourse to images rather than objects is therefore not enough to save his position: all movement on the screen is illusory.\n\n## 2. The Reality of Stroboscopic Motion\n\nAlthough Ponech's'External Realism about Cinematic Motion' is a response to Kania, he maintains that his view is closer to Kania's than Currie's, as he agrees that cinematic motion is external and prior to the interpretation of information by the mind (Ponech, 2006, p. 368). Ponech identifies the essence of the debate as being'whether the image undergoes objective displacement, that is, moves continuously in a contiguous space, independent of any perceptual uptake' (Ponech, 2006, p. 354). His intended solution is extremely ambitious: to show, contra Kania and Currie, that cinematic images exhibit garden-variety motion (Ponech, 2006, p. 355).\n\nPonech differentiates visual displays from display formats, and demonstrates that the former possess two essential properties, pixels and stroboscopic motion. Stroboscopic motion:\n\ndenotes the continuous transformations a display undergoes, transformations partly constitutive of it. A display is more than a static field of pixels. It is also a course of events. Periods of illumination alternate with periods of nonillumination; the pixels' brightness and intensity fluctuate‚Ä¶This flashing is the display's stroboscopic motion. (Ponech, 2006, p. 357)\n\nThe stroboscopic motion of pixels produces and sustains cinematic imagesof-things, e.g. W, the image-of-John-Wayne:\n\nW is a singleton. 'Singleton' designates a visible structure standing out from its background and other such structures in its vicinity. As such it is one perceptual target, perhaps among many, present in the display space. Like any singleton it is not an abstract entity but a tangible object of experience. Viewers are in sensory contact with it and have perceptual representations which are about it. (Ponech, 2006, p. 360)\n\nThe stroboscopic motion of singletons forms the basis of Ponech's theory and while he admits that singletons do not move in the same way as bicycles, he believes that they meet Kania's criteria for garden-variety motion because they occupy contiguous spatial locations at contiguous moments in time. Thus: 'The singleton, W, undergoes objective displacement within the visual display,' a process Ponech calls'continuous stroboscopic displacement ' (Ponech, 2006, p. 362). The claim that W does not exhibit garden-variety motion is an arbitrary restriction of the term because W moves as follows:\n\nIt does not achieve objective displacement in the same way its depictum did‚Ä¶It does so through the mechanism of stroboscopy. W's change of position from L to L n is a visible, stroboscopically generated occurrent event in the display space. (Ponech, 2006, p. 365)\n\nSingletons are real perceptual objects and their continuous stroboscopic displacement is real movement. When an observer has a cinematic experience of a singleton in motion, therefore, there is no illusion involved.\n\n'Singletons' are Ponech's technical term for Currie's identification of an image of a particular as a'particular reidentifiable thing' (Currie, 1996, p. 340). Currie claims that there are'images of reidentifiable physical objects moving in front of our eyes,' as opposed to the objects themselves (Currie, 1996, p. 338). (The exception is, of course, animation, where the images are not of physical objects. 4 ) Cinematic technology produces the particular reidentifiable thing onscreen, and Currie believes that this thing really moves:\n\nWe see a cinematic image of a man, and we see that it is in one place on the screen, and we later see that it is in another; indeed, we see that image move from one place to another on the screen. (Currie, 1995, pp. 40-41)\n\nI shall henceforth use Ponech's term when discussing this type of image. Kania denies the existence of singletons, 5 and I present the three characterisations of cinematic motion as follows:\n\nPonech: the motion of singletons is objectively real. Currie: the motion of singletons is subjectively real (because it is response-dependent, like colour). Kania: singletons and cinematic motion are illusory (and thus response- dependent).\n\nI do not wish to discuss the ontological status of singletons in detail, so I shall restrict my observations to the obvious: if one considers their reality in terms of existence and independence, they are different to bicycles. In his description of stroboscopic motion, Ponech notes: 'This type of motion is not to be confused with objective displacement. Pixels do not roll across the screen like billiard balls' (Ponech, 2006, p. 357). But the motion of bicycles and billiard balls is exactly the kind of motion to which Kania is referring when he discusses garden-variety motion. He is quite clear that for'normal' or garden-variety motion there must be: (1) an object, and (2) that object must occupy contiguous spatial locations at contiguous moments in time (Kania, 2002, p. 250). The absence of the object is Kania's reason for\n\n4 See: Currie 1995, p. 41; Currie 1996, p. 340; and Kania, 2002, p. 252.\n\n5 I address his objection in ¬ß4.\n\nclaiming that there is no garden-variety movement in the cinema, as opposed to the theatre (Kania, 2002, p. 248).\n\nSingletons do move by occupying contiguous spatial locations at continuous moments in time. They are not, however, objects. And because they are not objects they do not move objectively, as Ponech states. I present three examples, applied to the motion of objects and singletons respectively:\n\n- (1) I watch Dr Kania cycle to school. - (2) My dog watches Dr Kania cycle to school. - (3) Dr Kania cycles to school. 4. (1*) I watch my television screen while W moves across it. 5. (2*) My dog watches my television screen while W moves across it. 6. (3*) W moves across my television screen.\n\nWhat happens in (1) to (3)? There is garden-variety motion in all cases: an object, a man on his bicycle, moves contiguously. At a particular point in time, man and bicycle are at home; at a subsequent point in time, man and bicycle are at school. The presence or absence of observers human or canine makes no difference to the sequence of events that result in the object arriving at school. In (1*), I watch W move contiguously. It is not clear what happens in (2*), suffice to say that my dog does not perceive W. All we can really say about (2*) and (3*) therefore, are that pixels (really) flash. Like Locke's secondary qualities these flashing pixels have the power to produce W in a being which has the relevant perceptual apparatus. But the sequence of events that take W from one side of the screen to the other only occurs when it is perceived by me. When I am present, pixels flash and W moves across the screen; when I am absent, pixels flash.\n\nWhile Ponech has shown that singletons move in the same way as objects-contiguously in space and time-he cannot show that they exhibit garden-variety motion because they are not objects. His reference to a singleton as a'perceptual object' reinforces the point (Ponech, 2006, p. 367). A singleton is a perceptual object only for beings that possess the appropriate perceptual apparatus. I have that apparatus, my dog does not. My dog can see the bicycle, but does not see the same colour as I see. Ponech notes that singletons are not abstract entities but tangible objects of experience. The unstated difference here is between tangible objects and tangible objects of experience. Tangible objects like bicycles appear to have an independent existence, but tangible objects of experience like singletons appear to remain a potentiality until a creature with the matching perceptual apparatus experiences them. In Ponech's terms, therefore: W's movement is internal; the flashing pixels are external.\n\nIt seems as if the debate, which is a very specific issue within a subcategory of philosophy of art, has exhausted itself. I think there is more to\n\nsay, however, and that Ponech indicates the direction the enquiry should take when he denies that Kania's slowing down of the film projector demonstrates illusionism:\n\nReductionism thus mistakenly believes we glimpse cinema's true nature by slowing or freezing the exhibition machinery. All we thereby glimpse is a quasi-cinematic display momentarily deprived of one of its ontological primitives. (Ponech, 2006, p. 359)\n\nThe second sentence suggests that a necessary condition for cinematic experience is absent. In what follows, I shall focus on film and music, although-as my brief examples of literature and painting show-the issue of reception conditions is relevant to all art.\n\n## 3. Reception Conditions for Art Forms\n\nKania's argument against Currie relies upon a single contention, the connection between the succession of still images that constitute the medium of film, and the perception of the moving images on the screen. He summarises his position: 'Yet again we can see that film's frame-by-frame nature forces us to deny that its images really move, in any standard sense' (Kania, 2002, pp. 250-251). This is simply not the case, however, as I shall demonstrate. Kania makes an error when he states that'the number of frames per second is irrelevant to the necessary condition of paradigmatic movement' (Kania, 2002, p. 257). There is no mystery or trickery in film projection: static frames are projected at the speed of twenty-four frames per second (fps) because this is the optimum speed at which human beings perceive motion onscreen. This perception is caused by persistence of vision and the phi phenomena. The former consists in the brain's retention of images on the retina for a fraction of a second after the removal of the stimulus; the latter is the phenomenon that causes the rotating blades of a fan to appear as a complete circle at certain speeds. The speed of projection thus operates so as to guarantee that the audience will experience a film and not a slide show, and won't see dark intervals between the frames. Projection at 24 fps is therefore a necessary condition for the reception of the art form of film by an audience.\n\nI propose an analogy with a non-visual art, namely music. I can experience, e.g., Holst's The Planets in a number of ways, from attending a live performance to playing a record or CD, or downloading it onto my MP3 player. In each case, there are various factors that count towards me experiencing Holst, such as the instruments used to produce the music and the ability of the musicians to follow the score faithfully. If I attended a performance where'Mars, the Bringer of War' was played on a didgeridoo, I could not be said to have experienced Holst. Nor would I have the\n\nexperience if I played a faulty CD where all I could hear was the whirring of the disk in the player. I would not have the musical or aesthetic experience of Holst if I played a 33‚Öì revolutions per minute (rpm) record of The Planets at 45 rpm either. I would hear sounds, perhaps even music, but not Holst, and certainly not have an aesthetic experience.\n\nThe presentation and appreciation of art involves different types of media and different reception conditions. Art forms are not necessarily restricted to a particular medium, but whatever medium is used determines the necessary conditions for an audience to be able to experience the work. It seems that many-if not most-of these are so obvious that they frequently escape notice. Remaining with non-visual art, I would not have the experience of James Joyce's Ulysses if I read a word a day. In fact, even at the rate of a word an hour, every hour, the novel would take about thirty years to complete. The literary experience differs for each person, but there is a requirement that a work be consumed regularly, and with short enough intervals that one's memory and understanding can function appropriately. Visual arts have similarly obvious reception conditions: I wouldn't be able to fully appreciate Picasso's Les Demoiselles D'Avignon if I lay on the floor to look at it, or if the light was too dark for me to make out the depiction. Reception conditions for the experience of paintings require sufficient light and a view with as little of an angle as possible, i.e. from directly in front, at approximately eye-level.\n\nI think the analogy between film and music is forceful. First, I can have the aesthetic experience of Orson Welles' Citizen Kane in a number of ways, and this experience is not reliant upon a specific medium. I can attend a performance of the film, watch it on video on my television, or watch it on my computer on the train. As with a musical performance, certain reception conditions must prevail in order for me to have the experience, and there may be arguments advanced as to the ideal conditions for the ideal experience, e.g. watching the film in a theatre, where the light is at an optimum level and the screen is an optimum size. Second, there are circumstances where I will not actually have the Citizen Kane experience. Significantly, those circumstances include watching the film at 1 fps and 48 fps: in fact, at any speed other than the 24 fps at which it was designed to be shown. I did not experience Holst at 45 rpm, and I do not experience Welles at 45 fps. Ponech's description of a quasi-cinematic display is therefore entirely accurate.\n\nThe experience of film is the experience of seeing moving images under specific perceptual circumstances (e.g., 24 fps on a white screen in a dark room), which are necessary for the experience. This conception of the cinematic experience results in a serious problem for Kania. As the art form is independent of the specific medium used in production, the nature of cinematic motion must be considered independently from the means used to\n\nproduce the motion. The view that the illusory nature of film can be proved by slowing the projector down is thus doubly fallacious: because there are-or could be-other methods of producing the work, and because once the conditions for aesthetic experience and perception are changed, one can no longer be said to experience the work of art. With this in mind, I return to Currie's theory of perceptual realism.\n\n## 4. The Myth of Illusion\n\nI agree with Kania's scepticism of claims that put the burden of proof on the opposing argument, but Currie seems correct in this instance. If one is considering perception in general, or any particular aspect thereof, the default setting is that humans with fully functioning senses perceive reality rather than illusion. If you want me to believe that the lines in the M√ºllerLyer illusion are equal in length, then you must demonstrate the fact. It looks like the one is longer than the other, and until the illusion is revealed to me, I assume my perception is veridical. Similarly, it seems to me that film consists of moving pictures. If the pictures do not move, then I require convincing. While I acknowledge that Currie's failure to provide an argument for the reality of movement is indeed a weakness, I still accept that it is the illusion that requires proof.\n\nIn Image and Mind Currie's'view is simply that cinematic motion is real in the weak sense,' meaning that the movement is real as opposed to illusory (Currie, 1995, p. 44). He thus accepts that cinematic motion is not real in the strong sense, where real is contrasted with illusory and apparent. Subsequently, however, he admits to being unable to decide which sense of real is applicable to cinematic motion, and offers support for both (Currie, 1997, p. 47). All of Currie's arguments rely on the comparison of the reality of cinematic movement with the reality of colour, but the suggestion that the movement is real in the strong sense is an alignment with Ponech's external realism. In perceiving motion onscreen one would not normally admit to being deceived (as by the M√ºller-Lyer illusion), but one might well think that the movement, like the colours, was apparent rather than independently real. I have rejected Ponech's theory in ¬ß2, and I shall therefore interpret Currie's thesis as allowing for real movement in the weak sense, i.e. that movement is real, but an instance of responsedependent movement.\n\nIn this case, Kania's objection to Currie's handling of the M√ºller-Lyer counter-example must be addressed. An uninformed glance at the M√ºllerLyer wouldn't provoke a desire to measure the lines any more than watching a film provokes the desire to slow down the projection speed. If, however, I decide that I require an independent check, then-as Kania states-slowing down the projection speed seems entirely appropriate. Such\n\na check would indeed show that the work of art I am appreciating is produced by the projection of a series of static images, but the act of checking (the slowing down of these images) would mean a departure from the appreciation of the work itself. Measuring the M√ºller-Lyer lines shows that the illusion is produced by the arrows, and slowing down the rate of projection shows that a film is produced by a series of static images. But Currie, Kania, and Ponech are concerned with the art of film and that art involves certain necessary reception conditions, one of which is projection at 24 fps. Watching the film at a different speed may be educational or entertaining, but is no longer an experience of the work of art.\n\nIn addressing the counter-example of the wave, Currie holds that where the body of water is a physical object that appears to move, there is no physical object in cinematic motion, only a singleton. Kania rejects this concept. In his dialogue, he has Paul present John Wayne frame-by-frame to show that the image is different in each frame. I cannot accept this argument because it involves a departure from the reception conditions of the film, but I offer another on Kania's behalf. There is a particularly effective sequence of about thirty seconds in Agust√≠n D√≠az Yanes' Alatriste (2006), where Captain Alatriste meets his archenemy, Gualterio Malatesta. The scene begins with an oblique view of a narrow alley: Alatriste enters bottom right and walks away from the camera. He stops and turns back to the camera, whereupon the view changes to a shot of his body from the front, with the camera zooming slowly in to his face. The audience then sees Alatriste's point of view as a herd of sheep trot around the corner. The shot returns to Alatriste's face, follows his hand as he draws his dagger, and the prologue to Malatesta's entrance finishes with a close-up of the tension on Alatriste's face. The image at the beginning, of Alatriste's broadbrimmed hat and cloak seen from behind and above, is completely different from the close-up frontal shot of his face at the end. Although the sequence either follows Alatriste or his point of view throughout, it clearly begins and ends with two different images. Kania claims that images are not singletons, and cannot therefore really move.\n\nThe experience of film, however, provides evidence to the contrary. When I watch the above sequence, I don't see Viggo Mortensen onscreen because the camera is not transparent. I see a two-dimensional cinematic representation of Mortensen (and Captain Alatriste), and this representation takes the form of an image that changes hundreds-or perhaps thousandsof times during the film. As Currie notes, 'no particular light wave or particle is more than minutely constitutive of it' (Currie, 1995, p. 41). I wasn't confused when the camera switched from the view of Mortensen's silhouette emerging from the shadows to a close-up of his face because I recognised the image of the actor throughout; this recognition occurs because the representative image is reidentifiable. In motion pictures-as\n\nopposed to photographs-there is no paradox in the image both changing and remaining the same. If I am shown two photographs of John Wayne taken from different angles, I will call them different. Show me a film where he strides across the screen, and I will say that the singleton W moved. Slow the film down or speed it up as much as you like, but if we're talking about cinema then I expect images to move, and movement means change.\n\nThe point is that the discussion is about film and Currie has already identified film as essentially moving pictures. Definitions may differ, but there is general agreement that film consists of a depiction of some sort (be it a shadow, photograph, picture, or image) which moves, 6 i.e. depiction and motion are essential to the art form. Kania's objection fails because cinematic motion is the real movement of singletons. This movement is apparent (i.e., response dependent), but it is not illusory (i.e., deceptive). The fact that cinematic motion is produced by static frames shows only that a certain speed of projection-24 fps-is a reception condition of the art form. Once one departs from that projection speed, one is no longer experiencing the art form, which is where the analogy with the M√ºller-Lyer illusion breaks down. Ponech's attempt to prove that singletons exhibit garden-variety motion also fails. They may indeed move contiguously in space and time, but they are not objects and differ from objects in that their existence is dependent on perception. I conclude, therefore, that Currie's theory of cinematic motion is the most plausible of the three options.\n\n## References\n\nCarroll, N. (1996). Defining the Moving Image.

        "user_prompt": "Philosophy paper text:\n## SPENSER'S POETIC PHENOMENOLOGY: HUMANISM AND THE RECOVERY OF PLACE\n\nThe present paper defends the thesis that Spenser's recovery of place, as enacted in The Faerie Queene, Book VI, can be linked in a direct way to his use of a poetic phenomenology which informs and clarifies his work as an epic writer. Traditional humanism is sometimes defined as an attempt to appropriate the meaning of classical art and literature in terms of \"timeless\" philosophical truths. Spenser's originality as a Renaissance poet, however, has much to do with his use of literary pro‚Ä∫ cedures that express but also complicate his relationship to traditional humanism. While the heart of Spenser's \"Book of Courtesy\" enacts a Neo-Platonic movement from the lower levels of temporal existence to an exalted vision of spiritual perfection, this same section can be read along phenomenological lines as a mysterious adventure that embraces self and other, personality and community, aesthetics and ethics, in a sequence of images that opens up a new interpretation of imaginative ful‚Ä∫ fillment. 1 The burden of this paper, therefore, is largely concerned with demonstrating how this poetic sequence instates the \"truth\" of place in a way that is inseparable from the meaning of Spenser's humanism. 2\n\nSpenser's celebration of Courtesy as a virtue involves an apprecia‚Ä∫ tion of social values as well as a commitment to transcendent notions of Good. This peculiar combination cannot be understood apart from a dialectical appraisal of Spenser's view of nature. This view embraces two extremes. On the one hand, Spenser identifies nature with the principle of fecundity and abundance. According to this view, which mainly derives from Aristotle, nature is a visible source of human values. In the Garden of Adonis, for instance, nature emerges as a productive force and a spectacular point of origin (III.vi.42). On the other hand, Spenser also maintains that nature can function as the invisible source of moral virtue. This more Platonic conception informs his representation of major char‚Ä∫ acters, and also influences his critical attitude toward pagan mythology.3\n\nThe difference between these two conceptions of nature can be under‚Ä∫ stood in terms of the tension that governs The Faerie Queene as a whole. The Aristotelian conception is more closely related to traditional conceptions of political authority. At the beginning of Book VI, for\n\n35\n\nA-T. Tymieniecka (ed.), Analecta Husserliana XLIV, 35-44. ' 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.\n\ninstance, courtesy as a virtue is associated with the reign of Queen Elizabeth (Vl.proem 6, line 4). Thus Spenser seems to associate courtesy as a virtue with the legitimate rule of a contemporary monarch. At the end of Book VI, however, the idea of pastoral as a place of magic and innocence reinforces the Platonic conception of nature, and suggests that Spenser does not wish to derive virtue from either a limited expe‚Ä∫ rience of nature or from basically political arrangements.\n\nThe idea that virtue can be institutional as well as basic to human com‚Ä∫ munities underlines Spenser's epic narrative as a recovery of place which happens in language and ultimately concerns the movement of the soul toward imaginative fulfillment. 4 In the introductory stanzas of his epic, Spenser wishes to establish the connection between courtesy and everyday concerns. While courtesy as a virtue belongs in the hall of princes, it is also said to be \"the ground, lAnd root of ciuill conuersa‚Ä∫ tion\" (VI.i.1, lines 1-6). Spenser indicates in this way that courtesy goes beyond specific political interests and penetrates the very language of civilized life.\n\nAn early allusion to the meaning of courtesy invokes the figure of Calidore, whose \"gracious speach, did steale men's hearts away\" (VI.i.2, line 6). However, Spenser also refers to \"the triall of true curtesie\" where an ecclesiastical court must pass sentence on a loveless Mirabella (Vl.proem.5, lines 1-2). The illusions of the world are often mistaken for ideal beauty: \"But vertues seat is deepe within the mynd, lAnd not in outward shows, but inward thoughts defynd\" (Vl.poem.5, lines 8-9). Hence Spenser rejects a narrowly political conception of virtue in order to affirm the importance of subjectivity to moral understanding. Primarily for this reason, I wish to contend that the figure of Calidore takes part in a phenomenological movement toward spiritual insight. s\n\nWhile functioning as a counter to pure nature and its attendant virtue, Calidore must discover the relationship between the wisdom of humanity and the demands of political life. Near the beginning of his adventures, we learn about the \"innate gifts\" of Calidore: his honesty and love of truth are commended (VI.i.3, line 9). The philosophical basis for this combination of talents can be found in Castiglione's Book of the Courtier. Here Gasparo explains to Ottaviano that certain important virtues cannot be learned: \"but I think that to those who have them they have been given by nature and by God.,,6 Calidore's moral education within the epic context takes the form of a \"recollection\" of virtue that allows him to partially overcome the difference between nature and politics.\n\nUnlike other heroes in Spenser's epic, Calidore is absent from the center of his own text: Calidore disappears at the end of canto ii and does not re-appear prior to canto ix. It would seem that Calepine in some way substitutes for him during the interim. As a much less skillful Calidore, Calepine tries to perform the function of the traditional hero. However, his presence never ceases to remind us of Calidore's absence. Because he lacks the manifest qualities of the traditional hero, Calidore's virtue is credible and unobtrusive.\n\nCalidore helps us see that \"courtesy\" is probably the Spenserian form of Aristotle's \"near-friendliness\": it, too, properly belongs to the man who is neither subservient nor disagreeable. 7 Occupying the mean between two extremes, courtesy thus defined is a kind of goodwill that enables us to relate to everyone in a like manner: \"Eunoia or goodwill bears some resemblance to friendship, but is not in fact friendship, for we may feel goodwill towards strangers and persons who are not aware of our feeling a thing impossible between friends.\"s However, while it draws strangers into its warm embrace, courtesy also might be a pre‚Ä∫ condition for the emergence of more exalted forms of experience. Aristotle clearly understood the possible connection between the expe‚Ä∫ rience of beauty and the attainment of spiritual truth: \"Nobody falls in love who has not been first delighted by the sight of beauty, although it does not follow that a man who is delighted by the beauty of a person is in love.,,9\n\nAt the beginning of Book VI, we retreat from the plains, mountains and rocky coast and enter the wood of Faerie land. The scene of courtesy is a pastoral countryside. Violence and sadness pervade this world of archaic values: \"There is an older tradition of'gentilesse' derived from Provence and France, running through medieval romance literature, which had its rules and casuistry too, but expressed itself chiefly in actual example and a pervading chivalrous tone.,,10 The tradition of courtesy, however, can involve the sudden appearance of various truths. Harry Berger contends that the repetition of specific motifs structures Book VI as a whole: \"The most frequently repeated motif is, signifi‚Ä∫ cantly enough, that of a character surprised in a moment of diversion.,,11 All such moments must be understood within a moral context. For instance, the motif of the interrupted couple occurs twice (VI.ii.16-17; VI.iii.20-23). Each time, the discovery of love moves us closer to the vision of Mount Acidale. Many scenes of recognition must precede the great unveiling near the end of the Book of Courtesy (VI.x.27-28).\n\nThe trial of Mirabella establishes the low point in the history of courtesy. It precedes the slow ascent from a discourteous world. This entire movement takes place in three episodes that are represented by three different women: \"Mirabella projects the germinal form of frus‚Ä∫ tration, Serena and her Cannibals the germinal form of desire, Pastorella and her swains the germinal form of poetic recreation, all of which are infolded and transfigured by Colin's vision.,,12 The extreme discourtesy of Mirabella results in an ecclesiastical court summons. The glorification of Serena among cannibals is the parody of a religious ceremony. Finally, the capture of Pastorella by Calidore is the prelude to the final vision of love on Mount Acidale. These three episodes have been said to imitate a Plotinian philosophy of love. However, they also might be interpreted as constituting a poetic phenomenology whereby courtesy is defined on the basis of three discontinuous moments.\n\nThe first episode dramatizes the pitfalls of immediate experience. Rejecting the moderate claims of courtesy, Mirabella uses her beauty in order to obtain power over men. Mira-bella is literally the \"look of beauty\" that enamors men and attempts to ruin them. The jury that presides over her trial condemns her to do penance: tomorrow she must walk the earth and love as many men as she formerly ruined (Vl.vii.37). Mirabella's suitors are feudal retainers of Cupid and her plea of mercy is a religious petition. Both of these facts seem to indicate that Mirabella takes part in an ecclesiastical, rather than a civil, trial. 13 This interpre‚Ä∫ tation supports the view that love (in the religious sense) is a central issue in Book VI. It also suggests that lovelessness is the supreme discour‚Ä∫ tesy in Spenser's phenomenology.\n\nIn contrast, the abduction of Serena by cannibals leads to a basic conflict in interpretations. On the one hand, we condemn the behavior of the cannibals as completely abhorrent. The abduction of Serena is par‚Ä∫ ticularly shocking insofar as it places a brutal practice in an aesthetic perspective. The cannibals who adore Serena eventually raise her \"divine\" body upon an altar of sacrifice (Vl.viii.42-45). We instinctively reject any figurative analogy between a savage practice and civilized modes of worship.\n\nThis response, however, could prevent us from coming to terms with the full meaning of the episode as an adventure in Renaissance anthro‚Ä∫ pology. Before the festivities begin, the cannibals must be restrained by a spiritual superior: it seems that \"religion held even theiues in measure\" (Vl.viii.43, line 9). Spenser's humanistic perspective allows\n\nhim to imagine genuine order in a primitive context. By directing his people to the altar, this figure seems to organize these forms into a social whole. Compared to this event, the love of Mirabella is regressive: her beauty does not \"rise\" but actually \"descends\" into a physical world: \"Spenser's transition to the cannibal ring logically reduces the sophis‚Ä∫ ticated evil to its confused origin and, in effect, allows him to begin all over again.,,14\n\nIt is probable that Spenser knew of Montaigne's famous essay on cannibals: his anthropological imagination seems to owe a great deal to it. After discussing the habits of cannibals at some length, Montaigne integrates relativism into an argument against his would-be detractors: \"I am not so anxious that we should note the horrible savagery of these acts as concerned that, whilst judging their faults correctly, we should be so blind to our own.,,15 Like Montaigne, Spenser attempts to link anthropological awareness to the potential enhancement of moral sensitivity.\n\nHence the \"raising up\" of Calidore's Pastorella both glorifies nature and prefigures its transformation (Vl.ix.8). There is an irony in this act that becomes evident in retrospect: \"In naming her, the swains reduce her from an aristocrat to a shepherdess; in worshipping her, they exalt her from an aristocrat to a goddess, identifying the symbol with the reality to which it refers.,,16 Later on, we will discover that this child of nature is really a high-born daughter (Vl.xii.20). If the cannibal ring repre‚Ä∫ sents the lowest starting-point of human culture, then the pastoral ring represents the beginning of an aesthetic departure. The poetic qualities of the ring prepare us for the reduced geometry of intellectual beauty and a less ambiguous symbolism.\n\nA further contrast is implied in the encounter between Calidore and Pastorella's protector, old Meliboe. After chasing the Blatant Beast from court to country, Calidore returns at the beginning of canto ix. His absence from the center of the poem has not gone unobserved. It created a moral vacuum that his return promises to fill. In his encounter with Meliboe, however, Calidore merge as the typical heroic protagonist. While visiting Meliboe's peasant lodging, Calidore expresses envy for the life of rural simplicity (Vl.ix.19). An \"entraunced\" Calidore momen‚Ä∫ tarily rejects his political vocation as he speaks to the wise recluse (Vl.ix.27-28). But Meliboe will have none of this, and refuses to view political life as an external achievement: \"It is the mynd, that maketh good or ill,\" he tells Calidore (Vl.ix.30, line 1). Spenser presents Meliboe\n\nas a relative contrast to the more worldly Calidore: \"Boethian stoicism was not Spenser's whole card; but neither was there any reason to doubt that he meant Meliboe's' 'sensible words' (Vl.ix.26) as the expression of one facet of an acceptable attitude.,,17\n\nPrior to the vision on Mount Acidale, Calidore fails to understand the unity of real and ideal worlds. 18 Traditionally, the figure of Calidore is associated with the name of Sir Philip Sidney. This identification lies at the basis of our optimism with respect to Calidore's future. Calidore is a man of the world whose natural gifts lift him above common ambi‚Ä∫ tions. As the exemplar of courtesy, he must mingle with others and advance the cause of virtue. But his idealism derives from an ideal court, rather than from a purely political one: \"In Book VI diplomacy is less a technique than a symbol, and Spenser does not show Calidore's exquisite tact simply in order to make him more convincing as a Renaissance courtier.,,19 Hence the \"fulfillment\" of political service requires a poetic vision of the supernatural. Nature is less resourceful than the most truthful poets: \"Her world is brazen, the poets deliver a golden.\"zo\n\nIn Spenser's epic, therefore, the return to pastoral culminates in the overcoming of nature as an external obstacle. Our first glimpse of Venus is significant in this respect: her place appears to exclude nature in its grosser aspects (Vl.x.7, lines 1-5). It is here that Calidore has his vision of the hundred dancing maidens (Vl.x.ll, lines 6-9). Three Graces appear in the center of a ring and circle a solitary figure, who wears a rose garland. Because her beauty surpasses that of all the others, she is \"that faire one/ That in the midst was placed parauaunt\" (Vl.x.15, lines 6-7). We learn from the narrator that this mysterious figure is Colin Clout's lost love: \"Thy loue is there aduaunst to be another Grace\" (Vl.x.16, lines 8-9). In a moment, this whole apparition suddenly vanishes.\n\nThe rough shepherd who has played his pipe in a fit of anger then proceeds to offer his intruder an interpretation of the vision as a whole. It is what we learn about the central figure that primarily interests us. At first glance, she is \"but a countrey lasse, /Yet she all other countrey lasses farre did pass\" (Vl.x.25, lines 8-9). Her pre-eminent beauty dis‚Ä∫ tinguishes her from all other women. From another standpoint, however, she seems to condense or contain the qualities of her companions (Vl.x.27, lines 1-3). No longer a country maiden, she finally becomes \"Great Gloriana, greatest maiesry\" (Vl.x.28, line 3). Reconciled in spirit to the virtue of his Queen, Calidore can now return to his beloved\n\nPastorella. The thrust of what he sees points toward a vast firmament: \"For a moment the beloved is poised alone in a visionary splendor; in the next moment she recedes to make room for Gloriana though, with the words, 'Sunne of the world,' the two Ideas make brief contact.,,21\n\nThe vision on Mount Acidale reveals Spenser's indebtedness to traditional iconography. Although he may not have actually known of Botticelli's \"Primavera,\" Spenser works with the same principles that govern this composition. For instance, the painting shows Venus standing between two groups of maidens: one group produces an earthly Flora; but the other group contains a lovely Castitas, who turns toward a heavenly Mercury. Taken as a whole, this entire sequence (or action) reproduces the basic structure of Plotinian spirituality.22 The separate moments of this sequence only become \"simultaneous\" within the sphere of the canvas.\n\nAs a poet, Spenser reproduces the same movement by means of language. In the uncertain identity of the central figure on Mount Acidale, we discern the flickering visage of an earthly maiden or a celestial Queen. The rhythm of the poem intensifies from one stanza to the next: beauty that can only exist in time haunts us as it turns into silence. Calidore patiently listens, but he cannot separate himself from what he hears: his chivalrous mission may have led him to discover an actual Gloriana, but it also suggests that ideal beauty must transcend the limitations of space and time. Unlike the piping shepherd, Colin Clout, with whom the identity of the poet at last ceases to be confused, Calidore must live in the tension between ideals and their fulfillment. This tension commits him, in advance, to a future life of concrete acts and the company of historical persons. As he leaves his pastoral setting, Calidore prepares to perform his remaining duties.\n\nI would like to conclude this discussion by restating my position concerning the relevance of phenomenology to Spenser's work as an epic poet. On the one hand, what I have chosen to call Spenser's \"poetic phenomenology\" at least suggests that the traditional interpretation of this philosophical sources might be considered from a phenomenological standpoint. At the beginning of this paper, I alluded to the role that both Aristotle and Plato might have had in developing Spenser's concept of virtue. Within the course of the paper, however, I presented the goal of the Book of Courtesy in terms of a poetic phenomenology that helps situate the recovery of place within a narrative context. This goal is inseparable from the mission of Calidore himself as a typical\n\nrepresentative of Renaissance conceptions of virtue and political edu‚Ä∫ cation. At the same time, it cannot be identified too closely with Calidore's personal function in the epic narrative.\n\nThe recovery of place involves a slow spiritual awakening that embraces the lowest levels of erotic awareness as well as the highest reaches of \"ideal\" experience. While this phenomenological progres‚Ä∫ sion requires social interaction, it also assumes the form of a subjective adventure that does not completely coincide with the actions of any single character. At the end of Spenser's epic, therefore, the recovery of place becomes a sublime metaphor whose deeper meaning is corroborated by tradition and phenomenology alike: \"But what do I bid you love in the soul? the beauty of the soul. The beauty of bodies is a visible light, the beauty of the soul is an invisible light; the light of the soul is truth.'023\n\n## NOTES\n\n- 1 In this paper, I do not limit the meaning of phenomenology to the work of its founder, or to any single phase of its long development. Nevertheless, I derive the concept of \"imaginative fulfillment\" from Husserl's attempt to describe the experience of truth on a phenomenological basis. I believe that this concept can be related to a broad range of human activities. - 2 While the sense of place that relates to poetry may not coincide with truth, it opens up a world in which truth can occur. In Being and Time, Heidegger explores the concept of world as a phenomenological alternative to Cartesian dualism. His late writings on art and language demonstrate how this concept can be linked to place as a poetic concern. - 3 For instance, while FQ II.xii abounds in classical references, Spenser inverts a facile naturalism in his use of ancient sources. Guyon resembles Odysseus in his voyage into the Bower of Bliss, but he also shows how the rejection of artifice can parallel the affir‚Ä∫ mation of natural abundance as an ethically mediated value. - 4 By emphasizing the role of language in the recovery of place, I leave open the issue of whether or not interpretation must be onto logically grounded. On the other hand, I contend that imaginative fulfillment is already a \"linguistic\" phenomenon on the most primordial level. Hence my use of phenomenology is especially suited for the examina‚Ä∫ tion of literature. - S The claim that Calidore takes part in a phenomenological movement toward truth should not be confused with the identification of Calidore with an imputed narrative subject. While subjectivity plays a crucial role in Spenser's epic as a whole, Calidore himself is by no means the narrative \"center\" of Courtesy. - 6 Baldesar Castiglione, The Book of the Courtier, Book IV, sec. II, p. 295. - 7 See Aristotle, The Ethics of Aristotle, II. vi, pp. 70-71:\n\nIn the other sphere of the agreeable the general business of life the person who is agreeable, supposing him to have no ulterior object, is'obsequious'; if he has no such object, he is a'flatterer'. The man who is deficient in this quality and takes every opportunity of making himself disagreeable may be called'peevish' or'sulky' or'surly'.\n\n- 8 Aristotle, The Ethics, IX, p. 269. - 9 Aristotle, The Ethics, IX, p. 269. - 10 Graham Hough, A Preface to the Faerie Queene, p. 202. - II Harry Berger, \"A Secret Discipline: The Faerie Queene, Book VI,\" in Form and Convention in the Poetry of Edmund Spenser, p. 40. - 12 Berger, \"A Secret Discipline\" in Form and Convention, p. 5l. - 13 Cf.

In the political sphere, this means that Calidore's actions as a Renaissance courtier never leave the world of experience entirely behind. In the sphere of art, it means that the differ‚Ä∫ ence between the natural Pastorella and the supernatural Gloriana expresses an essential ambiguity that lies at the heart of the noematic correlate. - 19 Donald Cheney, Spenser's Image of Nature: Wild Man and Shepherd in the Faerie Queene, p.

Austin, from whom I have selected a quote as a motto for my paper.\n\n## 1. Dichotomies\n\nFirst of all, I want to say in advance that I am in agreement with Hookway's general presentation of Putnam's approach to distinctions and dichotomies. I will add here some comments of a historical and lexicographic character in order to gain a clearer view of the whole issue that may help to understand better pragmatism in general and Putnam's pragmatism in particular.\n\nIn the introduction to Classical American Philosophy, a collection of writings of Peirce, James, Royce, Santayana, Dewey and Mead, John J. Stuhr identifies seven characteristics that constitute a'family resemblance' amongst the six major American pragmatist philosophers. The first such characteristic is the rejection of modern philosophy's'dualism,' i.e. its habit of articulating and defending its positions in terms of dichotomies: subject/object, mind/matter, appearance/reality, theory/practice, facts/values, individual/community, and so on. Stuhr explains:\n\nClassical American philosophers did not refuse to use these terms; instead their point was that these notions refer to distinctions made in thought rather to different kinds of being or levels of existence. That is, these terms have a functional rather an ontological status; they stand for useful distinctions made within reflection, and not for different kinds of being, discrete and separate prior to reflection. (Stuhr 1987, p. 5)\n\nIn The Collapse of the Fact/Value Dichotomy Hilary Putnam aligns himself with this honorable tradition, crediting John Dewey's lifelong battle against dualisms as a source of inspiration For Putnam, distinctions are not dualisms or dichotomies (Putnam 2002, p. 9). 'The errors [...]' Hookway writes - 'arise only when such distinctions are transformed into'dichotomies.' Indeed Putnam agrees with Dewey that, in these cases we need both to understand'the importance of respecting the distinction' [Putnam 2002, p. 10] while recognizing the damaging effects of inflating it into a dichotomy' (Hookway 2004, pp. 1-2). On Putnam's account, harmless and innocent distinctions become - at least in some cases - metaphysical bogeys when inflated into absolute dichotomies. 'One difference between an ordinary distinction and a metaphysical\n\ndichotomy [is that] ordinary distinctions have ranges of application, and we are not surprised if they do not always apply' (Putnam 2002, p. 11).\n\nBut let us stop here for a while. What is a dichotomy? In order to answer this type of question I always love to go to Baldwin's Dictionary (1901-1905), which from time to time gives the gift of an entry by Charles S. Peirce. In the case of'dichotomy' the entry is by Robert Adamson, professor of Logic at Glasgow University, but Peirce is the coauthor of a related entry'Dualism (in Philosophy).' Here is Peirce's definition of'dualism':\n\n- (1) A general tendency to divide any genus of objects of philosophical thought into two widely separate categories, as saints and sinners, truth and falsehood, &amp;c.; opposed to the tendency to look for gradations intermediate between contraries. Especially (2) any theory which explains the facts of the universe by referring them to the action of two independent and eternally coexistent principles. (Baldwin 1901-1905, I, p. 298)\n\nIn his entry on'dichotomy,' Adamson explains that a dichotomy is'a form of logical division in which, at each step, the genus is separated into two species, determined by the possession and non possession, the presence and absence, of a mark or attribute. The species so determined satisfy the rules of division: they exclude one another, and they exhaust the extent of the genus divided.' Adamson describes cursorily the use of dichotomy by Plato and Aristotle, and suggests that the method of division by dichotomy'lies at the foundation of Jevons' and indeed of all symbolic logic,' because it'expresses the fundamental distinction in thought between position and negation' (Baldwin 1901-1905, I, p. 279).\n\nThe point I want to stress is that a'dichotomy' is mainly a form of logical division, of classification; that dichotomies appear when and where there are human beings thinking, classifying, establishing classes, collections and categories. To assert a dichotomy is to cut something into two parts which are'mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive' (Brody 1967, p. 60). This cut is a logical one, made by our reflection: it could be said that if were nobody to do the cutting there would be no dichotomies. I like to tell my students that in the middle of the sun there are no problems; that problems only appear where there are human beings thinking. The same could be said of dichotomies. In the world there are no dichotomies, but only continuity and interaction. Along this way, the only two ontological usages of'dichotomy' found in dictionaries - for instance the Oxford English Dictionary - come from astronomy ('That phase of the moon, (or of an inferior planet) at which exactly half the\n\ndisk appears illuminated') and from botany ('A form of branching in which each successive axis divides into two; repeated bifurcation').\n\nBut the phenomenon that Putnam has detected is the metaphysical inflation of a distinction that transforms a logical division into a metaphysical dichotomy, 'thought to be philosophically obligatory, both sides of the distinction were thought to be natural kinds, each a category whose members possessed an'essential property' in common' (Putnam 2002, p. 13). This could be a new usage of the term'dichotomy'. We human beings are very fond of making this type of division into two parts, and then promptly to forget that the division was made by us, with some practical purpose in mind in each case. We are tempted to believe that reality is divided in two according our dichotomy. As Putnam shows in detail, the transformation of a distinction into a metaphysical dichotomy turns the distinction into a Procrustean bed (cf. Putnam 2002, p. 27). Let's recall the story from Greek mythology: Procrustes was a bandit from Attica who had a bed which he invited passersby to lie down in. Those who were shorter than the bed he would stretch until they fit, while those who were too tall would have their legs chopped short.\n\n## 2. Ethical Concepts and Artifact Terms\n\nIn his book, Putnam demonstrates convincingly that'the fact/value dichotomy is, at bottom, not a distinction but a thesis, namely the thesis that'ethics' is not about'matters of fact'' (Putnam 2002, p. 19). Putnam identifies three reasons why we are tempted to establish the fact/value dichotomy. The first (and more dangerous) reason is that, like the Procrustean bed, this dichotomy is a way of cutting off not only rational argument about values, but even thought: 'The worst thing about the fact/value dichotomy is that in practice it functions as a discussionstopper; and not just a discussion-stopper, but a thought-stopper' (Putnam 2002, p. 44). As Putnam has written extensively elsewhere'a central insight in Dewey's ethics (and all of Dewey's work is in one way or another connected with'ethics') is that the application of intelligence to moral problems is itself a moral obligation ' (Putnam 2000, p. 10). This is the core of pragmatism and the distinctive mark of philosophy itself, and has been in the heart and in the texts of Putnam for at least the last two decades. Philosophy, as understood and lived by him, is'to do what Socrates tried to teach us: to examine who we are and what our deepest convictions are and hold those convictions up to the searching test of reflective examination' (Putnam 2002, p. 44).\n\nIn his lecture, Chris Hookway pays special attention to the entanglement of fact and value that appears in the use of words like'cruel', that have a mixed descriptive and normative function. Putnam holds that'the so-called thick ethical concepts are counterexamples to the claim that there is an absolute fact/value dichotomy' (Hookway 2004, p. 4; cf. Putnam 2002, p. 35), and he adds that this has long been pointed out by Philippa Foot, Iris Murdoch, John MacDowell and David Wiggins in their criticisms of the dichotomy. Putnam discusses with some detail the answers of R.M. Hare and John Mackie to those criticisms, but before doing so he announces that a possible Humean response would be just to banish all thick ethical concepts to the limbo of the'emotive' or'noncognitive' right along with the'thin' ones ('good,' 'ought,' 'right' et al. ). This would be a highly impoverished language. Putnam continues,\n\nFor a Spanish reader this historical reference Not even David Hume would be willing to classify, for example, 'generous,' 'elegant,' 'skillful,' 'strong,' 'gauche,' 'weak,' or'vulgar' as concepts to which no'fact' corresponds (Putnam 2002, 35). [And in a footnote Putnam adds] The words quoted in this sentence were listed as examples by Jos√© Ortega y Gasset, who noticed the phenomenon of entanglement very early. See his Obras Completas, vol. 6 (Madrid: Revista de Occidente, 1923). (Putnam 2002, pp. 317 and 320-321)\n\nFor a Spanish reader this historical reference - which already appears in Putnam's'Pragmatism and Relativism: Universal Values and Traditional Ways of Life' (Putnam 1994, pp. 188-189) - makes a lot of sense. The quotation from Ortega proceeds from his'Introducci√≥n a la estimativa' of 1918: it was his address for entering into the'Real Academia de Ciencias Morales y Pol√≠ticas'of Spain. I have defended for years - with small success until now! - the deep affinity between American pragmatism and Hispanic philosophers of the early decades of the twentieth century, such as Unanumo, Ortega and d'Ors (Nubiola 1998). In the case of Ortega, John Graham published in 1994 a careful study in which, after noting Ortega's hostility to American pragmatism, he reveals'many basic connections, similarities and points of identity, so that concrete influence and dependence seem more plausible than'coincidence' between Ortega and James.' Graham gives evidence that Ortega read James early in his career, and that Ortega was aware that James had anticipated the notion central to his of'raz√≥n vital ' (Graham 1994, pp. 145 and 147-152; see also Barzun 1984, p. 299). His evidence of James' influences on Ortega by German sources themselves influenced by James is specially convincing (Donoso 1995, p. 499).\n\nBack to the main line of my comment: Putnam's discussion of these thick ethical concepts show clearly the deep entanglement of fact and value or - what in the end is the same - that the dichotomy, as a sharp division, is really impossible, as it is said by Claudine Tiercelin in her delightful book on Putnam:\n\nThe border between fact and value is faint: the terms considered to have a function of ethical evaluation have also a descriptive explicative and predictive function. When somebody is qualified as'scrupulous,' at the same time one evaluates his or her character, one describes it. Understanding a human being is a mixture of estimation of his or her character and of explication and prediction of his or her actions'. (Tiercelin 2002, p. 50)\n\nIn his lecture, Hookway skillfully describes the problem of the mixture of evaluation and description that appears in these thick ethical concepts. However, for me the most interesting aspect is the unexpected turn that his reflection makes when he asks himself how far this strategy extends:\n\nIs it applied solely to words (like'cruel' and'kind', for example) that really do seem to have a centrally ethical or evaluative use? The question is: if this argument works for thick ethical concepts, how far does its application extend? Are there concepts that we would superficially think of as'descriptive' to which it applies? (Hookway 2004, p. 5).\n\nHookway chooses an excellent example in order to test the extension of the'semantic strategy' against the fact/value distinction: a'lamp'. This is the name of an artifact that surreptitiously - it is the same with all artifacts -reintroduces in the scene a mixture of description and evaluation:\n\nWe might think of a'lamp' as a wholly descriptive concept - certainly it does not embody any ethical evaluation. But identifying something as a lamp involves regarding it as having a distinctive use, as meeting some need or purpose. Nobody who failed to grasp how lamps are used, nobody who could not evaluate how suitable something was to meet the needs which lamps are designed to need, could properly apply the concept of a lamp as we do: a sensitivity to how we evaluate things as meeting the needs which lamps are designed to meet seems to be required for applying the term and assessing what falls in its extension. (Hookway 2004, p. 5)\n\nWhat is it to be a lamp? Is'lamp' in fact a pure descriptive term, or does not its use involve some evaluation about the extension of the concept? As most of the readers of this volume know, Putnam's view on\n\nnatural-kind terms as indexical can be extended also to artifacts. 'Pencil', 'chair' or'bottle' were the terms used by Putnam as paradigmatic examples in'The Meaning of'Meaning'':\n\n- [...] 'pencil' is not synonymous with any description - not even loosely synonymous with a loose description. When we use a word'pencil', we intend to refer to whatever has the same nature as the normal examples of the local pencils in the actual world. 'Pencil' is just as indexical as'water' or'gold'. (Putnam 1975, p. 243)\n\nAccording to Putnam, the nature of a pencil or of a lamp is not some mysterious structure underlying the surface characteristics of the object (for a discussion of this issue, see S.P. Schwartz 1978 and H. Kornblith 1980). With Aristotle we can say that the essence of an artifact is extrinsic to the artifact, is its utility, while the matter of its composition is accidental (Aristotle, Physics II, 2, 1929b 8-20): the function or utility of the artifact is the nature referred to by the user of the term'lamp' or'pencil'.\n\nMoreover, when we think about what it is to be a'proper lamp' or a'good lamp,' we realize that there is some hidden evaluation that governs the pragmatic application of the term, as Hookway's argument suggests. I agree with that, but my minor reply is that there are no sharp boundaries about what it is to be a lamp: a broken lamp or a miner's lamp are also lamps, in spite of the fact that I cannot use them on my desk. (By the way, Hookway has credited Peirce for the example of the lamp, and looking in Peirce's Collected Papers I found that there are eight occurrences of'lamp' there, and one of them is'Aladdin's lamp'! [Peirce 1931-1958, 6.552, 1887]) Let me quote here one of Wittgenstein's comments about lamps and their boundaries in his Philosophical Investigations:\n\nOne may say of certain objects that they have this or that purpose. The essential thing is that this is a lamp, that it serves to give light; - that it is an ornament to the room, fills an empty space, etc., is not essential. But there is not always a sharp distinction between essential and inessential. (Wittgenstein 1953, p. 62)\n\nHaving all this in mind, the last point I want to make in this section is that any dichotomy, like the fact/value dichotomy (which has been consistently rejected by Putnam as a metaphysical bogey), is also an artifact, a product of the human mind. It seems to me really important to realize that'dichotomies' are tools like lamps, drawn to get a clearer view of some area of philosophical discussion or in this case - as it was said earlier - unfortunately to stop any discussion at all. The making of\n\ndichotomies was perhaps seen by the vast majority of our colleagues in the past century as a useful tool to make philosophical progress; thanks, however, to Putnam's work we now realize that this distinction, especially when metaphysically inflated, blocks inquiry and distorts our view of rationality and human flourishing. We know now what the classic pragmatists already knew: that facts and values interpenetrate, that'value judgments are essential to the practice of science itself ' (Putnam 2002, p. 135). From a practical point of view, we have learned that the dichotomy between value judgments and judgments of facts was not really a dichotomy, i.e. a division of the judgments into two sub-classes mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive. Rather, it was an ideological thesis made in order to avoid philosophical discussion about values. This provides ample reason for the negative overtones of the term'dichotomy' in Putnam's writings.\n\n## 3. A Final Word on J.L. Austin\n\nAlmost thirty years ago I did my licentiate thesis on John Austin's analysis of truth, working closely on his William James Lectures (delivered at Harvard in 1955 and published posthumously as How to Do Things with Words ). Over the last ten years I have been teaching regularly Austin's philosophy of language, and I am persuaded of the deep affinity between Austin and the pragmatist tradition. In a footnote to chapter seven of The Collapse of the Fact/Value Dichotomy, Putnam writes: 'Most of the points I have attributed to'American pragmatism' in this chapter are also made by Austin - who, like Murdoch, appears not to have read the pragmatists' (Putnam 2002, p. 171, n. 24). My impression is that the view of language that Austin presents in the last lecture of How to Do Things with Words fits pretty well with a pragmatist approach to language.\n\nBut the point I want to highlight here is not only that John Austin, like Putnam, advocates the elimination of the contrast between the normative or evaluative and the factual, but he characterizes of this dichotomy in lecture XII as a'fetish.' According to the dictionary, a fetish is something'that is worshiped, because a spirit is believed to live in it,' or'to which more respect or attention is given than is normal or sensible' (Cowie 1990, p. 449). What Hilary Putnam has shown is that the'scientific spirit' that was embodied by that fetish is simply unscientific, and not only does not deserve any respect at all, but on the contrary has to be denounced systematically as a treason to philosophy\n\nand an attack on human flourishing. This is one of the treasures of the heritage of American pragmatism, and Putnam has been instrumental and influential in its rediscovery.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nI want to give thanks to Concepci√≥n Mart√≠nez and to Maria Uxia Rivas for their kind invitation to take part as a discussant of professor Hookway in the II Meeting on Pragmatism held in Santiago de Compostela, on May 13-14, 2004.

Based on the metaphor of bringing light to the Dark Age, the Age of the Enlightenment ( Si√®cle des lumi√®res in French and Aufkl√§rung in German) shifted allegiances away from absolute authority, whether religious or political, to more skeptical and optimistic attitudes about human nature, religion and politics. In the American context, thinkers such as Thomas Paine, James Madison, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams and Benjamin Franklin invented and adopted revolutionary ideas about scientific rationality, religious toleration and experimental political organization-ideas that would have farreaching effects on the development of the fledgling nation. Some coupled science and religion in the notion of deism; others asserted the natural rights of man in the anti-authoritarian doctrine of liberalism; and still others touted the importance of cultivating virtue, enlightened leadership and community in early forms of republican thinking. At least six ideas came to punctuate American Enlightenment thinking: deism, liberalism, republicanism, conservatism, toleration and scientific progress. Many of these were shared with European Enlightenment thinkers, but in some instances took a uniquely American form.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n1. Enlightenment Age Thinking 1.

Enlightenment Age Thinking\n\nThe pre- and post-revolutionary era in American history generated propitious conditions for Enlightenment thought to thrive on an order comparable to that witnessed in the European Enlightenments. In the pre-revolutionary years, Americans reacted to the misrule of King George III, the unfairness of Parliament ('taxation without representation') and exploitative treatment at the hands of a colonial power: the English Empire. The Englishman-cumrevolutionary Thomas Paine wrote the famous pamphlet The Rights of Man, decrying the abuses of the North American colonies by their English masters. In the post-revolutionary years, a whole generation of American thinkers would found a new system of government on liberal and republican principles, articulating their enduring ideas in documents such as the Declaration of Independence, the Federalist Papers and the United States Constitution.\n\nAlthough distinctive features arose in the eighteenth-century American context, much of the American Enlightenment was continuous with parallel experiences in British and French society. Four themes recur in both\n\nEuropean and American Enlightenment texts: modernization, skepticism, reason and liberty. Modernization means that beliefs and institutions based on absolute moral, religious and political authority (such as the divine right of kings and the Ancien R√©gime ) will become increasingly eclipsed by those based on science, rationality and religious pluralism. Many Enlightenment thinkers-especially the French philosophes, such as Voltaire, Rousseau and Diderot-subscribed to some form of skepticism, doubting appeals to miraculous, transcendent and supernatural forces that potentially limit the scope of individual choice and reason. Reason that is universally shared and definitive of the human nature also became a dominant theme in Enlightenment thinkers' writings, particularly Immanuel Kant's'What is Enlightenment?' and his Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals. The fourth theme, liberty and rights assumed a central place in theories of political association, specifically as limits state authority originating prior to the advent of states (that is, in a state of nature) and manifesting in social contracts, especially in John Locke's Second Treatise on Civil Government and Thomas Jefferson's drafts of the Declaration of Independence.\n\n## a. Moderate and Radical\n\nBesides identifying dominant themes running throughout the Enlightenment period, some historians, such as Henry May and Jonathan Israel, understand Enlightenment thought as divisible into two broad categories, each reflecting the content and intensity of ideas prevalent at the time. The moderate Enlightenment signifies commitments to economic liberalism, religious toleration and constitutional politics. In contrast to its moderate incarnation, the radical Enlightenment conceives enlightened thought through the prism of revolutionary rhetoric and classical Republicanism. Some commentators argue that the British Enlightenment (especially figures such as James Hutton, Adam Ferguson and Adam Smith) was essentially moderate, while the French (represented by Denis Diderot, Claude Adrien Helv√©tius and Fran√ßois Marie Arouet) was decidedly more radical. Influenced as it was by the British and French, American Enlightenment thought integrates both moderate and radical elements.\n\n## b. Chronology\n\nAmerican Enlightenment thought can also be appreciated chronologically, or in terms of three temporal stages in the development of Enlightenment Age thinking. The early stage stretches from the time of the Glorious Revolution of 1688 to 1750, when members of Europe's middle class began to break free from the monarchical and aristocratic regimes-whether through scientific discovery, social and political change or emigration outside of Europe, including America. The middle stage extends from 1751 to just a few years after the start of the American Revolution in 1779. It is characterized by an exploding fascination with science, religious revivalism and experimental forms of government, especially in the United States. The late stage begins in 1780 and ends with the rise of Napol√©on Bonaparte, as the French Revolution comes to a close in 1815-a period in which the European Enlightenment was in decline, while the American Enlightenment reclaimed and institutionalized many of its seminal ideas. However, American Enlightenment thinkers were not always of a single mind with their European counterparts. For instance, several American Enlightenment thinkers-particularly James Madison and John Adams, though not Benjamin Franklin-judged the French philosophes to be morally degenerate intellectuals of the era.\n\n## c. Democracy and the Social Contract\n\nMany European and American Enlightenment figures were critical of democracy. Skepticism about the value of democratic institutions was likely a legacy of Plato's belief that democracy led to tyranny and Aristotle's view that democracy was the best of the worst forms of government. John Adams and James Madison perpetuated the elitist and anti-democratic idea that to invest too much political power in the hands of uneducated and property-less people was to put society at constant risk of social and political upheaval. Although several of America's Enlightenment thinkers condemned democracy, others were more receptive to the idea of popular rule as expressed in European social contract theories. Thomas Jefferson was strongly influenced by John Locke's social contract theory, while Thomas Paine found inspiration in JeanJacques Rousseau's. In the Two Treatises on Government (1689 and 1690),\n\nLocke argued against the divine right of kings and in favor of government grounded on the consent of the governed; so long as people would have agreed to hand over some of their liberties enjoyed in a pre-political society or state of nature in exchange for the protection of basic rights to life, liberty and property. However, if the state reneged on the social contract by failing to protect those natural rights, then the people had a right to revolt and form a new government. Perhaps more of a democrat than Locke, Rousseau insisted in The Social Contract (1762) that citizens have a right of self-government, choosing the rules by which they live and the judges who shall enforce those rules. If the relationship between the will of the state and the will of the people (the'general will') is to be democratic, it should be mediated by as few institutions as possible.\n\n## 2. Six Key Ideas\n\nAt least six ideas came to punctuate American Enlightenment thinking: deism, liberalism, republicanism, conservatism, toleration and scientific progress. Many of these were shared with European Enlightenment thinkers, but in some instances took a uniquely American form.\n\n## a. Deism\n\nEuropean Enlightenment thinkers conceived tradition, custom and prejudice ( Vorurteil ) as barriers to gaining true knowledge of the universal laws of nature. The solution was deism or understanding God's existence as divorced from holy books, divine providence, revealed religion, prophecy and miracles; instead basing religious belief on reason and observation of the natural world. Deists appreciated God as a reasonable Deity. A reasonable God endowed humans with rationality in order that they might discover the moral instructions of the universe in the natural law. God created the universal laws that govern nature, and afterwards humans realize God's will through sound judgment and wise action. Deists were typically (though not always) Protestants, sharing a disdain for the religious dogmatism and blind obedience to tradition exemplified by the Catholic Church. Rather than fight members of the Catholic faith with violence and intolerance, most deists resorted to the use of tamer weapons such as humor and mockery.\n\nBoth moderate and radical American Enlightenment thinkers, such as James Madison, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, John Adams and George Washington, were deists. Some struggled with the tensions between Calvinist orthodoxy and deist beliefs, while other subscribed to the populist version of deism advanced by Thomas Paine in The Age of Reason. Franklin was remembered for stating in the Constitutional Convention that'the longer I live, the more convincing proof I see of this truth-that God governs in the affairs of men.' In what would become known as the Jefferson Bible (originally The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth ), Jefferson chronicles the life and times of Jesus Christ from a deist perspective, eliminating all mention of miracles or divine intervention. God for deists such as Jefferson never loomed large in humans' day-to-day life beyond offering a moral or humanistic outlook and the resource of reason to discover the content of God's laws. Despite the near absence of God in human life, American deists did not deny His existence, largely because the majority of the populace still remained strongly religious, traditionally pious and supportive of the good works (for example monasteries, religious schools and community service) that the clergy did.\n\n## b. Liberalism\n\nAnother idea central to American Enlightenment thinking is liberalism, that is, the notion that humans have natural rights and that government authority is not absolute, but based on the will and consent of the governed. Rather than a radical or revolutionary doctrine, liberalism was rooted in the commercial harmony and tolerant Protestantism embraced by merchants in Northern Europe, particularly Holland and England. Liberals favored the interests of the middle class over those of the high-born aristocracy, an outlook of tolerant pluralism that did not discriminate between consumers or citizens based on their race or creed, a legal system devoted to the protection of private property rights, and an ethos of strong individualism over the passive collectivism associated with feudal arrangements. Liberals also preferred rational argumentation and free exchange of ideas to the uncritical of religious doctrine or governmental mandates. In this way, liberal thinking was anti-authoritarian. Although later liberalism became associated with grassroots democracy and a sharp separation of the public and private domains, early liberalism favored a parliamentarian form of government that protected liberty of expression and movement, the right to petition the government, separation of church and state and the confluence of public and private interests in philanthropic and entrepreneurial endeavors.\n\nThe claim that private individuals have fundamental God-given rights, such as to property, life, liberty and to pursue their conception of good, begins with the English philosopher John Locke, but also finds expression in Thomas Jefferson's drafting of the Declaration of Independence. The U.S. Bill of Rights, the first ten amendments to the Constitution, guarantees a schedule of individual rights based on the liberal ideal. During the constitutional convention, James Madison responded to the anti-Federalists' demand for a bill of rights as a condition of ratification by reviewing over two-hundred proposals and distilling them into an initial list of twelve suggested amendments to the Constitution, covering the rights of free speech, religious liberty, right to bear arms and habeas corpus, among others. While ten of those suggested were ratified in 1791, one missing amendment (stopping laws created by Congress to increase its members' salaries from taking effect until the next legislative term) would have to wait until 1992 to be ratified as the Twenty-seventh Amendment. Madison's concern that the Bill of Rights should apply not only to the federal government would eventually be accommodated with the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment (especially its due process clause) in 1868 and a series of Supreme Court cases throughout the twentieth-century interpreting each of the ten amendments as'incorporated' and thus protecting citizens against state governments as well.\n\n## c. Republicanism\n\nClassical republicanism is a commitment to the notion that a nation ought to be ruled as a republic, in which selection of the state's highest public official is determined by a general election, rather than through a claim to hereditary right. Republican values include civic patriotism, virtuous citizenship and property-based personality. Developed during late antiquity and early renaissance, classic republicanism differed from early liberalism insofar as rights were not thought to be granted by God in a pre-social state of nature, but were the products of living in political society. On the classical republican view of liberty, citizens exercise freedom within the context of existing social relations, historical associations and traditional communities, not as autonomous individuals set apart from their social and political ties. In this way, liberty for the classical republican is positively defined by the political society instead of negatively defined in terms of the pre-social individual's natural rights.\n\nWhile prefigured by the European Enlightenment, the American Enlightenment also promoted the idea that a nation should be governed as a republic, whereby the state's head is popularly elected, not appointed through a hereditary blood-line. As North American colonists became increasingly convinced that British rule was corrupt and inimical to republican values, they joined militias and eventually formed the American Continental Army under George Washington's command. The Jeffersonian ideal of the yeoman farmer, which had its roots in the similar Roman ideal, represented the eighteenth-century American as both a hard-working agrarian and as a citizen-soldier devoted to the republic. When elected to the highest office of the land, George Washington famously demurred when offered a royal title, preferring instead the more republican title of President. Though scholarly debate persists over the relative importance of liberalism and republicanism during the American Revolution and Founding (see Recent Work section), the view that republican ideas were a formative influence on American Enlightenment thinking has gained widespread acceptance.\n\n## d. Conservatism\n\nThough the Enlightenment is more often associated with liberalism and republicanism, an undeniable strain of conservatism emerged in the last stage of the Enlightenment, mainly as a reaction to the excesses of the French\n\nRevolution. In 1790 Edmund Burkeanticipated the dissipation of order and decency in French society following the revolution (often referred to as'the Terror') in his Reflections on the Revolution in France. Though it is argued that Burkean conservatism was a reaction to the Enlightenment (or antiEnlightenment), conservatives were also operating within the framework of Enlightenment ideas. Some Enlightenment claims about human nature are turned back upon themselves and shown to break down when applied more generally to human culture. For instance, Enlightenment faith in universal declarations of human rights do more harm than good when they contravene the conventions and traditions of specific nations, regions and localities. Similar to the classical republicans, Burke believed that human personality was the product of living in a political society, not a set of natural rights that predetermined our social and political relations. Conservatives attacked the notion of a social contract (prominent in the work of Hobbes, Locke and Rousseau) as a mythical construction that overlooked the plurality of groups and perspectives in society, a fact which made brokering compromises inevitable and universal consent impossible. Burke only insisted on a tempered version, not a wholesale rejection of Enlightenment values.\n\nConservatism featured strongly in American Enlightenment thinking. While Burke was critical of the French Revolution, he supported the American Revolution for disposing of English colonial misrule while creatively readapting British traditions and institutions to the American temperament. American Enlightenment thinkers such as James Madison and John Adams held views that echoed and in some cases anticipated Burkean conservatism, leading them to criticize the rise of revolutionary France and the popular pro-French Jacobin clubs during and after the French Revolution. In the forty-ninth Federalist Paper, James Madison deployed a conservative argument against frequent appeals to democratic publics on constitutional questions because they threatened to undermine political stability and substitute popular passion for the'enlightened reason' of elected representatives. Madison's conservative view was opposed to Jefferson's liberal view that a constitutional convention should be convened every twenty years, for '[t]he earth belongs to the living generation,' and so each new generation should be empowered to reconsider its constitutional norms.\n\n## e. Toleration\n\nToleration or tolerant pluralism was also a major theme in American Enlightenment thought. Tolerance of difference developed in parallel with the early liberalism prevalent among Northern Europe's merchant class. It reflected their belief that hatred or fear of other races and creeds interfered with economic trade, extinguished freedom of thought and expression, eroded the basis for friendship among nations and led to persecution and war. Tiring of religious wars (particularly as the 16 th century French wars of religion and the 17 th century Thirty Years War), European Enlightenment thinkers imagined an age in which enlightened reason not religious dogmatism governed relations between diverse peoples with loyalties to different faiths. The Protestant Reformation and the Treaty of Westphalia significantly weakened the Catholic Papacy, empowered secular political institutions and provided the conditions for independent nation-states to flourish.\n\nAmerican thinkers inherited this principle of tolerant pluralism from their European Enlightenment forebearers. Inspired by the Scottish Enlightenment thinkers John Knox and George Buchanan, American Calvinists created open, friendly and tolerant institutions such as the secular public school and democratically organized religion (which became the Presbyterian Church). Many American Enlightenment thinkers, including Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, read and agreed with John Locke's A Letter Concerning Toleration. In it, Locke argued that government is ill-equipped to judge the rightness or wrongness of opposing religious doctrines, faith could not be coerced and if attempted the result would be greater religious and political discord. So, civil government ought to protect liberty of conscience, the right to worship as one chooses (or not to worship at all) and refrain from establishing an official state-sanctioned church. For America's founders, the fledgling nation was to be a land where persons of every faith or no faith could settle and thrive peacefully and cooperatively without fear of persecution by government or fellow citizens. Ben Franklin's belief that religion was an aid to cultivating virtue led him to donate funds to every church in Philadelphia. Defending freedom of conscience, James Madison would write that '[c]onscience is the most sacred of all property.' In 1777, Thomas Jefferson drafted a religious liberty bill for Virginia to disestablish the government-sponsored Anglican Church-often referred to as'the precursor to the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment'-which eventually passed with James Madison's help.\n\n## f. Scientific Progress\n\nThe Enlightenment enthusiasm for scientific discovery was directly related to the growth of deism and skepticism about received religious doctrine. Deists engaged in scientific inquiry not only to satisfy their intellectual curiosity, but to respond to a divine calling to expose God's natural laws. Advances in scientific knowledge-whether the rejection of the geocentric model of the universe because of Copernicus, Kepler and Galileo's work or the discovery of natural laws such as Newton's mathematical explanation of gravity-removed the need for a constantly intervening God. With the release of Sir Isaac Newton's Principia in 1660, faith in scientific progress took institutional form in the Royal Society of England, the Acad√©mie des Sciences in France and later the Academy of Sciences in Germany. In pre-revolutionary America, scientists or natural philosophers belonged to the Royal Society until 1768, when Benjamin Franklin helped create and then served as the first president of the American Philosophical Society. Franklin became one of the most famous American scientists during the Enlightenment period because of his many practical inventions and his theoretical work on the properties of electricity.\n\n## 3. Four American Enlightenment Thinkers\n\nWhat follows are brief accounts of how four significant thinkers contributed to the eighteenth-century American Enlightenment: Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison and John Adams.\n\n## a. Franklin\n\nBenjamin Franklin, the author, printer, scientist and statesman who led America through a tumultuous period of colonial politics, a revolutionary war and its momentous, though no less precarious, founding as a nation. In his Autobiography, he extolled the virtues of thrift, industry and money-making (or acquisitiveness). For Franklin, the self-interested pursuit of material wealth is only virtuous when it coincides with the promotion of the public good through philanthropy and voluntarism-what is often called'enlightened self-interest.' He believed that reason, free trade and a cosmopolitan spirit serve as faithful guides for nation-states to cultivate peaceful relations. Within nation-states, Franklin thought that'independent entrepreneurs make good citizens' because they pursue'attainable goals' and are'capable of living a useful and dignified life.' In his autobiography, Franklin claims that the way to'moral perfection' is to cultivate thirteen virtues (temperance, silence, order, resolution, frugality, industry, sincerity, justice, moderation, cleanliness, tranquility, chastity, and humility) as well as a healthy dose of'cheerful prudence.' Franklin favored voluntary associations over governmental institutions as mechanisms to channel citizens' extreme individualism and isolated pursuit of private ends into productive social outlets. Not only did Franklin advise his fellow citizens to create and join these associations, but he also founded and participated in many himself. Franklin was a staunch defender of federalism, a critic of narrow parochialism, a visionary leader in world politics and a strong advocate of religious liberty.\n\n## b. Jefferson\n\nA Virginian statesman, scientist and diplomat, Jefferson is probably best known for drafting the Declaration of Independence. Agreeing with Benjamin Franklin, he substituted'pursuit of happiness' for'property' in Locke's schedule of natural rights, so that liberty to pursue the widest possible human ends would be accommodated. Jefferson also exercised immense influence over the creation of the United States' Constitution through his extended correspondence with James Madison during the 1787 Constitutional\n\nConvention (since Jefferson was absent, serving as a diplomat in Paris). Just as Jefferson saw the Declaration as a test of the colonists' will to revolt and separate from Britain, he also saw the Convention in Philadelphia, almost eleven years later, as a grand experiment in creating a new constitutional order. Panel four of the Jefferson Memorial records how Thomas Jefferson viewed constitutions: 'I am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions, but laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind. As that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths discovered and manners and opinions change, with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times.' Jefferson's words capture the spirit of organic constitutionalism, the idea that constitutions are living documents that transform over time in pace with popular thought, imagination and opinion.\n\n## c. Madison\n\nHeralded as the'Father of the Constitution,' James Madison was, besides one of the most influential architects of the U.S. Constitution, a man of letters, a politician, a scientist and a diplomat who left an enduring legacy on American philosophical thought. As a tireless advocate for the ratification of the Constitution, Madison advanced his most groundbreaking ideas in his jointly authoring The Federalist Papers with John Jay and Alexander Hamilton. Indeed, two of his most enduring ideas-the large republic thesis and the argument for separation-of-powers and checks-and-balances-are contained there. In the tenth Federalist paper, Madison explains the problem of factions, namely, that the development of groups with shared interests (advocates or interest groups) is inevitable and dangerous to republican government. If we try to vanquish factions, then we will in turn destroy the liberty upon which their existence and activities are founded. Baron d' Montesquieu, the seventeenth-century French philosopher, believed that the only way to have a functioning republic, one that was sufficiently democratic, was for it to be small, both in population and land mass (on the order of Ancient Athens or Sparta). He then argues that a large and diverse republic will stop the formation of a majority faction; if small groups cannot communicate over long distances and coordinate effectively, the threat will be negated and liberty will be preserved ('you make it less probable that a majority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of other citizens'). When factions formed inside the government, a clever institutional design of checks and balances (first John Adams's idea, where each branch would have a hand in the others' domain) would avert excessive harm, so that'ambition must be made to counteract ambition' and, consequently, government will effectively'control itself.'\n\n## d. Adams\n\nJohn Adams was also a founder, statesman, diplomat and eventual President who contributed to American Enlightenment thought. Among his political writings, three stand out: Dissertation on the Canon and Feudal Law (1776), A Defense of the Constitutions of Government of the United States of America, Against the Attack of M. Turgot (1787-8), and Discourses on Davila (1791). In the Dissertation, Adams faults Great Britain for deciding to introduce canon and feudal law, 'the two greatest systems of tyranny,' to the North American colonies. Once introduced, elections ceased in the North American colonies, British subjects felt enslaved and revolution became inevitable. In the Defense, Adams offers an uncompromising defense of republicanism. He disputes Turgot's apology for unified and centralized government, arguing that insurance against consolidated state power and support for individual liberty require separating government powers between branches and installing careful checks and balances. Nevertheless, a strong executive branch is needed to defend the people against'aristocrats' who will attempt to deprive liberty from the mass of people. Revealing the Enlightenment theme of conservatism, Adams criticized the notion of unrestricted popular rule or pure democracy in the Discourses. Since humans are always desirous of increasing their personal power and reputation, all the while making invidious comparisons, government must be designed to constrain the effects of these passionate tendencies. Adams writes: 'Consider that government is intended to set bounds to passions which nature has not limited; and to assist reason, conscience, justice, and truth in controlling interests which, without it, would be as unjust as uncontrollable.'\n\n## 4. Contemporary Work\n\nInvocations of universal freedom draw their inspiration from Enlightenment thinkers such as John Locke, Immanuel Kant, and Thomas Jefferson, but come into conflict with contemporary liberal appeals to multiculturalism and pluralism. Each of these Enlightenment thinkers sought to ground the legitimacy of the state on a theory of rational-moral political order reflecting universal truths about human nature-for instance, that humans are carriers of inalienable rights (Locke), autonomous agents (Kant), or fundamentally equal creations (Jefferson). However, many contemporary liberals-for instance, Graeme Garrard, John Gray and Richard Rorty-fault Enlightenment liberalism for its failure to acknowledge and accommodate the differences among citizens' incompatible and equally reasonable religious, moral and philosophical doctrines, especially in multicultural societies. According to these critics, Enlightenment liberalism, rather than offering a neutral framework, discloses a full-blooded doctrine that competes with alternative views of truth, the good life, and human nature. This pluralist critique of Enlightenment liberalism's universalism makes it difficult to harmonize the American Founders' appeal to universal human rights with their insistence on religious tolerance. However, as previously noted, evidence of Burkean conservatism offers an alternative to the strong universalism that these recent commentators criticize in American Enlightenment thought.\n\nWhat in recent times has been characterized as the'Enlightenment project' is the general idea that human rationality can and should be made to serve ethical and humanistic ends. If human societies are to achieve genuine moral progress, parochialism, dogma and prejudice ought to give way to science and reason in efforts to solve pressing problems. The American Enlightenment project signifies how America has taken a leading role in promoting Enlightenment ideals during that period of human history commonly referred to as'modernity.' Still, there is no consensus about the exact legacy of American Enlightenment thinkers-for instance, whether republican or liberal ideas are predominant. Until the publication of J. G. A. Pocock's The Machiavellian Moment (1975), most scholars agreed that liberal (especially\n\nLockean) ideas were more dominant than republican ones. Pockock's work initiated a sea change towards what is now the widely accepted view that liberal and republican ideas had relatively equal sway during the eighteenthcentury Enlightenment, both in America and Europe. Gordon Wood and Bernard Bailyn contend that republicanism was dominant and liberalism recessive in American Enlightenment thought. Isaac Kramnick still defends the orthodox position that American Enlightenment thinking was exclusively Lockean and liberal, thus explaining the strongly individualistic character of modern American culture.\n\n## 5.
