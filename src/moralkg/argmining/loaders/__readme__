Purpose
- Load PhilPapers metadata, associated paper text, and workshop annotations for downstream AM.

Exposed API (planned)
- Dataset: single entrypoint
  - attributes: metadata (dict[id → fields]), annotations (dict[id → parsed map] | None)
  - methods (planned): get_paper(id) -> str; iter_split(split="validation"|"holdout") -> iterator of (id, text, annotation?)

Config usage
- paths.philpapers.metadata: file or directory; if dir, load newest file. Builds `metadata` keyed by paper id.
- paths.philpapers.docling.cleaned: directory with `<id>.md` or `<id>.txt` used by get_paper.
- workshop.annotations.use: "large" | "both" → paths.workshop.annotations.{large_maps,small_maps}.
- snowball.annotations.holdout: float ratio for stratified split (by category).

Notes
- Parsing to `ArgumentMap` should use `moralkg.argmining.parsers.Parser` and `schemas` types.
- Current status: class stub exists; loading, splitting, and indexing helpers are not yet implemented.
