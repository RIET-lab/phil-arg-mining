Pipeline orchestration for Phase 1.

This folder contains code for composing and running generation pipelines, including orchestrators that coordinate batch, I/O and model calls. Current file: `orchestrator.py`.

TODO for `__init__.py`:
- Expose the `PipelineOrchestrator` / `Orchestrator` class and helper functions to build pipelines.
- Export any lightweight pipeline config dataclasses used by callers.
- Avoid importing modules that trigger model initialization on import; keep imports lazy.
- Ensure public API is explicit (use __all__) and well-documented.
