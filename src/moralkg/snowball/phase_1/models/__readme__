Model utilities for Phase 1.

This directory contains model registry and lightweight model-related helpers. Current file: `registry.py`.

TODO for `__init__.py`:
- Re-export the central `ModelRegistry` (or similar) and model factory functions.
- Define and export public type aliases for model interfaces used by the phase (e.g. `LLMModel`, `ModelSpec`).
- Avoid importing heavy ML frameworks at import time â€” use lazy imports within factory functions.
