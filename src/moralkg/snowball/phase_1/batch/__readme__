Batch utilities for Phase 1 generation.

This directory contains code that batches multiple generation requests, schedules jobs, and provides helpers to split/aggregate prompt batches. Current implementation includes `generation.py`.

TODO for `__init__.py`:
- Provide a clear, small public API (e.g. `BatchGenerator`, `create_batches`).
- Re-export only lightweight types and factory functions; avoid importing heavy model/LLM libraries at module import time.
