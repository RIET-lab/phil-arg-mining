Step 4: Provide missing, implied conclusions (claims) and implied premises. An implied claim should only be added if it is necessary to the argument’s logical validity and seems likely to be endorsed by the argument’s author.

Task:
Add any extra missing, implied premises that make the argument logically coherent.

Guidelines:
- Only add implied claims that are necessary for the argument's validity and are likely endorsed by the author.
- Label each added claim explicitly as 'implied'.
- For each implied claim, include a one-line rationale explaining why it is required and which explicit claims it connects.
- Keep implied claims minimal to avoid over-interpretation.

- ID: <number or label>
	Quote: "<quote>"
	Text: <rewritten text>
	Type: Major Claim | Claim
    isImplied: True
    Rationale: <brief explanation>
