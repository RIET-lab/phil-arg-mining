Step 1: Identify all the claims being made by the author.

Task:
Identify all claims in the target text. A claim is any statement that asserts something to be true, evaluates, or takes a position.

Guidelines:
- Output a numbered list of exact quoted spans from the text.
- Include only spans that function as claims; exclude pure exposition, examples, or background unless they contain an assertion.
- Preserve original punctuation and capitalization in the 'quote'.

Required format (plain text):
- ID: <number> 
    Quote: "<quote>"
