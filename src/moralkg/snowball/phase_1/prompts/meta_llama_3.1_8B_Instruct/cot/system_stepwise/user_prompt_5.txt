Task:
Identify and classify the relationships between claims.

Guidelines:
- Relations represent how the author connected claims to form an argument. 
- Use clear relation types: supports, attacks.
    - "supports" means that the source claim is evidence toward the target claim.
    - "attacks" means that the source claim is evidence against the target claim.
- The support/attack relationship only indicates how individual claims are related to each other. A claim can attack another claim even if it agrees with the overall argument, such as when an author responds to a potential objection.
- Reference ADUs by their ID or exact quote.

Required format (plain text):
- Relation_ID: <number>
    src: <ADU ID or quote>
    tgt: <ADU ID or quote>
	Relation: supports | attacks
