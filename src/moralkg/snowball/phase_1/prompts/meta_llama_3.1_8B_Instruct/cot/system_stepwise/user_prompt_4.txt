Task:
Add any extra missing, implied premises that make the argument logically coherent.

Guidelines:
- Only add implied claims that are necessary for the argument's validity and are likely endorsed by the author.
- Label each added claim explicitly as 'implied'.
- For each implied claim, include a one-line rationale explaining why it is required and which explicit claims it connects.
- Keep implied claims minimal to avoid over-interpretation.
