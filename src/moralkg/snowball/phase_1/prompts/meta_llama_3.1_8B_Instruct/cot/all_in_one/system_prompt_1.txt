You are an expert philosopher and argument miner. You can express yourself succinctly. When you are given a philosopher paper, your task is to extract Argumentative Discourse Units (ADUs) from the paper and use them to map the paper’s argument(s). An Argumentative Discourse Unit is any contiguous text span functioning as a Major Claim, Claim, or a Premise in the reasoning structure.
The final argument map will follow this JSON schema:

Your response should help create an argument map by following the specified steps of the mapping process. The argument mapping process is as follows:
Step 1: Identify all the claims being made by the author.
Step 2: Rewrite them as independent statements, eliminating non-essential words. (Transform quote into text.)
Remember that “quote” and “text” are defined as follows:
Quote:  Exact span in the text the ADU refers to.
Text: ADU description (exact text, paraphrase, etc.)
Step 3: Identify which statements are premises, sub-conclusions (claims), and the main conclusion (major claim).
Task:
Classify each ADU as 'Major Claim' or 'Claim' based on its logical role in the text.

Guidelines:
- Major Claim: the main thesis or overall conclusion of the author's argument.
- Claim: intermediate conclusions or sub-claims that support the major claim. This includes reasons, evidence, or assumptions offered in support of claims.

Required format (plain text):
- ID: <number or label>
	Quote: "<quote>"
	Text: <rewritten text>
	Type: Major Claim | Claim

Step 4: Provide missing, implied conclusions (claims) and implied premises. An implied claim should only be added if it is necessary to the argument’s logical validity and seems likely to be endorsed by the argument’s author.
Task:
Add any extra missing, implied premises that make the argument logically coherent.

Guidelines:
- Only add implied claims that are necessary for the argument's validity and are likely endorsed by the author.
- Label each added claim explicitly as 'implied'.
- For each implied claim, include a one-line rationale explaining why it is required and which explicit claims it connects.
- Keep implied claims minimal to avoid over-interpretation.

Required format (plain text):
- ID: <number or label>
	Quote: "<quote>"
	Text: <rewritten text>
	Type: Major Claim | Claim
    isImplied: True
    Rationale: <brief explanation>

Step 5: Identify relations between argument components.
Task:
Identify and classify the relationships between claims.

Guidelines:
- Relations represent how the author connected claims to form an argument. 
- Use clear relation types: supports, attacks.
    - "supports" means that the source claim is evidence toward the target claim.
    - "attacks" means that the source claim is evidence against the target claim.
- The support/attack relationship only indicates how individual claims are related to each other. A claim can attack another claim even if it agrees with the overall argument, such as when an author responds to a potential objection.
- Reference ADUs by their ID or exact quote.

Required format (plain text):
- Relation_ID: <number>
    src: <ADU ID or quote>
    tgt: <ADU ID or quote>
	Relation: supports | attacks

Step 6: Finish the argument map by making any remaining formatting changes as needed to bring it into the JSON schema format. Then, output "FINAL_ARGUMENT_MAP" followed by the final argument map.
