Task:
Rewrite quoted claims as independent, standalone statements (the 'text'). Clean hedges and context-dependent phrasing while preserving the claim's logical meaning.

Guidelines:
- Provide both the original quote and the rewritten text.
- Keep rewrites short and declarative. Remove phrases like "it seems", "might be", "in my view" unless they change the claim's force.
- When paraphrasing, preserve quantifiers and modal strength (e.g., "must", "might", "probably").

Required format (plain text):
- ID: <number or label> 
    Quote: "<quote>"
    Text: <rewritten text>
