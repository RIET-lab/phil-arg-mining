Preprocessing utilities for PDFs, metadata, and annotation prep used across pipelines.

metadata -> OAI harvest/parse/combine/reformat utilities for PhilPapers/PhilArchive.
pdfs -> download PDFs from metadata; filters and retries.
docling -> PDF → Markdown/Text/JSON with optional GPU, plus text filtering.
grobid -> reference pipeline for TEI/XML references.
annotations -> build workshop samples; prepare directories for labels/arguments; legacy scripts.

scripts/metadata.py -> end‑to‑end metadata pipeline (harvest → parse → combine → reformat).
scripts/pdfs.py -> download PDFs based on filtered metadata.
scripts/docling.py -> run Docling.
scripts/annotations.py -> create sampling CSV and prepare folders for labeling.
