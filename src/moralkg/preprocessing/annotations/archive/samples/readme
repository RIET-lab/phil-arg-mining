title semantic meaning

Clustering algorithm (based around centroids for title)

First determine which columns are most important (what to index it on)
Give everything to the clustering algorithm (more or less) - or only give it the data you care about
Decide on clustering algorithm
Throw in index data to clustering algorithm - each point that comes out is a paper
Uniform sampling from each cluster that appears

Valid with tests - histogram the most important metrics and make sure they look nice and uniform

I could also just do clustering agnostic of authors and ensure dup authors aren't allowed into final set. If a dup author is found just sample another

when in doubt make it none overlapping - at most an equal weighting per author.
