## GOAL
Argumentâ€‘mine the following paper to extract its comprehensive argumentative structure.

## DEFINITIONS
1. **Argument**: A set of propositions, including some number of premises and a conclusion. The premises should logically entail the conclusion.
2. **Claim**: A proposition that asserts something to be true or false, typically requiring justification or evidence.
3. **Premise**: A proposition that provides evidence, justification, or logical support for a claim or conclusion.

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS
1. **VERBATIM EXTRACTION ONLY**: Each ADU text must be copied EXACTLY from the paper with no modifications, paraphrasing, or combining of separate sentences.
2. **NO HALLUCINATION**: Do not create, modify, or invent text that does not appear exactly in the source.
3. **EXACT MATCHING**: Every word, punctuation mark, and spacing must match the original precisely.

## DIRECTIONS
1. **Identify Argumentative Discourse Units (ADUs)**  
   - ADU = any contiguous text span functioning as a claim or a premise in the reasoning structure.
   - **BE HIGHLY SELECTIVE**: Only include ADUs that are crucial to the overarching argument structure.
   - Focus on significant claims and premises that contribute meaningfully to the argumentative flow.
   - **AVOID NOISE**: Skip ADUs that are merely descriptive, tangential, or do not substantially advance the argument.
   - Prioritize quality over quantity - fewer accurate, important ADUs are better than many insignificant ones.
   - **EXTRACT ONLY**: Copy text spans exactly as they appear, without any modifications.
2. **Classify each ADU**  
   - Label = either `"claim"` or `"premise"`.  
3. **Detect directed relations**  
   - Relation = `"support"` or `"attack"`, from one ADU (source) to another (target).
   - Map how ADUs connect to form reasoning chains.
   - Focus on relationships between the most significant ADUs.
   - Include relationships between premises that strengthen or weaken each other.
4. **Verbatim spans**  
   - Each `"text"` value must be copied EXACTLY from the paper with zero modifications.
   - Do not paraphrase, summarize, or combine separate sentences.
   - Do not add, remove, or change any words, punctuation, or spacing.
   - If unsure about exact wording, skip that ADU rather than guess.

## WHAT TO CAPTURE
**INCLUDE ONLY:**
- Main argumentative threads that are central to the paper's contribution
- Core claims that represent the paper's primary arguments or findings
- Key premises that provide essential support for major claims
- Critical counterarguments and their refutations
- Reasoning chains that demonstrate how main conclusions are derived

**EXCLUDE (AVOID NOISE):**
- Minor details, examples, or descriptive content that don't advance the argument
- Tangential points or side discussions
- Pure background information or literature review content
- Methodological details unless they constitute argumentative claims
- Obvious statements or commonly accepted facts
- Redundant or repetitive argumentative content

**GUIDING PRINCIPLE**: If removing an ADU would not significantly impact understanding of the paper's argumentative structure, it should be excluded.

## QUALITY CONTROL
- Before finalizing each ADU, verify the text exists exactly in the source
- Prefer fewer, accurate ADUs over many potentially modified ones
- When in doubt about exact wording, omit the ADU
